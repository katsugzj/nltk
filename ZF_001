<ABSTRACT>To achieve Motorola's production goal of only four rejected
semiconductors in one million, the company is teaming up with
Applied Intelligent Systems Inc (AISI) to develop a new generation
of intelligent artificial-vision systems.&P;  The quality control
system utilizes Motorola's 68040 microprocessor and AISI's new
imaging computer, which features neutral-network technology and a
proprietary chip named Firefly.&P;  The intended system not only
offers faster image processing, but extends the quality control
benefits to many other areas of factory operations.&P;  By combining
the versatility of neutral-network software with a massively
parallel computer, the company hopes to prevent defects from
happening in the first place.&P;  The neutral-network computer has as
many as 512 parallel processors under the control of a 68040
microprocessor on one printed-circuit card that simply plugs into
an IBM PC AT.&M;

<TEXT>

On Friday (Dec.&P;  21), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted the
application of In-Flight Phone Corp. (IFPC) to provide nationwide
air-to-ground radio telephone service.&M;

The FCC's decision is the result of a decade of debate within the commission
over how best to allocate these channels in order to serve the public
interest.&M;

In June of this year the FCC chose to adopt the Sharing Plan proposed by John
D. ("Jack') Goeken, the founder of the IFPC and Airfone.&M;

IFPC has already spent more than $8 million over the last 18 months designing
a new digital air-to-ground system that will help reduce the airlines'
operating costs and will provide high quality voice communications and data
services for their passengers that will make travel time more productive and
enjoyable.&M;

According to Mark Ferdinand, president and chief operating officer of IFPC,
digital transmission is far superior to the present analog system.&P;  To
further improve the quality of transmission the company is using a unique
method of voice-coding algorithms that greatly reduces cabin background
noise; test results have been better than expected.&M;

According to Sandra K. Goeken, chairman and chief executive officer of IFPC,
"We're ready, willing and able to take off and we're right on schedule!&P;  IFPC
will be considered the leader in this new air-to-ground industry bringing
innovative high-quality services and approaches which will benefit both the
airlines and their passengers.&P;  It's a great day."&O;

US Sprint Wednesday announced a transpacific cable agreement that will give
the company an international fiber-optic network with fully redundant
connectivity from Europe to Japan through the United States.&M;

A milestone supporting the company's commitment to build a global fiber-optic
highway, this agreement more than doubles US Sprint's fiber capacity in the
Pacific region.&M;

US Sprint has purchased an ownership interest in North Pacific Cable (NPC), a
transpacific fiber-optic cable project of Pacific Telecom Cable Inc., of the
United States, Cable and Wireless plc of the United Kingdom and International
Digital Communications Inc., of Japan.&M;

This new cable capacity, scheduled to be operational by March 1991, enhances
the US Sprint fiber-optic network with a completely diverse route,
survivability and improved reliability.&M;

"NPC is also an important link in our plans to build a global digital
fiber-optic highway." said Martin Tate, director of international facilities
development for Sprint International, US Sprint's global telecommunications
and private networks subsidiary.&M;

"Traffic growth in the Pacific Rim is outpacing every other region in the
world," said Michael Robinson, US Sprint's director of international network
and capacity management.&P;  "This new cable capacity expands US Sprint's fiber
technology to the Far East and complements our existing fiber capabilities to
Europe, advancing US Sprint's network quality on a global basis."&M;

NPC will be the first direct link between the United States and Japan and is
the highest capacity fiber-optic cable authorized for the Pacific region.&O;
Construction is slated for completion in December 1990.&P;  NPC connects the
United States to Japan via a 5,200-mile great circle route.&M;

On the United States end, NPC will interconnect with Sprint's domestic
digital network and to Sprint's PTAT-1 and other transatlantic cables.&P;  In
Japan, interconnections will be with the domestic Japanese networks and to
expanding digital facilities serving the growing economies of Southeast Asia.&M;

Pacific Telecom Cable Inc., based in Vancouver, Wash., is a majority-owned
subsidiary of Pacific Telecom Inc., a PacifiCorp company.&O;

UNIX System Laboratories, Inc. (USL), a subsidiary of AT&amp;T which supplies the
UNIX operating system, Wednesday filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission provisions for an employee unit plan designed to give employees a
stake in the success of the open systems software industry.&M;

The filing is part of a plan to fulfill commitments AT&amp;T made last year to
establish USL as an independent entity by sharing ownership of the company
with employees and companies committed to providing open computing systems to
end users.&M;

The employee plan, which is expected to take effect early next year, is
linked to a private placement of shares in USL, which is now being made to
leading members of the information industry commited to open computing
systems.&P;  After the offering is completed, outside investors will own between
20 and 30 percent of USL.&M;

USL will be governed by a nine-member board of directors, the composition of
which will reflect outside ownership of the company.&P;  Three directors will be
nominated by investors.&P;  Six directors will be nominated by AT&amp;T.&P;  Two of the
nine will be "independent directors,"  not affiliated with AT&amp;T or any
investor.&P;  Board membership will be adjusted to reflect any decrease of
AT&amp;T's ownership of USL.&M;

USL's relationship with UNIX International, Inc., a consortium of more than
200 UNIX System vendors, will be unchanged.&P;  UNIX International, through the
UNIX System V Roadmap process, will continue to provide technical and market
requirements to USL for future enhancements to the UNIX System V operating
system and related system software.&M;

These actions, taken together, will result in the establishment of USL as an
independent system software company, charged with providing UNIX System and
related systems software to all members of the information industry.&M;

UNIX System Laboratories, Inc., develops and markets the UNIX System V
operating system, the TUXEDO Transaction Processing System, OSI networking
software, the C++ programming language and other open systems software in
source code form to computer industry vendors worldwide.&P;  USL has two
subsidiaries: UNIX System Laboratories Europe Ltd., headquartered in London,
and UNIX System Laboratories Pacific, Ltd., headquartered in Tokyo.&O;

<ABSTRACT>Media access control (MAC)-layer bridges allow for connectivity
between Ethernet and token-ring local area networks (LAN).&P;  Like
other bridges, MAC-layer bridges filter and forward packets inside
a LAN.&P;  In addition, they do frame conversion; they convert
packets from both Ethernet and token-ring formats while
maintaining destination information.&P;  MAC-layer bridges are able
to support several protocols including the Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet (TCP/IP) and Novell Inc's Internetwork Packet
Exchange (IPX), but they do not convert higher-level protocols.&O;
Several products are available for establishing physical-layer
Ethernet and token-ring connectivity.&P;  Among them are CrossComm
Corp's 4,000 packet/sec ILAN bridge that costs $7,900 and
Ungermann-Bass Inc's Access/One Ethernet Token-Ring Data Link
Bridge, which is only 100 packet/sec slower than ILAN and costs

<ABSTRACT>From its survey of information systems (IS) executives from 394
major North American corporations, Index Group Inc reports that IS
managers are planning to combine IS and network technology with
business operations in order to provide better service for
customers.&P;  Investments in electronic data interchange, local area
networks, data base management systems and imaging technologies
are expected to increase despite budget restrictions.&P;  IS managers
surveyed claim reshaping business practices as the priority
management issue, and that automation of outdated practices is not
the only appropriate answer.&P;  Respondents to the survey also
reported that senior managers do not understand the benefits
gained from the combination of information technology and business
practices.&M;

<ABSTRACT>TRW Electronics Systems Group is implementing AT&amp;T's Rhapsody
Business Orchestration Solution office automation system.&O;
Rhapsody, a LAN-based groupware product, is expected to reduce TRW
Electronics Systems Group's purchase order preparation time from
100 days from 50 days.&P;  It will allow purchasing agents access to
about 30 data bases on various processors through windows.&O;
Rhapsody also provides prompts about tasks that have to be done
based on a predefined schedule.&P;  TRW's Rhapsody system uses two
Unix-based servers which support 80 AT&amp;T 80386 DOS-based
microcomputers.&P;  The microcomputers are linked together on an
Ethernet network.&P;  Rhapsody uses AT&amp;T's desktop graphical user
interface based on Microsoft Windows and HP's NewWave
object-oriented software.&P;  Rhapsody is quoted by AT&amp;T to cost
$8,500 per user on a 20-workstation system, and each server packet
costs $70,000.&M;

<TEXT>
<ABSTRACT>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) introduces a standard
for a dual-use routing protocol for Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) networks.&P;  The Integrated Intermediate
System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) supports both TCP/IP and OSI
networks using a single routing protocol.&P;  The IETF, an informal
standards group for Internet, may decide to endorse the Open
Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol instead of IS-IS, however.&O;
The two protocols are incompatible.&P;  OSPF is able to route the
least expensive path in a network, but cannot support OSI.&P;  IS-IS
can build a network supporting TCP/IP and OSI.&P;  DEC is
implementing IS-IS in its DECnet Phase V, but other router vendors
are supporting OSPF.&M;

</AUTHOR>
<TEXT>
<ABSTRACT>Large companies are expanding their virtual networks into their
employees' homes in an effort to reduce communications costs and
extend employee work days.&P;  The strategy provides the added
advantage of generating greater network traffic that, in turn,
leads to volume discounts.&P;  Virtual networks, such as AT&amp;T's
Software-Defined Network (SDN) service and MCI Communications
Corp's Vnet, offer such features as seven- and 10-digit on-network
calling, call routing, international calling and 9.6K-bps data
transmission.&P;  SDN calls cost less than direct-dial long-distance
calls.&P;  Critics contend, however, that the 'administrative
nightmare' of call authorization documentation and the cost of
rebilling could wipe out the advantages of extending virtual
networks.&P;  Companies are responsible for all charges incurred by
their employees.&M;

<TEXT>
<ABSTRACT>The Department of Commerce forecasts that 1991 revenue growth for
domestic and international telecommunications services will
decline by one-half of a percentage point, in spite of increased
network traffic.&P;  Price decreases that followed divestiture
spurred an increase in average daily local and international
calls.&P;  The slowdown of revenue growth can be attributed to a
deteriorating economy which is causing companies to cut down on
network budgets.&P;  Users, however, can expect stable rates from the
competition between the major carriers.&P;  The carriers are spending
more money to upgrade and maintain digital networks in order to
improve the quality of services and to increase reliability.&P;  The
fractional T-1 market is expected to continue its 50 percent or
more growth rate in 1991, while newer technologies such as
Integrated Services Digital Networks will experience continued
sales.&P;  operating companies that recover instantly after network
failures.&M;

<TEXT>
<ABSTRACT>Revco Drug Stores Inc installs a private X.25 backbone network
with funds freed up by its filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.&P;  The
network allows the drug store chain's pharmacies to access Revco's
and insurance companies' data bases in order to verify if a
prescription is covered by the customer's policy.&P;  The on-line
process takes between 10 and 15 seconds to provide the needed
information, as opposed to the three minutes required by Revco's
older, less precise computer system.&P;  The network uses an IBM
3090-200 mainframe supporting point-of-sale and accounting
applications and an eight-processor Cyclone computer from Tandem
Computers Inc. The two computers are linked to four Netrix Corp
#1-Integrated Switching System (ISS) circuit/packet switches by
X.25 links.&P;  Fifty three stores are linked by 56K-bps fractional
T-1 lines from MCI Communications Corp to #1-ISS 30 Netrix
switches.&P;  The rest of the stores are connected to the network
through 56K-bps dedicated lines.&M;

<ABSTRACT>A General Accounting Office (GAO) report states that the Defense
Data Network (DDN) costs more than comparable network
telecommunications services, such as the Federal
Telecommunications Service 2000.&P;  The GAO claims that by requiring
defense-related agencies to use DDN, the Defense Department is
overlooking cheaper and more efficient network services.&P;  The GAO
also points out that the DDN is incompatible with many of the
agencies' equipment and that the packet-switching architecture
cannot handle data communications speeds required by certain
agencies.&P;  The Air Force, for example, requires T-1 transmission
speeds which the DDN is incapable of handling.&P;  The GAO reports
that the cost of using the DDN runs from 39- to 558 percent higher
than other communications services.&M;

<ABSTRACT>MCI Communications Corp files a complaint with the FCC claiming
that AT&amp;T is violating the Communications Act of 1934 by bundling
its 800 and Software Defined Network (SDN) services.&P;  MCI says
that AT&amp;T offers discounts for customers using bundled 800 and SDN
packages.&P;  AT&amp;T discounts the allegation by saying that an 800
number was offered for customers who use a service called Network
Remote Access Option III-Express.&P;  The 800 number allows customers
to access networks from an off-network site but is not equivalent
to its high-volume 800 services.&P;  MCI claims it has evidence of
customers who were offered SDN services and could use their
existing 800 number.&P;  The company warns that if the FCC rules in
favor of AT&amp;T, it is the customers who will be hurt by reduced
competition.&M;

multiple rates but only up to 19.2K-bps.&P;  Fixed rate DSUs
operating at 56K-bps that have a secondary channel for network
management will have increased sales.&P;  Switched 56K-bps DSUs will

link them to microcomputers running on their LANs.&P;  Medlantic
Health Care's TCP/IP network supports IBM 3270-type terminals
which can access the VAXcluster.&P;  The TCP/IP network also allows
DEC VT-320 terminals talk to the IBM mainframe through a 112K-bps
subchannel on a T-1 network.&P;  The T-1 network supports both the
TCP/IP protocol and IBM's Systems Network Architecture.&P;  Medlantic
Health Care wants to link up the LANs because many departments in
its three hospitals are setting up 3Com LANs which allow for
easier patient lab result data entry.&M;

were passive devices, but IBM and DEC are introducing intelligent
versions of the units.&P;  IBM is introducing its Controlled Access
Unit, a smart MAU.&P;  The new smart hubs do not support routing and
do not offer Ethernet and token-ring LAN support from a single

<ABSTRACT>Nevada law enforcement agencies implement a central
store-and-forward message switching system called the Law
Enforcement Message Switching (LEMS) system.&P;  The system uses two
Unisys 2200/401 mainframes to handle up to 200,000 transactions
each day.&P;  The system accesses data bases from state law
enforcement agencies, university police agencies, federal and
California agencies.&P;  Officers on patrol receive responses to
inquiries within seconds.&P;  The system links the mainframes to a
Unisys Distributed Communications Processor supporting 32
dedicated lines to various police departments around Nevada.&P;  The
mainframes act as gateways to the Federal Bureau of
Investigations' National Crime Information Center and National Law
Enforcement Telecommunications System.&M;

<ABSTRACT>Network World's User Advisory Panel recommends that information
systems managers present to upper management the strategic
benefits of network projects in addition to bottom-line analysis
reports.&P;  Executives looking for cost-justifications should be
made aware of soft-dollar benefits including customer loyalty,
corporate image and increased productivity.&P;  Members of the User
Advisory Panel, which include network executives and user group
representatives, stress the importance of showing management the
strategic importance of proposed network projects if a
cost/benefit analysis is lacking.&P;  Projects stand a better chance
of getting approval if network managers can show that competitors
are using similar plans with success, the Panel claims.&M;

<ABSTRACT>Network Management Inc (NMI) introduces the $24,000 International
Modular Interactive-Network Designer (I-MIND), software that
creates simulated models of international networks for the purpose
of optimizing their performance and helping users choose the least
expensive architecture for international private-line networks.&O;
The software package also can provide information on international
gateway private-line tariffs in over 80 countries, as well as the
domestic tariffs of six European countries.&P;  I-MIND runs on
IBM-compatible microcomputers, requires 15Mbytes of hard disk
space and needs 480Kbytes of memory.&P;  NMI suggests that users
implement a color monitor and video graphics board to support
I-MIND's graphics features.&P;  A monthly update of I-MIND tariff
listings is provided by NMI on floppy disks.&M;

<ABSTRACT>The International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee
(CCITT) issues new recommendations regarding international private
network regulation.&P;  The recommendations call for loosening of
foreign regulations having to do with the resale of private-line
capacity by users.&P;  Foreign regulatory agencies have, in the past,
not allowed the resale of capacity on international private lines,
fearing loss of revenue for state-owned switched services.&O;
Another recommendation is for carriers to price private-line
network services more competitively and for them to allow users to
interconnect international private lines.&P;  The recommendations
drafted by CCITT are the most liberal yet proposed by the
international organization.&M;

<ABSTRACT>The European Commission's green paper on satellite communications
recommends freer competition among national telecommunications
administrations.&P;  Those administrations presently hold a monopoly
on satellite services and earth stations receiving and
transmitting satellite signals.&P;  Most European governments are
expected to enact legislation based on the green paper's
recommendations.&P;  Germany and Great Britain already are engaging
in freer competition practices.&P;  Automobile manufacturers,

<ABSTRACT>Image-X International Inc introduces the $695 PSERVER, a printer
utility that allows terminals to request Image-X and ImageMate
imaging servers to print text and image files over a local-area
network-based imaging environment.&P;  The package is composed of two
software modules.&P;  A requester module resides in a minicomputer or
mainframe and lets the attached terminals request printouts of
image and text printouts.&P;  The server-based module deals with the
image scanning and compression on the Image-X file server or
ImageMate processor.&P;  Requests may be sent over Ethernet,
token-ring local area network (LAN) or asynchronous communications
lines to the server or imaging processor.&P;  The server or imaging
processor locates a requested file, decompresses it and sends the
data to a local printer.&M;

<ABSTRACT>Smaller and mid-sized businesses are benefitting from vendors who
are exploring new market opportunities by offering less-restricted
service network service contracts.&P;  The mature network market for
Fortune 500 companies is turning vendors' attention to smaller
companies seeking network services ranging from assessment studies
to outsourcing services.&P;  The competition between vendors is
causing them to develop new technologies and ways to differentiate
themselves.&P;  Users can expect to choose from a variety of
multi-tiered support programs, but they should not negotiate
contracts which might discourage vendors from providing quality

<ABSTRACT>T-1 and T-3 suppliers claim that Synchronous Optical Network
(SONET) standards are not well-established and that SONET service
is unreliable.&P;  The equipment requirements are already established
for SONET, and certain management-related standards, such as
message set definition, are presently being worked out.&P;  T-3
advocates argue that SONET fiber optic lines are susceptible to
accidental cuts thus threatening data loss.&P;  SONET lines are
designed with redundancy and alternate routes are available in
case of accidents.&P;  Add/drop and terminal multiplexers enable
SONET carriers and users to monitor networks and to offer
connectivity with other network forms such as T-3.&P;  The large
amounts of fiber optic lines installed by local and long-distance
telephone companies make SONET a viable alternative to the
proprietary nature of T-3.&M;

<ABSTRACT>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has
approved a standard media access control (MAC)-layer bridge called
the 802.1d bridge which is based on the Spanning Tree Algorithm.&O;
MAC is part of the data link layer of the Open Systems
Interconnection (OSI) model.&P;  The 802.1d bridge uses a technique
called flooding which sends messages throughout a network in order
to learn the location of all the other bridges.&P;  The 802.1d bridge
then assigns addresses to the various bridges and forms a
reference table which it uses when sending packets.&P;  The 802.1d is
unable to translate Ethernet version 2 to token-ring or Fiber
Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) to the IEEE's 802.3 standard.&M;

Best Buy to sell consumer electronics at near the wholesale price,
but Best Buy's Japanese suppliers - Onkyo USA Corp and Mitsubishi

associate professor of Management and Organization at the

already are providing advanced services ranging from videotex and
cable TV to fiber optic-based distance learning and telemarketing.&O;
For example, VICOM Information Services, a videotex subsidiary of
Chillicothe Telephone Co, Chillicothe, OH, offers more than 50
programs and databases to 600 customers.&P;  VICOM's director,
Charles Knowles, says that the inability or unwillingness of
national videotex players to successfully market videotex results
in a lack of industrywide standards and inexpensive, mass-produced
terminals, making it hard for small companies to survive.&O;

<ABSTRACT>Victor Schnee and Walter Gorkiewicz published a study in 1976
titled The Future of AT&amp;T, predicting that competition in the

and profit margins and challenging the idea of AT&amp;T's
technological superiority.&P;  The report was dismissed, but since
then much of it has proved accurate.&P;  Now, Schnee, together with
co-author Allan Tumolillo, has published another report -
Takeover: Taking Over the Telephone Companies - which forecasts an
upheaval in the local exchange carrier industry.&P;  According to the
new report, tremendous opportunities are opening up in the area of
local loop services, but telephone companies are focused on
protecting local monopolies and are not positioning themselves to
capitalize on the situation.&P;  This strategy leaves telephone
companies vulnerable to innovative competitors and possibly to

<ABSTRACT>Companies are moving towards producing low-emission video display
terminals (VDTs) not because of health concerns, but because of
market forces.&P;  Many manufacturers of VDTs state that they will be
making models that emit reduced levels of very low frequency (VLF)
electromagnetic radiation; some companies plan to reduce even the
very low frequency (VLF) emissions on their VDTs.&P;  Many of these
companies believe that their current models of VDTs are safe to
use but admit that the demand for reduced emissions is growing.&O;
The US industry is moving toward the conservative Swedish
standard, which goes into effect in Sweden in Jan 1, 1991 and was
developed by the country's National Board for Measurement and

OBJECTS FOR REAL "If I hear about one more graphical object that knows how to
draw itself on the screen I'll go bananas," Alice confided to us recently.&P;  A
long-suffering corporate programmer, she's more interested in re-using
applications code than icons at a time when such screen trinkets are a dime a
dozen.&P;  Where are the class libraries of employees, customers, payments,
products -- the things business deals with instead of the things computers
(and programmers) deal with?&P;  Programmers may be productive in producing
code, but are they productive in getting an organization's work done?&P;  Class
libraries will ultimately enable systems analysts and non-programming
designers to reuse more code from fewer programmers, making those programmers
de facto more productive even if the amount and quality of their code stays
the same.&M;

Well, just in time for Christmas we found someone working on precisely such a
class library.&P;  The project isn't done yet, and the resulting class library
won't be available on the open market (unless current plans change), but the
story is instructive and inspiring anyway.&P;  It concerns Hewitt Associates, a
company with deep expertise in a particular, rapidly moving field, which is
now embodying that expertise in object-oriented software for easy reuse.&O;
Indeed, its class libraries and the promise of easy reuse and modification
may enable Hewitt Associates to address a much larger base of smaller
customers who could not be effectively served the old,
one-at-a-time-from-scratch way.&M;

We also look at HumanCAD, with its almost-object Mannequins, and Echelon,
which is using low-end microprocessors to make household devices and factory
and office equipment into smart objects that can interact.&M;

Hewitt Associates&M;

Hewitt Associates, based in bucolic splendor just north of Chicago, has a
long-standing reputation as the source for employee benefits and compensation
consulting.&P;  Its clients include 75 percent of the Fortune 500; it provides
data-processing services for about 500 clients as well as benefits and
compensation consulting for about 5000 clients overall.&M;

Hewitt Associates is the outfit you see quoted in yearly surveys of bonuses,
pension-plan trends, and so forth.&P;  Unlike most consulting firms (with
notable exceptions such as McKinsey, KPMG and Andersen Consulting), the firm
invests heavily in R&amp;D that isn't directly billable.&P;  For example, in the
seventies, it was a driving force behind flex (cafeteria-style) benefit
plans, which allow employees to select from a variety of benefits as long as
they total less than a specified maximum.&P;  Think of the processing challenge
of keeping track of all these individual plans with all their individual
parameters!&P;  Computers made them possible.&M;

Founded as an actuarial firm in 1940, Hewitt Associates some years ago took
on the benefit administration task for many of its clients, offering both
economies of scale in operations and the quality and speed of software
development that come from doing similar projects over and over.&P;  By now, the
firm has 500 administration-services clients, each with its own customized
software, and is growing the business as it becomes more complex and less
appealing for clients to handle inhouse.&P;  Not only does Hewitt have to tailor
systems for each of these clients, but it has to apply updates to each
client's software each time Congress changes the tax laws or the IRS
reinterprets them or issues new regulations; each time the tax court makes a
significant ruling; and each time some insurance company comes up with some
new product that gets widely adopted.&P;  The result was clear, says project
leader Tim Hilgenberg: "Fear of maintenance.&P;  As we amassed clients, we were
building up a big liability in future maintenance obligations, changing
hundreds of tailored systems a year.&P;  We didn't want to spend all our time on
maintenance."&P;  But with all those customized systems, that was a real
possibility.&M;

A problem's an opportunity if you can solve it better than the next guy&M;

Call it a heavy burden -- or a huge opportunity.&P;  For if Hewitt Associates
can build software and modify it more quickly and more effectively than the
competition (or inhouse efforts), it will have a huge competitive advantage.&O;
Accordingly, the firm decided a year ago to switch from building each
client's system one at a time to a way to assemble them from modular,
modifiable components.&P;  "We needed a way to manage change better," says
Hilgenberg.&M;

The traditional approach, of course, would be to build a large, modifiable
application, which could be customized for each client.&P;  The problem was,
clients really didn't even want all the same applications -- the range of
benefits, plans, options, and administrative procedures just varies too much
from company to company.&P;  Some companies administer these things centrally,
out of the treasury; others, out of human resources; some, from headquarters,
others, within each division, plant or whatever.&P;  Some have mainframes and
terminals; others have minis, pcs or networks hooked into Hewitt's computers.&O;
Some pay their employees weekly, others twice a month, and so forth.&P;  And of
course the benefits vary widely, from various insurance plans to a variety of
perks and benefits, including day care, subsidized housing, education plans,
and various complicated bonus or profit-sharing schemes.&M;

The answer: relevant objects!!&M;

Certainly, there should be a lot of code you could share, to say nothing of
the knowledge accumulated by each of Hewitt Associates' professional
employees, but how to organize it all?&M;

You can only reuse code if you can define it properly and find it to reuse.&O;
But in the typical system, the code is all over the place.&P;  When the
government changes a regulation, it usually has impacts on a variety of
aspects in a variety of plans.&P;  How do you find all those places to make the
fix?&P;  And how do you limit the side-effects of the changes you make?&M;

The obvious answer, for any modish firm, is an object-oriented system, with
everything represented as objects.&P;  And indeed that's the approach Hewitt
Associates took, in a project led by Hilgenberg, a partner who has been with
the firm since 1978.&P;  The team built a quick prototype in Smalltalk, which
looked appealing and proved the object-oriented concept, but it was only a
demo.&P;  Since Hewitt's clients are mostly COBOL users, it wanted something
that conformed to IBM's SAA, including CUA (Common User Access) specs,
supported DB2 and other SQL databases, and had a graphical user interface.&M;

The project represents a substantial commitment for Hewitt Associates, with
60 people drawn from its three benefit administration services, plus its own
MIS group.&P;  The goal (which is not the case currently) is that all three
administrative practices will use the same underlying software, sharing many
class libraries and providing a single interface to the user.&P;  This will
enable much better communication among different systems, and help Hewitt
Associates both in cross-selling and installing incremental systems.&M;

Long-term, we assume, client payroll and accounting departments, with whom
the Hewitt systems now communicate mostly by large-scale file transfers, will
somehow share Hewitt's classes so that such systems can be better integrated.&O;
In the same way, in other industries, clients of service firms or software
users may share objects representing various kinds of products and services,
ranging from building supplies and machine components to mortgages or various
grades of shipping or cleaning services.&P;  (EDI, which sets standards for
invoices, payment terms and the like, is an example of such standards, but
they aren't represented as objects yet.)&P;  But all that's a long way off.&M;

Class-consciousness&M;

Right now Hewitt Associates has defined the object classes, and is working on
the implementation details.&P;  The three main classes are employees (with
salaries, hours, employment histories, dependents, tax status, eligibility,
medical conditions), plans (with rules, policies, conditions, constraints,
applicability, required contributions and payouts) and events (payments,
contributions, loans).&P;  All these are fairly abstract and guide the logic of
the program.&P;  A second consideration is implementation and interface: On what
platforms are the programs executed and how do they communicate with users?&O;
And, for each function, are the users the actual plan participants, who would
use it once in a while, or dedicated people in human resources who could be
expected to learn an application and want shortcuts?&M;

The idea is to build a collection of functional objects and implementation
systems that can be assembled to meet any client's particular needs.&P;  Second,
when the inevitable rule changes occur, only those modules affected need to
be changed, and will be easily reachable.&P;  For example, restrictions on
benefit payouts or a change in administrative procedures might cut across a
variety of plans in Hewitt's entire installed base, while a change in a
single company's definition of eligibility for retirement benefits would
require wholesale modification of that client's software -- and might be
restricted by laws or union contracts in various jurisdictions.&M;

The reality of dealing with objects&M;

The big disappointment, Hilgenberg says, is the lack of tools to do all this.&O;
Hewitt Associates decided to build its own object-oriented COBOL, with a
pre-processor that converts it into regular COBOL to be compiled the normal
way.&P;  (Micro Focus plans to offer one, but there's no announced date and it
will run only on pcs with DOS, OS/2 and UNIX.&P;  Hewitt Associates needs to
address a much broader variety of client systems.&P;  There's also a standards
committee sponsored by Codasyl developing a spec for object-oriented COBOL,
but there's no product out that meets it yet -- contrary to a lot of
standards which are just ratifications of a market leader or gang wars
against a market leader.)&M;

Once compiled, the COBOL applications are fielded normally.&P;  The difference
is that they are much more easily changeable, either because of external
regulatory changes or because of changes in policies or procedures by
clients.&P;  Obviously, the appeal to clients is that they're still dealing with
familiar-looking COBOL; however, Hewitt Associates discourages them from
changing the code, because such client modifications don't get retained in
subsequent versions of a system (see below).&M;

Thus, consider the Hewitt system a special sort of CASE tool for generating
traditional applications, rather than an object-oriented environment for
users.&P;  Its job is to make it easier to design benefit administration
systems.&P;  The output is an application which goes off and does its work.&O;
When things change, the tool is used again to assembled a new system with
only a few of its parts changed -- and changed correctly to work together
smoothly.&M;

As noted, these objects embody detailed regulatory knowledge, business rules
and procedures about how people earn salaries and benefits, get sick pay,
select plans, schedule vacations and so forth.&P;  But the construction of the
objects is only part of the challenge.&P;  Building an individual system also
requires a way to define precisely what system should be built.&P;  Which
objects do you want to use?&P;  Which rules do you want to embody?&M;

For that part of the process, Hewitt Associates is designing an expert-system
configuration tool, using Aion's Aion Development System.&P;  This tool is a
traditional expert system which runs the designer through a dialogue,
eliciting the necessary information on the specific policies and procedures
to implement.&P;  It knows what choices are compatible, and which objects to use
to represent them.&P;  Questions start out from the basic -- how many and what
kinds of plans? what pay periods? -- to the complex, from how compensation is
determined, how benefits should be calculated, and so forth.&M;

The output of the expert system selects the objects (modules of source code
to be compiled) to build the system, and provides the proper parameters.&P;  The
resulting system is "cooperative": Both application code and data will reside
in an IBM/DB2 environment on a mainframe, cooperating with an OS/2 front-end
using PM screens implemented with Choreographer from GUIdance Technologies.&O;
(Prototype screens were built with Asymetrix ToolBook.)&P;  Someday, of course,
such a cooperative architecture could just as easily support a telephone
voice-response system or a kiosk in an employee lounge.&M;

Hewitt Associates had originally thought to build "client-server" systems,
with database servers, and object-oriented applications and GUIs on the
front-end.&P;  But it soon became clear that keeping the applications
centralized made more sense, thus sharing the application logic as well as
the data and making administration easier.&P;  Although each client's
application set is unique, it is generally implemented only once, allowing
for sharing of the implemented system within a client application, as well as
reuse of the objects across clients.&P;  What Hewitt is creating is "application
servers," with the application implemented as class methods.&P;  (Cf.&P;  Sybase's
Open Server for MVS, Release 1.0, 90-9, which similarly encapsulates
mainframe applications and transactions and allows front-ends to share not
just data but business knowledge implemented in applications.)&P;  Local
differences, concerning platforms and interface details, are implemented
locally, in the front-ends.&M;

A head ahead&M;

Hewitt Associates won't say when it plans to launch the resulting systems,
but we suspect it will be at least a year or two.&P;  At that point Hewitt
Associates will probably be leading the pack with an actual system, although
many of the ideas it's pursuing now will be more widely accepted if not yet
implemented.&P;  But even with the so-called miracle of object-oriented
programming, implementation and knowledge is a large part of the game.&O;
Hewitt's edge is still the expertise that it can now resell and reconfigure
easily, not its coding skills.&P;  Object-orientation simply makes that body of
experience easier to exploit.&M;

Consider Hewitt Associates a new-form publisher, interpreting the
government's ever-changing regulations.&P;  Its medium is not binders full of
descriptions of policies and advice on procedures; it is executable systems
that will do the work in the way and on the machines the client finds most
convenient.&M;

Hewitt is not alone in the idea of using a hybrid of specific knowledge and
(semi-) automatic system generation to produce easily customizable and
updatable applications for a variety of platforms.&P;  TI has just announced a
reconfigurable investment management package built using its IEF and a
relational database.&P;  Andersen Consulting has a variety of such systems
targeted at several industry-specific tasks, based on its Foundation CASE
system.&P;  But no significant such tools, so far as we know, use
object-orientation to the extent that Hewitt Associates does.&O;

HUMANCAD: CLIP-PEOPLE Here's another example of useful objects: HumanCAD's
Mannequins, designed ultimately to be marketed and sold as active objects,
rather than used for internal development.&P;  For the moment, they're still
compiled internally and sold to the world as data files with an accompanying
application, but the company's near-term goal (release 2, next year) is to
ship working objects.&M;

HumanCAD is a division of Biomechanics Corporation of America, a
"quantitative ergonomics" consulting firm founded in 1986 by Cliff Gross,
formerly an NYU professor and head of New York Institute of Technology's
ergonomics department.&P;  Biomechanics clients include Ford, GM, DuPont,
Procter &amp; Gamble, and Lear Seating.&P;  Much like Hewitt Associates,
Biomechanics has developed software to enhance and implement its services.&O;
BackSoft is a tool for clinicians to use in assessing back injuries and their
implications: Can Juan still do heavy lifting?&P;  How much should we compensate
Alice for her on-the-job back injury?&P;  ErgoBase is a database of ergonomic
statistics on body sizes and body types, collected from a variety of
population studies from a variety of government and commercial sources.&M;

About a year ago, the company decided capitalize further on its expertise and
created an independent division, HumanCAD, to embody and market its knowledge
about human forms and structure.&P;  Gross's practice was based on ergonomics,
but Biomechanics director Howard Morgan, a former academic and now a venture
capitalist, broadened the scope of the project to a wider vision, including
applications not just in product design but in training, publishing (both
paper and electronic multimedia), advertising storyboards and the like.&O;
Morgan signed on as president, although the division is managed day to day by
Ken Goodman, former marketing vp for Generic Software.&M;

The resulting product, Mannequin, is a construction kit for 3D human figures
that can be used with a variety of design, presentation and publishing
software.&P;  Mannequin extends the clip-art concept (see Release 1.0, 89-1, on
clip objects) to wireframe human figures that do more than just look good:
They move properly, and have fields of vision, and reaches and grasps.&O;
Mannequin costs $699 and runs on a pc.&P;  It can export files to programs such
as AutoCAD, Generic CADD, Corel Draw, PageMaker or MicroGrafx Designer, and
supports most Mac graphics formats.&M;

Mannequin allows a user to create a generic person of specific sex,
nationality, age (3 to 12 or adult), and body type.&P;  (You can also specify
precise dimensions for various body parts, and have the rest constructed to
scale.)&P;  The figure thus created comes with the appropriate specs for joint
movement and range of vision.&P;  Using Mannequin's language or a mouse, you can
make the figure walk along a path you draw or specify, pick up an item of a
particular weight and size and put it somewhere, look at a wall, and so
forth.&P;  Once you've designed your hot new sports car with AutoCAD, for
example, you can try it out on a 6-foot overweight French male before
inflicting it on a real human (and paying in time and money for a prototype).&O;
Can the six-footer fit in the seat?&P;  Could a 5'3" Hong Kong female see out
the window? Is the control panel conveniently placed?&P;  If not, it's back to
the drawing board -- uh, workstation -- before much damage is done.&P;  Would
the six-footer be comfortable in a cubicle with this arrangement of
furniture?&P;  How would his movements block the lighting?&P;  The figures can be
used to display the answers to such questions on the screen or on printouts.&M;

Inside Juan and Alice&M;

Mannequin also handles more complex matters: For example, it can calculate
torques and stresses for people moving or lifting objects, including a
repetition factor.&P;  It can deal with questions such as, Should a normal
worker be expected to lift these boxes for hours at a time?&P;  Says Morgan,
weighing his (intangible) words carefully, "We won't say whether or not
someone of a certain stature can do a job, but we would give you information
that might enable you to draw that conclusion."&M;

With Mannequin you can automatically create lifelike simulations -- as
opposed to the animations of other pc tools, where you basically have to
build the system screen by screen, with the help of some functions such as
tweening.&P;  Mannequin's figures are the forerunner of a new growth industry:
supplying virtual objects for use in virtual worlds (see Release 1.0, 90-10).&O;
By supporting the AutoCAD format, they promise to be compatible with what
will likely be a leading standard environment for virtual reality.&O;
Eventually, with third-party tools for rendering and the like, it should be
possible to people semi-realistic worlds -- or make safety-training films.&M;

New and to be improved&M;

But the Mannequin objects aren't quite ready yet.&P;  For now, they are still
program modules and data structures with some content rather than fully
defined, active objects.&P;  Although the code was written in Borland C++, what
the user buys is compiled C code (not C++ source) that can be modified only
with parameters, not with additional code (or methods/behaviors) -- much like
the classes Hewitt Associates is creating.&P;  The classes can be modified only
by going back to the vendor (page 4).&M;

In the case of Mannequin, the objects have inheritance and behavior (for
calculating a field of vision, for example) when they're constructed, but
their real-time behavior, such as walking, stays under traditional program
control.&P;  There's a walking routine in the Mannequin package that knows how
to make a human walk based on the object's parameters and position, but the
routine is not stored with the object itself; it's part of the Mannequin
application -- and thus not exportable when you transfer either an object or
an animation sequence to some other program.&P;  Likewise, there's no easy way
as yet to model and then execute interaction among objects on the screen.&O;
The objects move in response to Mannequin's directions -- only.&M;

Morgan plans to change all this for the second release.&P;  The obstacle to true
object-orientation in the first release, he says, is performance.&P;  The
solution will be a total rewrite with tighter code, including the facilities
of VROOMM (Virtual Real-time Object-Oriented Memory Manager; see Release 1.0,
89-6) within Borland's C++.&P;  In the next release, Mannequins will be
standalone, independent objects that carry their code with them, rather than
data files that come with an application.&M;

In release 2, instead of selecting from a menu of body types as in release 1,
you'll be able to fill in a spreadsheet to create custom people.&P;  In the long
run, this will further the trend from mass production back to custom
production, where an individual's parameters can be fed back into a design
tool that drives a manufacturing system.&P;  But don't dismiss your tailor yet!&O;

LonWorks distributed intelligence system)&M;

ECHELON:  INTELLIGENCE FOR THE REST OF US (MACHINES) Echelon's new LonWorks
is not being pitched as an object-oriented system (it has other marketing
issues to content with).&P;  But distributed control and modularity -- i.e.,&O;
object orientation -- are fundamental characteristics of LonWorks, announced
earlier this month after a long gestation.&P;  (LON stands for Local Operating
Network.)&P;  In essence, LonWorks lets manufacturers or users turn a variety of
home, office of factory devices into smart objects, and provides an
object-oriented toolkit (LonBuilder) to program them.&M;

LonWorks is not just a product, but a concept that drags along a whole new
way of looking at things.&P;  Or call it tools, products and standards for a new
infrastructure.&P;  The concept is distributed intelligence, with microprocessor
nodes (Neuron chips) built into a variety of household, office and factory
machines.&P;  The Neuron nodes collect, send and respond to data, communicating
as necessary over a variety of media using a common network protocol,
LonTalk.&P;  Echelon will make its money from royalties paid by chip-builders
and OEMs who build the nodes, from Echelon's own transceivers to connect the
nodes to different media, and also from LonBuilder, a PC-based development
system used to program the microprocessors.&P;  Obviously, Echelon stands to win
if it can create a big, standard pie; by sharing the pie, it is hoping to
gain support from such vendors as Motorola and Toshiba, two early licensees
for the chip design.&M;

Echelon was founded in February 1988 by Mike Markkula, a key figure in Apple
Computer's early history.&P;  (Contrast Echelon's approach with Apple's
keep-it-all strategy, which may have outlived its time.)&P;  Later that year, he
recruited Ken Oshman, a co-founder of Rolm, and together the two managed to
raise $25 million on top of an earlier $5 million to bring the concept to
market.&P;  In addition, there's an undisclosed amount of prepaid royalties and
license fees from Motorola and Toshiba and others, for a total investment of
roughly $50 million.&M;

Just-enough intelligence&M;

We consider the concept to be a no-brainer:  Houses, factories, office
buildings and the like should be automated from the ground up, with small
amounts of local intelligence all over, rather than with a single control
station trying to manage everything from a central, remote location.&M;

This approach specifically does not mean personal computers all over the
place, but rather small, just-enough microprocessors capable of handling just
a few inputs and making a few decisions.&P;  If pcs were an improvement over
minis and mainframes and created a larger market, something even smaller and
cheaper (under $10) should be better and ultimately even more widespread.&O;
After all, you don't need a pc to control a light switch.&P;  You just need
something that can sense current light conditions, occupancy and time, and
take the appropriate action.&P;  On the other hand, with Lonworks you can avoid
collecting redundant information for several different systems.&P;  The
occupancy sensor's message could also trigger an alarm system.&P;  That alarm
system could be turned off and on by other messages, from a guard's station,
say.&P;  To the security guard, the front-end could be a pc with a menu
selection: "Secure building, locations..."&P;  The application would send
messages through its Neuron node to the appropriate LonWorks alarm nodes,
using individual or group IDs.&M;

So yes, there is a way of addressing locations from a central point, but most
of the activity goes on locally.&P;  More fundamentally, each location considers
itself the center of the universe, reacting to inputs and responding to
outputs according to its own program, not at the command of some host
somewhere.&P;  (1)  The system builder's and the ultimate buyer's purchase
decision are also "local," in the sense that they commit only a few dollars
extra -- $5 per unit wholesale is Echelon's near-term goal.&M;

LonWorks comprises four key elements:&M;

* the LonTalk protocol, a seven-layer communications protocol open to use by
anyone (with payment of royalties) and implemented on Neuron chips;&M;

* Neuron chips, comprising logic and I/O on three separate processors, plus
associated memory, made and sold by Motorola and Toshiba, with royalties to
Echelon (a European source is likely);&M;

* LonWorks transceivers, which connect Neuron chips to standard
communications media, available directly from Echelon; and&M;

* LonBuilder, DOS-based, object-oriented development software to program
individual Neurons and design LonWorks systems, with two LonBuilder Neuron
emulators (so they can talk to each other), for $14,965.&M;

Each LonWorks node consists of a Neuron chip and a sensor or actuator or
both.&P;  The sensor could be a thermostat, the actuator a light switch -- i.e.,&O;
the devices that are being made "intelligent" by the Neuron chip.&P;  The Neuron
node can also connect its device through an Echelon transceiver to other
nodes (and their devices) over a variety of media (twisted pair, coax, power
lines or radio frequencies, whatever).&M;

The Neuron's input unit interprets messages both from local sensors and from
remote devices (such as the security guard's workstation).&P;  The logic unit
(with its memory) performs simple tasks and calculations, responding to the
inputs as it is programmed to.&P;  And finally, the output unit sends messages
to local actuator devices, such as a light switch, a VCR or an automated
scrubber on an assembly line, or to remote nodes, such as the guard's
workstation, a distant water supply, another node that may also take action,
or even to a personal computer equipped with a Neuron.&P;  Such a pc could
maintain a database of system information, perform complex calculations or
(attempt to) maintain more central control than the pure Echelon approach
envisions.&P;  For example, you could control or repropgram the devices in your
house through a pc with LonBuilder-designed applications.&M;

We see a large market not only for little chips, but for software development
tools and LonBuilder applications that can be further customized by VARs or
users.&P;  As with object-oriented programming in general, LonBuilder
programmers will have to learn to program for distributed control -- but that
doesn't mean lack of intelligence.&P;  It's just that the intelligence is the
result of all these locally applied rules and procedures.&M;

Act locally and the globe will take care of itself&M;

The Echelon system is designed to be minimal; the messages to be sent across
the wires are short and quick, and the local intelligence is usually minimal
too.&P;  In short, while the programming of each node is fairly simple, the
whole system can be arbitrarily complex -- and seemingly intelligent.&P;  (See
Release 1.0, 89-6, on self-organizing systems.)&M;

Each individual chip is fairly simple to program; the interconnections are
where it gets complicated.&P;  The logic is independent of the network, and both
are independent of the sensors and actuators, which simply send and received
interpreted signals through the Neuron nodes, using Echelon's 50-odd defined
"standard network variable types" (SNVTs) or their own custom SNVTs.&P;  SNVTs
are implemented as IDs followed by a parameter, to communicate things such as
event count, temperature, light, percentage of [whatever you care to
measure], text strings, phone state (on, off-hook, busy, ringing, connected,
etc.), pressure, flow, voltage, etc.&P;  System-builders or third parties can
also define their own SNVTs; they just need to have nodes both to send them
and interpret them, and logic to act appropriately.&M;

In expert system terms, the individual nodes are generally brittle; they
wouldn't know how to interpret (let alone handle) the unexpected.&P;  Each is
designed to interpret a small number of inputs: temperature, a beam from an
infrared device, a message or two from the master bedroom.&P;  The smarts lies
in the overall structure of the system.&P;  How much of it is in the
programmer's mind, how much in the development tools or a central control
system?&M;

The last centralized decision&M;

Interestingly, for intelligence to be decentralized, certain technical
decisions -- for protocols, programming conventions and real-world
measurements -- must be centralized.&P;  Getting the world to make these
decisions in its favor is Echelon's marketing challenge.&P;  (At least Echelon
doesn't have the drawback of looking like a large, nasty monopolist -- yet.)&M;

The difference here is that commercial decisions can be decentralized too,
once the standards decision is made.&P;  One company need not provide
everything; you can be a specialist in light dimmers, or energy management,
or VCR programming, without having to provide the other services.&P;  Other
vendors can provide complementary components, or software to make better use
of them.&P;  Likewise, a customer can buy only the modules he needs (or can
afford) at any particular time.&P;  He needn't buy a wired house all at one time
(although it's a little cheaper).&P;  Most of the equipment can be added
incrementally, with connections through existing electrical circuits or phone
lines.&P;  (Since each unit has its own unique ID and knows what SNVTs it can
interpret, there's no great difficulty in attaching new nodes.)&M;

Accordingly, right from the start Echelon has been open, not just passively,
but aggressively.&P;  It has gone out and found two second sources to build the
chips (Neurons), and is inviting others to join.&P;  It is working with a
variety of manufacturers to get them to incorporate Neurons into their
products.&M;

The sign-ups so far are impressive, but not yet critical-mass: Sony, AMP,
Inc., Johnson Controls, Allen-Bradley and Steelcase are the best-known; other
include Leviton, a major wiring maker, and Lithonia Lighting.&P;  IBM, AT&amp;T and
Kodak have offered bland public blessings, but have made no firm commitments
so far.&P;  Perhaps the biggest win is getting Motorola and Toshiba to make the
chips; those companies, of course, will spend significant resources on
signing up customers.&M;

De facto versus de vapor&M;

Right now the competition is fragmented; it consists of a variety of
centrally controlled systems or small-scale would-be standards that work well
for a particular environment or market, but aren't generalizable or reusable
outside their own domains or markets.&P;  Figuratively, they're proprietary
mainframe systems; Echelon wants to introduce a pc -- with all that this
implies for broad licensing and ceding control to customers and third
parties.&P;  One example is the Smart House built by the National Association of
Home Builders, which is more of a demonstration than a commercial product or
specs for one.&M;

The most important potential competition (but for the home market only) is
the Electronic Industries Association's CEBus standard, still in committee,
which would offer roughly equivalent functionality to the Echelon protocols,
but little else -- i.e., no implementations, no development tools, and no
standard for authentication (CEBus assumes it's part of an individual
application, while Echelon implements it at the transport level -- level 4,
for you aficionados).&P;  Certainly these are likely to appear from a variety of
sources once the standard is ratified.&P;  For better or worse, the standard is
more concrete in the sense that it has particular appliances and the home
market in mind -- but less flexible and less extensible to other markets for
the same reason.&M;

What Echelon brings to the party is simply a standard -- with
industrial-strength, off-the-shelf implementations.&P;  Echelon wants LonWorks
to be a commodity -- so neutral and broad it addresses all markets.&P;  In fact,
anything that can interpret and send SNVTs is perfectly able to play.&P;  The
Neuron Chips are simply devices to translate those messages into the formats
required by the various physical devices; in essence, to give them all a
standard interface.&M;

Yes, there are lots of alternatives, but none of them has the dedication to
standards and to breadth that Echelon has.&P;  This is one of those cases where
spending upfront enhances the product itself.&P;  Yes, it's what AT&amp;T or
Motorola or any of the large firms should have done themselves, but it wasn't
in their natura.&P;  At least some of them seem to have seen the wisdom of this
approach -- and are willing to adopt it since Echelon doesn't look like a
threat to anyone.&M;

At Rolm too, says Echelon's Keith Raffel, "We were trying to change an
entrenched way of doing things, fighting centralized, electromechanical
systems in favor of local, computerized PBXes."&P;  Raffel is one of 20 former
ROLM employees on Echelon's staff of 70.&P;  Rolm actually got into business
building standard rugged computers for the military at a time when the
military was buying mostly custom systems.&P;  Later on, it applied the same
minicomputer technology to PBXes, replacing mechanical switches with
electronics.&P;  Funny how history repeats itself.&P;  On the other hand, we doubt
that Echelon will sell out to a monolith while Oshman's still around.&O;
Another obvious, if no complete, parallel is the role 3Com played for
Ethernet....&M;

(1) Of course, this raises the fundamental philosophical question: Does an
Echelon Neuron have free will?&O;

PLATFORMS FOR COMPUTING FORUM The Fourteenth Annual PC (Platforms for
Computing) Forum will take place in Tucson from March 10 to 13 -- two months
later (and warmers!) than last year.&P;  The theme will be "Beyond the desktop:
Networks, notepads and legacies."&P;  As a subscriber, you should have received
your registration materials already.&P;  (If you aren't a subscriber and would
like to attend, please contact us.&P;  We would be glad to sign you up for both
the newsletter and the Forum.&P;  If someone else in your company -- not your PR
agency or your investor! -- is a subscriber, you may be able to register
through that subscription; two registrants per subscription.)&M;

As it happens, each of the title items actually refers to a particular
product on the one hand, and a topic area on the other.&P;  Networks is Lotus
Notes, or information management.&P;  Legacies is Sybase Open Server for CICS,
or application development and interoperability, and how to achieve them with
object-oriented approaches.&P;  Notepads is GO, or new operating environments.&O;
Our goal is to provide more focus than in previous years by framing the
discussion each day around a single product -- with ample input from
competing products and alternative approaches, both from competitors and from
resellers and users, who give the ultimate verdict.&M;

But rather than a series of speeches about, say, "information management" on
Monday, we'll have a centered discussion, a sort of compare-and-contrast that
should provoke concrete, lively discussion.&P;  Products/approaches considered
will include e-mail filters, Reach/Coopers &amp; Lybrand's Knowledge Network, and
the American Information Exchange.&M;

On Tuesday, we'll address "legacies" not just as data, but as the
applications and business rules and procedures that user companies want to
represent (and execute) in software.&P;  Who controls them?&P;  How can MIS and pc
users work together?&P;  Is it better to reverse-engineer, or to start over?&O;
Does it make sense simply to encapsulate mainframe applications (the Sybase
Open Server for CICS approach; Release 1.0, 90-9), or to rebuild from
scratch?&P;  What's the relation between servers and objects (see page 5)?&P;  Is
object-oriented programming a solution to software complexity, or another
cause of it?&P;  For vendors attempting to sell to large customers, these are
key questions -- akin to the current fascination with providing connectivity
between spreadsheets and mainframe databases, but on a broader, more
technically challenging scale.&P;  Products and approaches will include
object-oriented programming, reverse-engineering tools, and a new
transaction-oriented development tool.&M;

Finally, on Wednesday we'll discuss notepads.&P;  But just as networks are
important not only as hardware but as a medium for information-sharing, so
are notepads important not only as mobile computers but as the medium for a
new approach to computing.&P;  They promise the possible emergence of a new
operating environment not just for notepads but ultimately for the desktop;
contenders include GO and Active Book, with desktop competition from Patriot
Partners, NeXT and others.&M;

Featured speeches will include Wang's Steve Levine on visualization of
qualitative data such as text, priorities, workflows, data structures and
program sequences; Ken Oshman on "Wiring the world from the bottom up;" and
Intel's Andy Grove on "Power in platforms -- what for?"&P;  In addition,
"Bionomics" author Michael Rothschild will provide a new perspective on
competition and economic evolution.&M;

Please plan to stay all three days, through the discussion of notepads and
new operating environments on Wednesday.&P;  The conference will end that day at
noon with a speech by Electronic Frontier Foundation co-founder (with Mitch
Kapor) and Grateful Dead lyricist John Perry Barlow, who will both close the
conference and kick off a limited-space tour of the Biosphere, the
experimental self-sufficient ecosystem.&O;

<TITLE>How to run a better bulletin board.&M;
</TITLE>
<DESCRIPT>
Topic:     Software Publishers
User Relations
Computer Bulletin Boards
Guidelines.&M;
</DESCRIPT>
<TEXT>

"The number one issue today," says Jim Fitzgerald, manager of technical
support for Borland's language products, "is getting information into the
hands of users." And one of the best ways to provide such information, he
argues, is through an electronic bulletin board system.&P;  Unlike "one-to-one"
phone support, he says, bulletin boards help users tap into knowledge that is
otherwise lost "on isolated hard drives, on sticky notes, and in the brains
of engineers."&M;

But setting up a bulletin board isn't as easy as it seems, Fitzgerald
concedes.&P;  To succeed, a bulletin board has to attract a critical mass of
enthusiastic users and "provide a comfortable environment for people to talk
to each other." We asked Fitzgerald for advice on how to create a successful
BBS:&M;

*  Emphasize support for advanced users: Bulletin boards typically&M;

attract high levels of message activity from users of technical&M;

products like languages, Fitzgerald points out.&P;  Borland gets&M;

roughly 1,000 telephone support calls a day for its database&M;

products and only 300-400 calls for language products, but both&M;

products generate the same level of BBS activity--1,000 messages&M;

per week.&P;  BBS users "want more than access to sophisticated&M;

engineers--they want to get in touch with people who understand&M;

business applications as well."&M;

*  Stay involved: One benefit of a bulletin board is that it&M;

reduces a company's overall tech support burden.&P;  Fitzgerald says&M;

Borland only has to answer 5%-10% of the questions that users&M;

post on the BBS.&P;  But Borland technicians regularly monitor all&M;

messages for accuracy and completeness.&P;  "To set up a bulletin&M;

board and then not be there will doom it to failure," he says.&M;

Almost every engineer in our language group participates on a&M;

bulletin board in some way."&M;

*  Reward active users: "People really enjoy sharing their&M;

knowledge," Fitzgerald says, but Borland also tries to reward&M;

expert BBS users who provide the most generous on-line help.&M;

These users become part of a "Team Borland" group that receives&M;

free software, access to beta versions, and occasional&M;

reimbursement for connect charges.&P;  Borland also flies Team&M;

Borland members out to California every year for a party and&M;

meeting.&P;  "Whatever we do for them, it's almost not enough.&M;

They're the people who make it all happen."&M;

*  Have a public presence: Even though Borland generates more than&M;

enough message traffic to justify operating its own in-house BBS&M;

system, Fitzgerald says the company prefers to operate bulletin&M;

boards through services like CompuServe and Genie, because these&M;

services attract high-volume message traffic.&P;  CompuServe is a&M;

particularly good BBS environment: "The depth of knowledge there&M;

is far greater than on any bulletin board I've seen.&P;  If I had my&M;

way, I'd like the whole planet on CompuServe." (Borland does&M;

operate an in-house BBS, but users rely on it chiefly for&M;

downloading and uploading files, Fitzgerald notes.)&M;

*  Don't censor your message traffic: "You can't even allow the&M;

perception that you censor anyone's messages," says Fitzgerald.&M;

When customers post lists of bugs in Borland products, for&M;

example, Borland may attach explanations and comments, but&M;

doesn't try to remove the lists.&P;  People love it when you're&M;

forthright and honest."&M;

<TEXT>

It wasn't a cheerful way to wrap up the year.&P;  On December 11, a federal
judge threw out Ashton-Tate's suit against Fox Software and trashed the
company's dbase copyrights, accusing Tate of "repeatedly" and "knowingly"
concealing that the dbase product line was derived from a mainframe language
called JPLDIS.&P;  Wall Street promptly reacted by chopping $36 million (18% of
the company's total worth) off the value of Ashton-Tate's stock.&P;  And a week
later, the mail brought a class action suit alleging that, because Tate's
copyrights were flawed, dBase buyers are now entitled to hefty refunds.&M;

All this sound and fury makes great courtroom drama, of course, but does it
transform the legal landscape for anyone besides Ashton-Tate? Probably not.&O;
The important issue in the Fox case was whether AshtonTate was entitled to
copyright a computer language and file format.&P;  Judge Hatter's one-page
decision doesn't even pretend to explore this thorny question, so his order
has virtually no impact on the ongoing debate over intellectual property
rights.&P;  In fact, Ashton-Tate's dBase rivals already assumed--probably
correctly--that they were free to create their own implementations of the
dbase language; dbase customers are unlikely to take the judge's decision as
a license to start pumping out thousands of pirate copies of dBase III+ and
IV.&M;

Meanwhile, Ashton-Tate's lawyers are trying to pick up the pieces.&P;  with any
luck, they'll find a higher court to reverse judge Hatter's order-- or, worst
case, they'll convince the Copyright Office to overrule the judge.&P;  But
what's really at stake is Ashton-Tate's credibility.&P;  Bill Lyons and the rest
of the company's new management have done a remarkable job of rebuilding the
company they took over from the Esber gang.&P;  Now, they've got fresh egg on
their faces.&M;

In retrospect, it's clear that Lyons should have scuttled the Fox lawsuit the
first week he took over Ed Esber's job.&P;  That action would have given
Ashton-Tate a graceful and generous exit from a scene that even company
insiders thought was an embarrassment.&P;  Instead, Ashton-Tate has now learned
a painful lesson: No matter how much muscle you bring into a courtroom, the
judge is always the ultimate tough guy.&O;

</DESCRIPT>
<TEXT>

Several years ago, we took a look at R&amp;D spending patterns in the software
industry and discovered that it was fairly typical for companies to spend
8%-12% of their revenues on R&amp;D activities, regardless of size,
profitability, or market segment (Soft*letter, 6/11/87).&P;  We recently decided
to take a fresh look at that benchmark, to see if spending levels have
changed over the past three years.&M;

Certainly there have been major changes in the R&amp;D environment.&P;  Most
companies now develop for multiple platforms and operating systems, graphical
interfaces have added a new layer of design complexity, and compatibility and
QA standards continue to rise.&P;  At the same time, most software companies
generate much greater revenues than they did three years ago.&P;  Even if R&amp;D
percentage levels don't change, actual budgets are now likely to be more
generous.&M;

To gauge the effect of these changes, we analyzed three-year R&amp;D spending
trends for a sample of 14 public software companies.&P;  Although these
companies aren't entirely representative of the software industry as a whole,
they do tend to classify R&amp;D costs more rigorously than small companies do.&O;
(For consistency, we excluded other public companies from the sample that
capitalized more than a nominal portion of their R&amp;D spending.)&M;

The results of this comparison suggest that R&amp;D spending levels in fact have
been rising steadily: Over the past two years, average R&amp;D spending for our
sample of 14 companies has moved from 12.5% of sales to 14.1%--a 12.8%
increase.&P;  Measured in absolute dollars, the increase is even more dramatic:
Total R&amp;D spending for our sample has more than doubled, from $215 million
three years ago to $453 million last year.&M;

When we look at specific companies on the chart, a few interesting points
emerge.&P;  The most R&amp;D-intensive company is clearly Timberline Software, a
developer of vertical market products for the construction industry (1989
sales: $10.7 million).&P;  In general, however, the top R&amp;D spenders tend to be
large publishers of general purpose productivity software--Ashton-Tate,
Symantec, Lotus, SPC, Borland, and Microsoft--who face the most aggressive
marketplace competition.&M;

At the low end of the chart, the patterns are harder to define.&P;  But our
sense is that below-average R&amp;D levels may be characteristic of companies
that face less urgent competitive pressures--that is, consumer software
companies and established market leaders like Autodesk and Aldus.&M;

But perhaps the most obvious influence on R&amp;D spending is simple history:
Companies tend to maintain roughly the same percentage level of R&amp;D spending
as they spent in previous years.&P;  If there's any lesson here, it's that R&amp;D
spending is driven more by internal budget processes than by external
competition, sales fluctuations, or new technologies.&O;

"All too often," says financial consultant Mike Gonnerman,  "small company
chief executives are eager to delegate responsibility for financial
management because the subject doesn't interest them as much as marketing or
product development or people management." But small companies rarely hire
sophisticated financial managers, he points out, and they often quickly
outgrow "fairly primitive" reporting systems that were designed for start-up
operations.&P;  "So, like it or not, the buck ends up back on the boss's desk."&M;

But how does a chief executive measure his own financial savvy (and the
adequacy of his company's internal systems)? Gonnerman, a CPA who has spent
the last twelve years as a CFO and advisor to high tech companies, has put
together a "financial IQ" test that covers 13 topics--including the following
six points--that he believes every chief executive should be able to answer
with confidence:&M;

*  What's my monthly "nut?" "This can be a tricky question unless a&M;

company's operations are very stable," says Gonnerman.&P;  "Ideally,&M;

the `nut' consists of those basic operating costs that would&M;

have to be paid even if the company had no sales at all--rent,&M;

salaries, insurance, utilities, and the like.&P;  This is a useful&M;

figure to know when calculating monthly cash flow, but in a&M;

growing (or shrinking) company it's a good idea to assume that&M;

the `nut' is not a fixed amount."&M;

*  How much does each of my products contribute to profits?&M;

Gonnerman points out that a good financial reporting system&M;

should allocate costs--including overhead, capital expenses, and&M;

indirect labor--to each major product or service a company&M;

sells.&P;  "When you look at these numbers carefully, you may find&M;

products that don't really contribute to the bottom line, even&M;

though gross revenues look good."&M;

*  How much inventory do I really have? "Many companies use a so-called&M;

`four-wall' inventory accounting technique, where&M;

inventory levels are figured by adding and subtracting what goes&M;

in and out of inventory," says Gonnerman.&P;  But over time, errors&M;

tend to accumulate that leave inventory reports "seriously out&M;

of whack." A better approach: Set up a cycle count program,&M;

which provides for frequent physical counts of inventory--&M;

especially of "high dollar-value items" and "items that have&M;

long lead times for ordering."&M;

*  How long should it take to close out the books every month?&M;

"Even without computers, banks were always able to close their&M;

books every  day, and some very large corporations manage to&M;

collect all  the data they need in less than a week," Gonnerman&M;

points out.&P;  "The secret is to close out subledger systems&M;

(inventory,  receivables, and payables) on a daily basis.&P;  When&M;

you're this  organized, your accountant won't need the `normal'&M;

ten days he  or she is probably taking now."&M;

*  What expenses will I have in the next three or four months?&M;

"This is a problem for many small, fast-growing companies," says&M;

Gonnerman.&P;  Budgets, especially for development and marketing&M;

departments, tend to be unreliable for capturing ongoing changes&M;

in commitments." A better way to forecast costs: Issue (and&M;

track) formal purchase orders for every major cost item.&P;  "A&M;

purchase order system should enable the company to account for&M;

all commitments that are outstanding, and should allow for easy&M;

classification by amount, vendor, department, and delivery&M;

time."&M;

*  What are the right categories for analyzing my costs?&P;  If your&M;

financial statements seem to lump together low-priced apples and&M;

high-priced oranges, the chances are that important changes will&M;

be hard to spot.&P;  Go back to basics and develop a good, detailed&M;

chart of accounts that assigns expenses to their natural&M;

categories, and that further breaks down these classifications&M;

by department.&P;  Your accountant will probably complain that&M;

reclassifying costs will make it harder to compare present&M;

performance with previous financial statements.&P;  Your accountant&M;

is right, but your historical records aren't worth much anyway&M;

if they're broken down into meaningless classifications."&M;

<ABSTRACT>Some computer industry experts believe that there is a need for a
standard for modular microcomputer-based instruments and data
acquisition systems, but others believe that such a standard is
unnecessary.&P;  Rapid Systems Pres Tom Bardeen has proposed a
standard, PCXI, which would address the issues of noise, power,
and cooling of microcomputer-based instruments.&P;  National
Instruments' customers rarely complain about issues related to
noise, power, and cooling, but Data Acquisition Product Mgr
Richard House believes that there is a need for standards related
to address levels, interrupt levels, and DMA levels.&P;  MetraByte

C&amp;T Enters Processor Market With "PUMA"&M;

Chips and Technologies has introduced a "Programmable Universal Micro
Accelerator" (PUMA) chip set that is designed to serve as a graphics
accelerator in systems using the AT or EISA bus.&P;  The chip set consists of
two devices: the PUMA-P processor and the PUMA-I interface chip.&P;  The
processor executes microcode from a writable control store (RAM), so its
function is fully programmable.&P;  PUMA-I also includes a laser printer
interface that can directly drive a Canon SX engine.&M;

In principle, PUMA can be used to accelerate any application that includes
compute-intensive tasks.&P;  Chips and Technologies will initially provide
microcode for accelerating AutoCAD and Windows 3.&P;  An AutoCAD accelerator
card using the PUMA chip set was announced at Comdex by Cardinal Technologies
(Lancaster, PA).&P;  PUMA cards are expected to sell for approximately $500.&M;

PUMA serves as both a display and printing accelerator.&P;  C&amp;T is positioning
the product primarily as a display accelerator for AutoCAD, speeding up zoom,
pan, and redraw functions, and as a printing accelerator for Windows,
although it can accelerate both functions in both applications.&P;  C&amp;T claims
that its preliminary version of PUMA is over three times faster than the
fastest AutoCAD accelerator available, and more than 25 times faster than an
unaccelerated VGA display using the standard AutoCAD driver on a 33-MHz 386
system.&P;  Even display controllers with line-drawing engines, such as 8514/A,
are significantly sped up by PUMA.&P;  This is because most AutoCAD drawings
consist of short vectors, and the time to perform the transformation,
clipping, and setup overwhelms the line drawing time.&M;

When used with AutoCAD, printing is implemented via the "print screen" key,
and whatever portion of the drawing is displayed is sent to the printer; the
normal AutoCAD print function is not used.&P;  The drawing is printed using the
same display list as used for the screen, which is re-rendered at 300 dpi for
the printer--a process that PUMA performs in two to five seconds.&P;  With
Windows, printing is controlled via the usual dialog boxes.&M;

The AutoCAD driver is implemented entirely in PUMA code, and therefore
provides the same performance regardless of the speed of the system in which
it is installed.&P;  The Windows driver uses both host processor and PUMA code,
so the degree of acceleration is not as great.&P;  C&amp;T claims a three-to-ten
times performance gain for complex graphics displays under Windows.&M;

Unlike other display accelerators, which are typically implemented as part of
a display card, PUMA is designed to operate independently of the frame
buffer.&P;  It can, in principle, work with any display card, writing to the
display card's frame buffer via the system bus.&P;  The initial release of the
PUMA microcode will support 640 X 480 VGA, 800 X 600 VGA (which has been
standardized by the Video Electronics Standards Association), and several
popular 1024 X 768 super-VGA cards.&P;  The AutoCAD driver will also support
8514/A, including extended resolutions up to 1600 X 1200 using C&amp;T's
8514/A-compatible controller.&M;

PUMA is not intended to be user-programmed, or even developer-programmed.&O;
C&amp;T does not plan to provide microcode development tools; all microcode will
be supplied by C&amp;T.&P;  This avoids the usual barriers with introducing a new
architecture; the PUMA architecture is transparent to everyone except C&amp;T's
programmers.&P;  C&amp;T concedes that developing microcode for PUMA is difficult,
but claims that performance is well beyond what could be achieved with a
conventional RISC processor and the cost is lower.&P;  Because of the high
volume of the PC market, C&amp;T can justify a significant investment in
microcode development.&M;

The microcode will be provided with the chips for a "nominal" charge, if any.&O;
PUMA add-in cards will be sold with driver disks that include both software
that runs on the host processor (typically a 286, 386, or 486) and microcode
that is downloaded to the PUMA-P processor.&P;  Compute-intensive tasks are
performed by the PUMA-P microcode, working in concert with driver software
executing by the host processor.&P;  In the case of AutoCAD, the driver
interprets the display list.&P;  For Windows, the driver interprets GDI
(Graphics Device Interface) commands.&P;  Both the display and the printer are
controlled by the same GDI commands, and images for both are rendered by the
same interpreter, with only the resolution differing.&P;  Thus, displayed and
printed images should match exactly.&M;

Processor Architecture&M;

Figure 1 shows a block diagram of an AT-bus (ISA) PUMA add-in card.&P;  An 8K X
64 SRAM bank (expandable to 16K X 64) stores the microcode, and an 8K X 16
SRAM bank (expandable to 16K X 16) provides temporary data storage.&P;  The
SRAMs must have an access time of 25 ns or less.&P;  Large amounts of data, such
as display lists and bit maps for printing, are stored in the main system
memory.&P;  The PUMA-I interface chip provides a bus-master interface to the AT
or EISA bus.&P;  The PUMA-P chip includes approximately 17,000 gates, and PUMA-I
includes approximately 14,000 gates.&P;  Both are packaged in 160-pin plastic
flat packs.&M;

No program ROM is required.&P;  To start the PUMA processor, a microcode
boot-loader is written to the PUMA-I chip via the system bus.&P;  PUMA-I
transfers the boot loader into the microcode memory via a serial interface
(SDIP and SDPI are the data lines, SA is an address line, and SE is the
serial enable).&P;  Once the boot loader is transferred, PUMA-P loads the bulk
of the microcode by operating as a bus master to load the program from the
system memory.&P;  A 1K-word (8K-byte) instruction block can be loaded in less
than 1 ms.&P;  Large microcode programs can use overlays.&M;

The PUMA-P processor includes:&M;

* 16-bit ALU&M;

* 16 X 16 register file&M;

* 16 X 16 multiplier with 32-bit result&M;

* Barrel shifter/byte swapper&M;

* 2911-type microprogram sequencer with 9-level stack&M;

* Three loop/address counters&M;

* Interface ports&M;

The processor operates from a 50-MHz clock, and instructions execute in two
to five clock cycles.&P;  Logical and sequencer operations require two clock
cycles; arithmetic operations require three; and multiply requires five.&P;  The
instruction encoding includes a two-bit field that specifies the number of
clock cycles the instruction requires.&P;  A multiply instruction can be set to
use fewer than five clock cycles if the following instruction does not use
the result of the multiplication.&P;  The processor has a two-stage pipeline,
and an instruction can optionally cause the first stage to be flushed.&M;

The normal instruction format, shown in Table 1, uses 64 bits for each
instruction.&P;  An optional 32-bit compressed format increases program density
at the expense of execution speed.&P;  If the 32-bit format is used, two
instructions are packed into each 64-bit word.&P;  The processor expands each
instruction to the 64-bit format before executing it.&P;  Both formats can be
used within a single microprogram.&P;  The 32-bit format does not provide access
to all of the processor's parallelism and has a three-clock minimum
instruction time.&P;  The current driver software from C&amp;T uses the 64-bit
format.&M;

ALU functions include add, subtract, AND, OR, XOR, and XNOR.&P;  Subtract can
use the operands in either order, and the AND operation can optionally
complement one of the operands, for a total of eight possible operations.&M;

The 5-bit "PCP" (Processor Control Point) field can specify any of a variety
of operations to be performed, including incrementing or decrementing a loop
counter, capturing information from the host bus, and initiating a microcode
memory write cycle.&M;

The sequencer is similar to the 2911 bit-slice microcode sequencer.&P;  The
microcode program counter is normally incremented after each instruction, but
it can also be loaded from the ALU output, the immediate data field, or the
on-chip 9-level stack.&P;  A variety of conditions can be tested for conditional
jumps.&M;

PUMA-I Interface&M;

The PUMA-I chip provides the interface between PUMA-P and the system bus.&O;
There are three data paths between PUMA-P and the host processor:&M;

* Bus-master data channel&M;

* Processor communication data channel&M;

* Serial data channel&M;

The bus-master data channel allows the PUMA chip set to directly access all
system resources by becoming the master of the system bus.&P;  This mode is used
for accessing display lists, printer bit maps, and other information in
system memory, as well as for writing to a display controller on the system
board or another add-in card.&P;  The PUMA-I chip supports both the AT (ISA) and
EISA buses, but does not support the 32-bit EISA data path.&P;  (The interface
chip used in boards that C&amp;T has demonstrated is called PUMA-AT; it supports
only the AT bus and will not be marketed.&P;  It is being enhanced to support
EISA and to include FIFO buffers, and has been renamed PUMA-I.)&M;

The PUMA-P chip is relatively bus independent, and future versions of the
interface chip may support the Micro Channel.&P;  A 32-bit data path would
require modifications to both chips, as well as larger packages to
accommodate the higher pin count required.&P;  C&amp;T claims that most display and
printer functions are compute-bound, rather than bandwidth-limited, so the
16-bit data bus is not a limitation.&M;

PUMA-I includes a 16-word write FIFO and a 4-word read FIFO.&P;  To write data
to the system bus, PUMA-P writes the address and data to the write FIFO in
PUMA-I.&P;  PUMA-I then acquires control of the bus and performs the transfer.&O;
To read data from the system bus, PUMA-P writes a read request to PUMA-I, and
PUMA-I acquires the bus and reads the data from the bus to the read FIFO.&O;
The read FIFO can be set to a read-ahead mode, in which it fills the FIFO
with successive locations as it is emptied by PUMA-P.&P;  Reads are given
priority over writes.&P;  As long as there is any data in the write FIFO or any
read requests pending, PUMA-I retains control of the system bus (except when
it must relinquish it for the host processor to perform an access, as
described below).&M;

Bus-master operation on the EISA bus is well-defined, and PUMA-I supports the
standard EISA arbitration functions.&P;  The AT bus was not well-designed for
bus-master peripherals, however, and PUMA-I provides several functions to aid
in smooth bus-master operation.&P;  PUMA-I monitors the system bus when it is
not the bus master to observe when the host processor performs refresh
cycles, and sets its internal refresh counter to match host processor's
refresh interval.&P;  When PUMA-I is the bus master, it relinquishes the bus
when its refresh timer indicates that the host processor is about to perform
a refresh cycle.&P;  PUMA-I reacquires the bus after a programmable interval.&O;
This interval guarantees that some bus bandwidth is available to the host
processor even if PUMA-I has a long series of operations to perform.&M;

The processor communication data channel uses eight registers in PUMA-I that
are mapped in the host processor's I/O address space.&P;  PUMA-I defaults to an
I/O base address of 240H, but this address can be modified by driving six of
the data pins when RESET is asserted.&P;  The host processor writes a command
code to the PUMA-I command register.&P;  PUMA-P polls a status register in
PUMA-I to detect when a command has arrived, and it then reads the parameters
directly from system memory.&P;  The host processor polls a status register in
PUMA-I (which is written by PUMA-P) to determine when the command is
complete, and it can then retrieve a result code.&M;

The serial data channel allows information to be sent from PUMA-I to PUMA-P
independently of microcode execution.&P;  (For parallel data transfers between
PUMA-P and PUMA-I, PUMA-P must act as the master under microcode control.)&O;
Serial transfers are used primarily to load the microcode boot loader.&P;  The
serial data channel is also used for debugging, and allows microcode to be
single-stepped.&M;

Printer Interface&M;

PUMA-I provides a serial interface that can drive the video inputs of a Canon
SX laser printer engine.&P;  PUMA-P writes a word containing 16 pixel values to
the LZBUF (laser buffer) register in PUMA-I.&P;  An 8-word FIFO stores the data
written to LZBUF.&M;

PUMA-I waits for the printer engine to assert the BD-(beam detect) signal,
indicating the start of a scan line.&P;  It then waits for a programmed delay
that determines the width of the margin, and begins shifting out the data in
LZBUF.&P;  To provide the 1.8 Mbit/s data rate required by 300-dpi printers,
PUMA-P must write a new value to this register at least every 8.584
microseconds, on average, to prevent an underrun from occurring.&P;  The line
length counter is incremented until a preset value is reached.&P;  PUMA-I then
waits for BD-to be asserted again before shifting out additional data.&M;

C&amp;T claims that printing from Windows using PUMA is from six to more than
twenty times faster than using a standard HP LaserJet II.&P;  PUMA-P is able to
rotate from portrait to landscape mode on-the-fly, which is not possible with
host-based printer drivers.&P;  Because of the parallel capabilities of the PUMA
processor, the inner loop of the rotation routine requires only two
instructions.&M;

Conclusions&M;

PUMA is an innovative approach to accelerating PC applications.&P;  C&amp;T claims
that it will offer much better price/performance than accelerators based on
TI's 34010 and 34020 graphics processors.&P;  It also differs from such display
accelerators in that it works with existing display cards, instead of
replacing them.&M;

While the functions performed are different, PUMA is similar in concept to
Intel's DVI chip set: a dedicated processor executes downloaded microcode to
perform certain functions much more quickly than the host processor can.&P;  In
both cases, while the processor is programmable, most--if not all--software
is provided by the chip manufacturer.&M;

The major challenge facing Chips and Technologies in establishing PUMA is
providing the microcode needed to make it useful.&P;  C&amp;T's demonstrations at
Comdex were limited to AutoCAD displays; printing and Windows were not shown.&M;

One problem PUMA may face is the poorly-defined bus-master operation of the
AT bus.&P;  Vendors of bus-master cards for the AT bus have found that some
clone systems have problems with bus masters, and there may be conflicts with
some add-in cards as well.&P;  C&amp;T believes that its refresh timing approach
will eliminate conflicts, but the effectiveness of this solution won't be
known until a large number of PUMA boards are in the field.&P;  EISA systems
shouldn't have problems with bus-master operation, but the installed base of
EISA systems is relatively small.&M;

Windows 3 may be the best opportunity for PUMA, since it allows a single
driver to support a wide range of application programs and slow printing
times are a serious problem with Windows today.&P;  One problem, which has
limited acceptance of other printer accelerators such as those from
LaserMaster, is the inability to directly handle EPS (encapsulated
PostScript) graphics and output from PostScript-based drawing programs such
as Adobe Illustrator.&P;  Host-based PostScript interpreters are available that
would allow the PUMA driver to handle PostScript, but such programs tend to
be slow, negating PUMA's performance advantage.&M;

If PUMA is successful, C&amp;T will presumably develop microcode for other
applications.&P;  For example, a host-based PostScript-compatible interpreter
could be made much faster by off-loading compute-intensive parts of the
interpreter to PUMA.&P;  Other possible applications include data compression
and image processing.&P;  The limiting factor will be C&amp;T's ability to develop
the microcode, which is a slow and painful process.&O;

1990 Brings Few New Architectures&M;

In our first issue of 1990, we forecast that a period of architectural
stability was beginning, and that the focus would shift to implementations.&O;
For the most part, the new product introductions that have occurred in the
past 12 months support this view.&M;

The only new architecture introduced in 1990 for general-purpose systems is
IBM's RS/6000.&P;  IBM is probably the only company in the world that could have
successfully introduced a new architecture this year for this market.&P;  IBM's
tremendous resources give it the luxury of time in establishing a new
architecture, and IBM's marketing muscle gives it the power to attract the
attention of software developers and system buyers.&P;  Even so, the RS/6000
would not have received much attention if it were not for its outstanding
floating-point performance.&P;  Some of this performance comes from
architectural features, such as the multiply-accumulate instruction, while
some of it comes from implementation characteristics, such as the ability to
dispatch both a floating-point instruction and an integer instruction in the
same clock cycle.&M;

Other than the RS/6000, all the new processors introduced this year for
general-purpose systems are new implementations of existing architectures.&O;
Motorola's 68040 adds an on-chip floating-point unit and provides faster
execution, but implements essentially the same architecture as the 68030.&O;
AMD's 286ZX is identical to the 286 except for its on-chip peripheral
functions.&P;  Intel's 386SL is a 386-architecture processor, with minor
extensions for power management.&M;

Embedded processor introductions were also dominated by new implementations
of existing architectures.&P;  New processors without architectural changes
included:&M;

* IDT's R3051/3052 and LSI Logic's LR33000.&P;  Both use the standard MIPS
architecture.&M;

* LSI Logic's L64901, Cypress/ROSS's 7C611, and Fujitsu's 86902, all minor
modifications of existing SPARC implementations.&M;

* AMD's 29050, a faster implementation of the 29000 with an on-chip
floating-point unit.&M;

* Intel's 960SA and 960SB, cost-reduced versions of the 960KA and 960KB with
a 16-bit bus.&M;

* Intel's 960MM, which is being marketed only to select military customers.&M;

* Motorola's 68EC030, a 68030 without an MMU and with a lower price tag.&M;

* Motorola's 68331 and 68340, both using the same 68020-like CPU32 core
processor.&M;

* National's 32CG160, which adds on-chip peripherals to the 32CG16.&M;

Several new processors extended existing architectures to improve
performance.&P;  These include:&M;

* National's 32FX16 and 32GX320, which include DSP extensions to the 32000
architecture.&M;

* Fujitsu's 86930 "SPARClite," which adds multiply, divide step, and table
look-up instructions.&M;

* Motorola's 68HC16, which extends the 68HC11 architecture to 16 bits.&M;

* Motorola's 96002 DSP, which is similar to the 56001 but with a
floating-point data path.&M;

* AT&amp;T's DSP3210, which slightly extends the instruction set of the DSP32C.&M;

* TI's 340C40, a parallel-processing DSP that includes minor additions to the
340C30 architecture.&M;

A few entirely new architectures for embedded control were introduced.&P;  The
driving force for these architectures was to minimize transistor count while
providing the performance needed for specific applications.&P;  In most
instances, the vendors do not intend to compete in the broader embedded
processor marketplace.&P;  For example, Zilog licensed of the Hyperstone
architecture, but plans to use it primarily as a core processor in peripheral
chips.&P;  Philips-Signetics introduced its VLIW "LIFE" architecture, but plans
to offer it only as a custom product.&P;  Intel's DVI processor and C&amp;T's PUMA
processor are new architectures but are intended primarily to execute
software provided by the chip vendor.&P;  Echelon's "NEURON" chips are based on
a unique architecture, but are optimized for a very specific class of
applications.&P;  There were two new, general-purpose embedded families
introduced: NEC's K-series processors, and Siemens' 80C166.&M;

In 1991, the pattern is likely to be similar, with even fewer new
architectures.&P;  (We'll look at our expectations for 1991 in the next issue).&O;
The market is saturated, and the difficulties of introducing a new
architecture are enormous.&P;  Designers are tired of evaluating new
architectures, and a modest performance gain isn't enough to get their
attention.&P;  The opportunities for improving performance while reducing chip
count and system cost by adding more on-chip functions to existing
architectures are tremendous, and this is where most activity for the next
few years will be focused.&O;

Motorola Says 68040 Now Shipping--Really After a false start earlier this
fall, Motorola claims that volume shipments of the production version of the
68040 have begun.&P;  Motorola says that over 100 companies have received
samples and 36 companies have announced their intention to use the chip.&P;  Of
these, Apple is the most significant.&P;  HP/Apollo has been badly hurt by the
delays in shipping the 68040, which have made it difficult for HP to compete
against RISC-based workstations, notably Sun's SPARCstations.&P;  In the long
run, HP is likely to shift its workstation base to its Precision
Architecture.&P;  Other system companies mentioned by Motorola include NCR, even
though NCR has been promoting an all-Intel strategy; NeXT, whose ability to
sell significant numbers of systems remains unproven; and Unisys, which is in
deep trouble.&M;

Motorola's 68000-family marketing manager Jim Reinhart acknowledged that the
part still has some bugs, but said that all have simple workarounds and do
not affect compatibility.&P;  Approximately 1,000 to 1,500 parts were shipped in
November, and the company expects to ship about 10,000 in December and reach
a shipment rate of 5,000 units per week by the end of January.&P;  Current
production is claimed to meet all specifications, but it still carries the
prototype "XC" marking.&P;  Reinhart says that the switch to the "MC"
designation won't occur until the middle of 1991, when extensive reliability
testing is completed.&P;  The chip is priced at $595 in quantities of 1,000.&O;

Embedded 68040 Version Coming While it has not announced the product,
Motorola has distributed a "product preview" of the 68EC040, a variant of the
68040 designed for embedded control.&P;  Unlike the 68EC030, which is simply a
68030 with the MMU disabled, the 68EC040 is a different chip design than the
68040.&P;  It eliminates the floating-point unit and memory-management units,
and cuts the cache sizes in half from 4K to 2K bytes each for instructions
and data.&P;  It retains the full 32-bit, non-multiplexed address and data
buses.&P;  In essence, it is like a fast 68020 with larger caches.&P;  Motorola
rates the part at 16 MIPS at 20 MHz and 20 MIPS at 25 MHz.&O;

S3 Abandons Systems Logic Startup S3 has abandoned development of their PC
system logic chips that were introduced with much fanfare earlier this year
(see [mu]PR 5/18/90 p. 1).&P;  The company has decided to focus on an as-yet
unannounced graphics controller product, and it has laid off 18 of its 41
employees.&M;

While S3 hopes to license the technology to another company, this is likely
to mark the end of its ACI (Advanced Chip Interconnect) bus and
multiprocessor architecture.&P;  S3's chip sets were unique in several ways.&O;
The modular design supported both uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems
using 386SX, 386, or 486 processors, with either AT, EISA, or Micro Channel
I/O buses.&P;  It was also the first chip set announced that was to provide
copy-back caches.&M;

The complexity of the design was apparently its Achilles' heel.&P;  S3 had
silicon on most of the chips and the remainder ready to tape out, but the
chips had numerous problems.&P;  Despite a $10.4 million second round of
financing closed this summer, S3 determined that it did not have enough
capital to complete both the system logic and the graphics products.&P;  The
company raised $6 million in its initial round of financing, and says that it
has more than $8 million left in the bank.&M;

While development problems appear to be at the heart of S3's difficulties,
the large number of competitors in the system logic business and the lack of
a market for multiprocessor systems no doubt played a part.&P;  This leaves
Chips and Technologies' M/PAX chip set as the only off-the-shelf solution for
multiprocessor systems.&P;  Despite having been introduced nearly a year ago,
C&amp;T has only one announced customer for M/PAX--third-tier vendor Arche
Technologies.&P;  Until more software becomes available that can take advantage
of multiple processors, significant demand for such systems won't develop.&O;

TIGA Claims Victory over 8514/A Texas Instruments has announced the
availability of Windows 3 drivers for its TIGA display standard.&P;  TIGA has
been locked in a battle with IBM's 8514/A standard for the high-resolution
display market.&P;  With IBM's announcement that it is essentially obsoleting
8514/A with XGA, TIGA promoters were quick to proclaim 8514/A dead.&P;  Indeed,
the introduction of XGA leaves companies marketing 8514/A-compatible chips,
such as Chips and Technologies, in a difficult position.&P;  C&amp;T's marketing
manager for its 8514/A chips argued that XGA will have problems in the AT
environment because it depends on bus-master operation.&P;  Ironically, C&amp;T is
also promoting a display accelerator (see cover story) that operates as a bus
master in AT systems.&P;  In any case, XGA will become TI's major competitor,
but it will take a year or so for third-party XGA implementations to appear.&M;

(According to the TI release, the new driver has "the flexibility to support
Windows 3.0 on any TIGA 340-based board, regardless of resolution or color
depth."&P;  While this may be true in principle, it is not quite true in
practice.&P;  The Windows 3 driver requires that the 340-based board be running
TI's TIGA 2.0 software, which must be ported to each hardware design.&P;  As we
have discovered, not all vendors of 34010 boards are supporting TIGA 2.0.&P;  We
happen to own two Wyse 7190 19" display systems, which are based on the
34010.&P;  Wyse has apparently decided not to support TIGA 2.0, leaving its
customer base without an acceptable solution for Windows 3 support.)&O;

Understanding the SPARC Architecture&M;

Over the past three years, we've covered each SPARC implementation as it has
been announced, but haven't covered the architecture itself.&P;  It's now clear
SPARC will be one of the dominant architectures of the 1990s.&P;  This detailed
review of the architecture will help set the stage for the series of new
implementations due in 1991.&M;

Ten years ago, when "RISC" was still mostly a concept and the first arguments
for simple architectures were being made, simplicity of implementation was
seen as perhaps the most important goal of RISC.&P;  This led the Berkeley
architects, who coined the term "RISC", to define a very simple architecture
with as few instructions as possible.&P;  The small number of instructions led
to simple and fast instruction-decode logic.&P;  According to the arguments, the
small decode logic left room for functions that were more important to
overall performance than complex instructions such as memory-to-memory
operations.&P;  The Berkeley team concluded that data cache was the next item to
be integrated on-chip.&P;  To avoid wasting space with cache tags and to
directly speed up procedure calls, they implemented the data cache as a large
register file with overlapping "windows."&M;

The SPARC architecture bears a significant resemblance to the Berkeley RISC
architectures because the goals of the two efforts were compatible and
because some members of the Berkeley team were also part of Sun's
architecture team.&P;  Sun wanted a simple architecture that could be built in a
gate array and that would reduce loads and stores as much possible.&M;

Register Windows&M;

The concept of register windows is not the only resemblance between the
Berkeley RISC architectures and SPARC, but it is the most striking.&P;  As for
the Berkeley RISC architectures, there were several justifications for
including register windows in SPARC:&M;

* To reduce the register-allocation burden on compiler writers.&M;

* To reduce the number of loads and stores in code generated by simple
compilers.&M;

* To exploit on-chip RAM in current and future implementations.&M;

Reducing the number of loads and stores was a primary concern in the
formative stages of SPARC because the first implementations would not have
separate instruction and data buses.&P;  The use of a combined instruction and
data bus was probably influenced by cost considerations:  A combined bus can
mean a cheaper processor package and implies a single external cache, which
is cheaper than two external caches.&M;

Run-Time Stacks&M;

To see how register windows can reduce the number of loads and stores, an
understanding of the basics of run-time stack management is needed.&P;  Figure 1
shows a representation of a run-time stack in memory.&P;  As is typical, the
stack grows from higher addresses to lower addresses, and a "stack pointer"
(whose value is maintained in a processor register) marks the lowest location
in the stack that is currently active.&P;  Stack locations are addressed by
specifying a positive offset from the stack pointer.&M;

The run-time stack is used to support procedure calls in languages such as C.&O;
A compiler generates code for a procedure according to simple rules.&P;  At the
start of a procedure, it generates code that allocates a "stack frame" for
the private use of the procedure (by decrementing the stack pointer).&O;
Following the code for the procedure itself, the compiler generates code that
deallocates the procedure's stack frame (by incrementing the stack pointer).&M;

A compiler generates code to pass parameters using a procedure "calling
convention."&P;  In a typical calling convention, each stack frame consists of
three areas: incoming parameters, private local variables, and outgoing
parameters.&P;  In Figure 1, the shaded area shows how parameters and results
are passed between a calling procedure and a called procedure: the stack
frames of the procedures involved are allocated so that they overlap.&P;  The
overlap area is where outgoing parameters are placed by the calling procedure
("Previous Frame" in Figure 1) and accessed by the called procedure ("Current
Frame").&M;

By using this calling convention, the compiler can compile each of the two
procedures completely independently.&P;  It generates code to reference the
variables on the stack using the appropriate offsets for the procedure being
compiled.&P;  To reference the first parameter, an offset of +9 would be used by
the called procedure ("Current Frame"), while an offset of +0 would be used
by the calling procedure ("Previous Frame").&M;

Stack In Registers&M;

Register windows mimic this stack structure, with two differences: the
structure is implemented in onchip registers, and the sizes of the three
areas are fixed.&P;  (For a memory-based run-time stack, the compiler decides
the size of each area.)&M;

The "stack-in-registers" approach has two major advantages over the run-time
stack in memory.&P;  First, no memory references are needed to access the stack
data, and second, the data is resident in the register file, which means two
operands can be read and a third written in every cycle.&M;

Figure 2 illustrates the operation of register windows.&P;  Each window has
three sets of registers--ins, locals, and outs--that correspond directly to
areas in a run-time stack frame.&P;  At any one time, a single window is active
or "current."&M;

In the SPARC architecture, each window contains 24 registers--eight of each
of the three kinds.&P;  In addition, there are eight "globals" that are always
active regardless of which window is active.&P;  Thus, at any one time, 32
registers are directly addressable.&P;  Gr0 always reads as zero, and writing to
it has no effect.&P;  The SPARC architecture allows implementations to provide
any number of register windows from 1 to 32.&M;

The register file is generally implemented as a big block of registers; the
overlapping effect is produced by the register-address decoding hardware.&P;  To
decide what physical register to address, the decoding circuits use both the
register number from an instruction and the "window number" supplied by a
special processor register.&P;  The outs and ins that overlap actually map to
the same physical registers in the file.&M;

The register file is circular; that is, the "last" window overlaps with the
"first" window.&P;  For example, consider an implementation with three windows,
as in Figure 2.&P;  The outs of the window labeled "Next Window" would overlap
with the ins of the window labeled "Previous Window."&M;

Register File Management&M;

To manage the register windows, SPARC has three special instructions and two
special registers.&P;  The instructions are SAVE, RESTORE, and RETT (return from
trap).&P;  The registers are the CWP (current window pointer) and the WIM
(window invalid mask).&M;

The CWP serves the same purpose for the register windows that the stack
pointer serves for memory-based stack frames: The CWP determines which window
is current (and, by implication, which windows are previous and next).&M;

The WIM determines which of the windows in the register file are "valid" or
available.&P;  For the register windows scheme to function properly, there must
always be one invalid window so that overflow and underflow can be detected.&O;
Overflow (trying to allocate a new window when the register file is "full")
and underflow (trying to deallocate a window when the register file is
"empty") can occur because there are only a few windows on-chip (typically
seven or so) that are trying to contain an arbitrarily long run-time stack.&M;

By always having at least one window marked invalid, a program is guaranteed
to bump into the invalid window as the CWP wraps around the circular window
file.&P;  When a program tries to use the window marked as invalid, a hardware
trap is taken to a routine that either flushes some of the register file
contents to memory or restores some of the register file contents from
memory.&P;  In essence, only a portion of the top of the memory-based run-time
stack is always contained in the register file.&M;

Another reason to always have one window marked invalid is to support fast
trap processing.&P;  SPARC traps automatically decrement the CWP.&P;  In the case
when all but one of the windows is valid, the trap-handling routine will be
guaranteed free access to the window marked as invalid; there is no danger of
the trap routine clobbering valid data in the register file.&P;  The RETT
instruction automatically increments the CWP.&M;

The SAVE and RESTORE instructions perform the basic allocation and
deallocation of windows (stack frames) in the register file.&P;  SAVE decrements
the CWP and checks the appropriate bit in the WIM to see if overflow has
occurred.&P;  RESTORE increments the CWP and checks the appropriate bit in the
WIM to see if underflow has occurred.&M;

One drawback of register windows is the large processor context.&P;  When a task
switch occurs, all valid register windows--including any that have been
written to memory--must be saved.&P;  This is not particularly significant in a
Unix system because of the other system overhead associated with a context
switch, but in a real-time multitasking system it can be a serious problem.&O;
Switching of windows is performed by a separate instruction, not by the CALL
instruction, so it is possible for a compiler to generate code that does not
use register windows within a task.&P;  In this case, register windows can be
used instead on a one-per-task basis to provide fast context switching.&O;
Existing SPARC compilers do not support this mode of operation, however.&M;

Instruction Set&M;

Partially because of register windows, the SPARC instruction set is similar
to the Berkeley RISC instruction set.&P;  Table 1 shows the SPARC instruction
set as of version 7 of the architecture manual.&P;  Some slight modifications
are expected in version 8, such as full multiply and divide instructions (see
previous issue for article on sparclite).&M;

SPARC includes an abundance of load and store instructions.&P;  The usual byte,
halfword, and word operations are provided, and loads of byte and halfword
data can zero or sign extend as desired.&P;  In addition, SPARC can move a
double-word operand (64 bits) with one instruction.&M;

As compared to MIPS and the 29000, SPARC has a fairly rich set of memory
addressing modes.&P;  An address can be any of the following: register,
register-plus-register, register-plus-signed constant, and signed constant.&O;
Figure 3 shows the three encoding formats for SPARC instructions.&P;  The first
two cases under format 3 show the encoding of loads and stores.&P;  The "i" bit
must be set to "1" to choose register-plus-signed constant (case 2).&O;
Otherwise, register-plus-register (case 1) is chosen.&P;  The other two modes
are implemented by setting the rs1 field to select gr0 (which always reads as
zero).&P;  Note that the signed constant is only 13 bits long, but that is
sufficient for the most frequent uses, such as addressing an operand in a
structure or stack frame.&M;

Loads and stores for byte, halfword, word, and double-word operands can
access either "normal" main memory or to any of 256 "alternate address
spaces."&P;  (Actually, four of the 256 "alternate" spaces are the normal
address space, as described below.)&P;  The alternate address space is specified
by the "asi" field in case 1 of format 3.&P;  The versions of these instructions
that use the asi field are privileged, so they cause a trap if executed in
user mode.&M;

The processor always generates an asi.&P;  Four of the asi's are reserved to
indicate the mode and type of access that is being performed: asi 8 is user
instruction space, asi 9 is supervisor instruction space, asi 10 is user data
space, and asi 11 is supervisor data space.&P;  All other asi's are
implementation definable.&P;  Thus, they could be used to control I/O devices or
implement communication protocols in multiprocessor systems.&P;  Alternate
address spaces are used to access the memory management unit in designs using
the "reference" MMU, and are also used for the control registers of the
on-chip peripherals in Fujitsu's SPARClite.&M;

The SPARC architecture defines load and store instructions that transfer data
between memory and a dedicated floating-point register file.&P;  These
instructions can move either a single-precision (32-bit) operand or a
double-precision (64-bit) operand.&P;  The load and store floating-point state
and queue instructions are provided to allow an operating system to handle
floating-point exceptions and sharing of the floating-point unit under
multitasking.&M;

SPARC also defines load and store instructions for a user-defined
coprocessor.&P;  These instructions assume the coprocessor is structured like
the floating-point unit: It has a separate register file and an instruction
queue of pending operations.&M;

Rounding out the set of loads and stores are the LDSTUB and SWAP
instructions.&P;  These instructions are mutual-exclusion primitives used in
multitasking and multiprocessing operating systems.&M;

The SPARC arithmetic and logical instructions are typical for a RISC
processor.&P;  The set includes the usual add and subtract with and without
carry, left and right logical shifts and an arithmetic right shift, and the
logic ops AND, OR, and XOR in plain version and versions with the second
operand complemented.&M;

The add, subtract, and logical instructions are available in two versions:
one that modifies the condition codes (indicated by "cc") and one that leaves
them unchanged.&P;  The ability to specify arithmetic instructions that do not
modify the condition codes is helpful to compiler optimizations that
re-organize instruction sequences, since it can prevent condition codes from
being modified by instructions between the ones calculating the desired
condition and a conditional branch.&M;

All arithmetic, shift, and logical instructions are three-address
register-to-register operations.&P;  Each instruction specifies either three
registers (two sources and a destination) or two registers and a signed
constant (one source register, one source constant, and one destination
register).&P;  Arithmetic instructions use case 2 of format 3.&M;

The SETHI instruction is used in combination with a regular arithmetic
instruction to form a full 32-bit constant in a register.&P;  First, an ADD or
OR instruction that operates on gr0 and a small constant places the lower 13
bits of the 32-bit constant in a register.&P;  Then, a SETHI sets the upper bits
of the register.&M;

One unique feature of the SPARC architecture is its support for tagged data
types.&P;  The support is minimal at best since it consists of only two
instructions: TADDcc and TSUBcc.&P;  These instructions work just like the ADDcc
instruction except that the V (overflow) condition code is determined
differently: an overflow occurs if a regular arithmetic overflow is generated
or if either of the two least-significant bits is set in either source
operand.&P;  As indicated in Table 1, these two instructions come in a variant
(indicated by "tv") that traps if an overflow is genrated.&M;

The least-significant two bits of integer operands are treated as a two-bit
tag by these instructions.&P;  The tag can have four values, and the
architecture defines the value "00" to mean "30-bit integer."&P;  Since the
other three values are not directly implemented by the architecture, a trap
is generated.&P;  The trap handler can then implement whatever function is
appropriate.&P;  This capability was intended for use by AI-oriented languages
such as LISP, but has been rarely used.&M;

The current SPARC architecture has no integer multiply or divide
instructions.&P;  The low frequency of such operations combined with the
difficulty of implementation in the original SPARC gate array probably
explains the absence.&P;  Since multiply is much more frequent than divide, a
multiply step instruction was included.&P;  Had the SPARC architects had a bit
more foresight, they could have defined multiply and divide instructions that
caused a trap, with the trap handler emulating the instructions.&P;  This is the
approach used by AMD's 29000, and it allows a full multiply to be added to
the implementation without requiring software changes to take advantage of
it.&M;

The SPARC Architecture manual gives several examples of how multiplication
and division can be performed.&P;  Using MULScc, a 32 x 32 multiplication with a
64-bit result can be done in roughly 40 instructions, which, assuming cache
hits, is not much less efficient than microprocessors that use microcode.&O;
Division, on the other hand, must be implemented with a subroutine that
executes a few instructions per bit.&M;

Some users have reported that multiply- and divide-intensive programs run
faster on Sun-3's (68000-based machines) than on Sun's SPARC-based machines.&O;
As a result, rumors abound that version 8 of the SPARC architecture will
include multiply and divide instructions.&P;  Indeed, SPARClite (see [mu]PR
11/14/90 p. 1) adds a multiply instruction and divide step.&M;

Branch instructions in the SPARC architecture are fairly typical.&P;  There is a
single unconditional CALL, a slightly more general jump-and-link, a
return-from-trap, and three sets of conditional branch instructions, each of
which tests a different set of condition codes.&P;  The trap-conditionally
instruction is also technically a branch instruction.&M;

CALL is the only instruction that uses format 1.&P;  The 30-bit displacement is
shifted left two bits so CALL can jump to a subroutine anywhere in the 32-bit
address space.&P;  Also, CALL writes the value of the PC, which is the address
of the CALL itself, into out register r[15].&P;  A routine that has been CALLed
must return to the address "r[15]+8."&P;  (The offset of 8 is required because
an offset of 4 would point to next instruction, which is the branch delay
slot.)&P;  Nested subroutines don't have to save the return address, since the
register windows mechanism provides a "new" r[15] for each procedure.&M;

Jump-and-link (JMPL) uses case 2 of format 3.&P;  JMPL is more general than CALL
because the return address is written to the register specified in the rd
field; thus, the return address can be saved in any general register.&P;  Also,
JMPL branches to the address specified by the sum of register rs1 plus either
the register rs2 or the 13-bit constant simm13.&P;  Thus, JMPL can perform an
indirect call.&P;  Also, by specifying gr0 in the rd field, JMPL can implement
the return from a subroutine: rs1 specifies r[15] (actually r[31] in the new
window) and simm13 specifies the integer "+8."&M;

The return-from-trap (RETT) is used only to return from the implicit
subroutine call that is made whenever a trap is taken by the processor.&P;  RETT
takes care of returning to the interrupted instruction stream, switching
processor state if necessary, incrementing the CWP, etc.&P;  RETT is privileged,
as indicated by the "P" in Table 1.&M;

SPARC defines three sets of condition codes: the integer condition codes
(icc), the floating-point condition codes (fcc), and the coprocessor
condition codes (ccc).&P;  A separate group of conditional branch instructions
is defined for each set of condition codes.&P;  All the usual conditional
branches are possible, e.g., branch-not-equal, branch-greater-than, etc.&M;

Conditional branches are always PC-relative and use case 2 of format 2 in
Figure 3.&P;  This gives them a generous 22-bit relative displacement.&M;

The 1-bit "a" field in the format is the "annul" bit.&P;  For conditional
branches, setting "a" to zero yields the familiar delayed branch: the
instruction immediately following the branch (the delay instruction) is
always executed regardless of the outcome of the branch.&M;

When "a" is set to one, the behavior changes.&P;  When the branch is not taken,
the delay instruction is not executed.&P;  When the branch is taken, the delay
instruction is executed.&P;  Thus, annulling conditional branches are optimized
for use at the bottom of loops: the annulling action removes a restriction on
what instructions can be placed in the delay slot because the delay
instruction will not execute when the loop exits.&M;

The trap-on-integer-condition-code (Ticc) instruction can test for all the
usual conditions.&P;  If the test is true, a trap is taken.&P;  This instruction
can be used to implement system calls in a protected operating system or to
perform bounds checking on array accesses.&M;

As discussed previously, the SAVE and RESTORE instructions change the CWP and
perform a check against the WIM to see if an overflow or underflow has
occurred.&P;  In addition, SAVE and RESTORE act like regular ADD instructions.&O;
These instructions use case 2 of format 3 in Figure 3 just like the ADD
instruction and can therefore specify registers and a constant to be added.&O;
The one twist is that the source registers are read from the old window (the
one addressed by CWP before the SAVE or RESTORE changed it) while the result
is written into the new window (the one addressed by the new CWP).&M;

This allows SAVE and RESTORE to simultaneously allocate a new window in the
on-chip register file and allocate a new stack frame in main memory.&P;  A
subroutine would need to allocate both if it needed more local storage than
is available in a single window.&M;

The RD and WR instructions are used to read and write special-purpose
processor state registers.&P;  These include the Y register, which is used to
capture the high word of a 32-by-32-bit multiplication performed using the
multiply-step instruction; the PSR (processor status register); the WIM
(window invalid mask) register; and the TBR (Trap Base Register), which
contains the base address of a table of addresses of exception handling
routines.&M;

The IFLUSH instruction is provided to permit a program to flush the
instruction cache.&M;

The FPop instruction encodes all of the floating-point operations.&P;  This
instruction uses case 3 of format 3 in Figure 3.&P;  The "opf" field encodes the
various operations.&P;  As with the integer arithmetic instructions, this format
encodes three-address register-to-register operations.&P;  FPop encodes a large
number of operations including conversions (F?TO?, where the question marks
are replaced by "i" for integer, "s" for single, "d" for double, and "x" for
extended) and all the usual arithmetic.&M;

SPARC is the only major RISC architecture to support extended-precision
(128-bit) operands.&P;  So far, however, SPARC hardware has only implemented
single- and double-precision operations.&M;

The CPop instruction is like the FPop instruction except that no operations
are pre-defined.&P;  The semantics of the CPop instruction are dependent on
specific coprocessor implementations.&M;

Bus Implementations&M;

SPARC implementations have been criticized because the processor chips have
only a single 32-bit data bus.&P;  Other chips, such as the 29000 and 88000,
have separate buses, and the MIPS chips use a single bus twice per cycle to
get the effect of two buses.&P;  The single bus means that loads and stores take
at least one additional cycle when compared to chips with separate or
time-multiplexed buses (instruction fetching must be suspended while the bus
is used for data).&P;  This is one reason the SPARC-based machines have yielded
less performance than competing machines (notably MIPS) at equal clock rates.&M;

Despite this deficiency, SPARC-based systems are some of the cheapest Unix
machines available.&P;  Cost is one place where a single bus is an advantage: it
allows the easy implementation of a single, unified external cache.&P;  Also,
SPARC-based systems are starting to overcome the performance degradation of
the single bus with sheer clock speed.&P;  The 40-MHz SPARCStation-2 compares
favorably to other workstations based on processors with separate buses.&M;

The lack of separate buses is turning out to be a temporary deficiency as
chip densities increase.&P;  Even the inexpensive SPARClite has separate on-chip
buses and caches, and future high-end implementations are likely to use a
similar implementation.&M;

Conclusions&M;

The "S" in SPARC ostensibly stands for scalable (though rumors are that it
originally stood for "Sun").&P;  While SPARC is probably no more scalable than
any other architecture in most respects, it is truly scalable in one sense:
the register file can be scaled up or down as technology permits.&P;  The only
software affected by the register file size is part of the operating system.&O;
For most other architectures, the register file size is fixed for all
implementations.&P;  In practice, however, this scalability has not been useful;
all existing implementations use either seven or eight windows.&P;  Adding more
windows is of no benefit unless the application makes frequent, deeply nested
subroutine calls.&M;

SPARC is not technically better than other RISC architectures.&P;  If an
application really needs a large register file, the 29000 is probably a
better choice since only 32 registers are addressable at any one time in
SPARC.&P;  The 88000 has an extra addressing mode--base plus scaled index--and
superior bit field support.&P;  MIPS has added the few features it lacks (but
SPARC has) in the MIPS-2 architecture, which includes annulling branches,
double-word memory reference instructions, and fully interlocked loads.&M;

While SPARC is not an outstanding architecture, it is certainly viable (as
tens of thousands of satisfied SPARC users will attest), and it will continue
to build momentum because of Sun's success and the number of semiconductor
vendors developing SPARC chips.&P;  Far more SPARC-based Unix systems have been
sold than those based on any other RISC processor, and there are more new
implementations of SPARC in progress than for any other architecture.&O;

PLX Puts LAN Chips On PC Buses&M;

PLX Technology has announced plans for the 90x0 family of bus master
interface chips.&P;  With a small amount of glue logic, they adapt popular LAN
chips (Intel's 82596, National semiconductor's DP83932, and TI's TMS380C16/4)
to standard expansion buses (PC/AT, Micro Channel, and EISA).&P;  There is also
a generic version with 486-like control signals.&P;  Each chip is specific to
one interface, as shown in Table 1.&P;  They differ from more complex bus master
interfaces, such as Chips and Technologies' 82C614 for Micro Channel and
Intel's 82355 for EISA, both because they are chip-specific and because they
are intended to work with peripheral chips that have on-chip FIFO buffering
and DMA address registers, allowing these features to be eliminated from the
interface chip.&P;  The LAN chips are designed to reside on the processor's
local bus; the PLX chips adapt them to PC expansion buses.&M;

In the past, PLX has been known for PLDs with hefty 48-mA outputs.&P;  The
combination of logic with powerful drivers is useful for direct drive of bus
control lines, and PLX's earlier bus interface products are based on
programmed versions of these chips.&P;  The latest chips, however, use
standard-cell technology to provide higher integration and greater
programmability.&P;  By using a flexible design adaptable to each chip and each
bus, a large family of products was created with a minimum investment.&M;

The design was developed by BusTek, a small Santa Clara-based company
previously responsible for NCR's 86C05 (see [mu]PR 11/89 p. 15), a bus master
interface controller with strap-selectable modes for PC/AT, Micro Channel,
EISA, and NuBus.&P;  Although initially focused on chip design, BusTek has
evolved toward board-level products.&P;  Currently they offer a set of boards
based on the NCR chip, and they plan to offer at least one product based on a
PLX chip.&P;  BusTek chairman Peter Harvey says Intel's 82596SX is being
"aggressively marketed, price-wise," and he expects that an AT board
combining the Intel Ethernet controller with a PLX interface will be a
high-volume product.&M;

The chips are fabricated using a 1.2-micron CMOS process, using foundry
services provided by S-MOS (Seiko).&P;  They are specified for 90 mA max supply
current and are packaged in 128-pin PQFPs.&M;

Interface Architecture&M;

All of the interfaces can be described by the same generic block diagram,
shown in Figure 1.&P;  In each case, the communications chip is designed to
operate as a bus master on a CPU's local bus.&P;  The interface chip translates
the control signals for CPU-like cycles generated by the communications chip
into control signals on the expansion bus.&P;  It also controls the buffers and
latches between the expansion bus and the on-board buses, and it enables the
peripheral board BIOS ROM, ID bytes, and a 16-byte ID ROM.&M;

The upper address bits must be decoded externally for the BIOS ROM, but
address bits 16 through 13 are decoded in the interface chip, allowing the
location and size of the BIOS ROM to be programmable.&P;  In Micro Channel and
EISA systems, the ID bytes are gated onto the bus when the system BIOS
software interrogates each slot during power-on automatic system
configuration.&P;  In PC/AT systems, which have no set-up mode, the interface
chip automatcially loads the ID bytes into its internal configuration
registers.&M;

The interface chip has four 8-bit registers for controlling the bus interface
and the communications chip.&P;  The configuration registers are mapped into the
I/O address space, above the expansion board ID bytes.&P;  About half of the
control and status fields in the configuration registers have identical
implementations in each type of interface, which simplifies writing drivers
for a family of products based on different PLX interface chips.&P;  The other
half are specific to an expansion bus or a communications chip.&M;

The nine fields common to all of PLX's chips are:&M;

* Enable I/O Card--enables the board for normal operation, cleared by hard
reset.&P;  On Micro Channel and EISA, the BIOS sets this bit after initializing
the other configurations fields.&M;

* Enable Host IRQ3..0--selects the interrupt request line to use when
interrupting the host.&M;

* Slave I/O Data Size--selects the data width for host access to the
communications chip.&M;

* External User Pins 3..0--controls four bits of parallel output, available
for user-defined functions.&M;

* I/O Address--controls the location of the configuration registers, ID
bytes, and ID ROM.&M;

* BIOS Address--controls the location of the address space decoded for the
peripheral's BIOS ROM.&M;

* BIOS Size--controls the size of the BIOS ROM address space.&M;

* Enable Channel Check--enables assertion of the -CHCK bus signal when a host
bur error occurs.&M;

* Channel Check Indicator--reports whether this board is asserting -CHCK.&M;

The bit positions for these fields are the same in each chip, except for the
Enable I/O Card and Channel Check Indicator fields which differ because of
differences between EISA and Micro Channel conventions.&M;

Conclusion&M;

These chips are the most highly integrated solutions for the interfaces they
implement because they are the only chips custom-designed for these
interfaces.&P;  Proprietary controllers using 386- or 486-like control signals
can use the generic interface for adaptability to a large range of expansion
buses.&O;

An OS Carol&M;

The CEO's mood matched the foul Seattle weather as he left his office that
day.&P;  Granted, his company's annual sales had just passed the billion-dollar
mark--the toads in finance still hadn't run the exact numbers--and his own
net worth was pushing three billion on paper.&P;  Not bad for a 35-year-old
dropout.&P;  But his new $10 million lake house still wasn't done, and his $1
million custom-built Porsche was hung up in customs over some silly
technicality.&P;  Even worse, the press was starting to turn nasty.&P;  Business
Month had done a particularly mean-spirited hatchet-job on him in November,
and as the cover story, no less.&M;

"Good afternoon, sir, and have a Merry Christmas!"&M;

The CEO looked up to see a fresh-faced employee arriving to start the evening
shift.&P;  "R.&P;  Cratchit," his badge said.&P;  Must be a new guy in finance, the
CEO thought.&P;  He'd given all the other departments Christmas Eve off.&P;  "Bah,
Humbug!" the CEO muttered.&M;

As he walked, a hollow voice cut through the nortwest wind.&P;  A tall, noble,
Scottish-looking gentleman seemed to appear in the CEO's path.&P;  It looked
like--was it?--could it really be him?&P;  It looked like Kildall, but he'd
dropped by the wayside years ago, seven years, to be exact.&P;  Sure, there were
persistent rumors of sightings near Monterey, but no one really knew.&O;
Everyone just assumed Kildall was dead.&M;

"...William..." the voice whispered again.&P;  "You've done much to hinder the
software industry you claim to embrace.&P;  I'm here to warn you, to show you
the evil of your ways.&P;  Before the morning's dawn you shall experience three
visions.&P;  Do not shun them!&P;  You can save yourself still, if you choose, if
you try."&P;  And with that, the specter vanished.&M;

The First of the Three Spirits&M;

That night, at the CEO relaxed with a glass of warm Jolt, he slipped a
videotape into his home multi-media center.&P;  A title appeared on the
screen--"The Ghost of Operating Systems Past," it said, but something was
clearly amiss.&P;  The TV itself was turned off, and besides he'd meant to rent
a travelogue on Fiji.&M;

The film opened in a modestly appointed board room,  with a meeting already
in progress.&P;  Half a dozen engineers and administrators circled the table.&O;
The film was set in the early eighties, the CEO guessed, based on the actors'
hair styles and clothing.&P;  At the head of the table sat a pimply-faced,
bespectacled young boy.&M;

"But we have to ship this month," the boy was shouting.&P;  "It's in the
contract!"&M;

"But we can't Bill!"&P;  a software-type responded.&P;  "It's not just that we're
not done, it's more fundamental than that.&P;  The whole concept is flawed!&O;
Half the functions we need were never defined, and without them, the system
is brain damaged!"&M;

"What do you mean?"&P;  the boy shot back.&P;  "Didn't Dad get me the rights to the
whole operating system?"&M;

"Yes, but the only CP/M functions they even tried to clone were the ones in
release 1.7, not 2.2.&P;  It's not an operating system, it's a toy.&P;  We had to
change a bunch of stuff to get it to work at all.&P;  We're trying to maintain
source code now that's been written on three different machines, in three
different assembly languages, with three different syntaxes.&P;  It takes a
whole day just to build each new version, and we have to patch in all the
branch addresses by hand.&P;  We never know for sure whether we caught them all,
and even if we did, the system just isn't right for this machine.&P;  It's
single-threaded, it can't manage memory, it's hardware dependent, it doesn't
even start to use the CPU effectively..."&M;

"It doesn't have to be good," the CEO screamed.&P;  "It just has to be done!&P;  If
you idiots can't get it out the door by Friday, I'll take it home and finish
it up myself.&P;  I'll write it all in BASIC, if I have to, but I'll have your
jobs if we don't ship on time!"&M;

The CEO frowned and shut off the VCR.&P;  He thought maybe he'd already seen the
film, years ago.&P;  Something about it looked strangely familiar, but he
couldn't place what.&P;  In any case, it was too much like the hassles he faced
at work every day to be fun.&P;  Christmas Eve.&P;  Nothing good was on the tube,
so off he went to bed.&M;

The Second of the Three Spirits&M;

Just as the CEO was about to doze off, there was a pounding at the door, and
a stranger came in, dressed all in white--layer upon layer of program
listings, it appeared, wrapped with chains made of paper tape.&P;  "Who are
you?"&P;  the CEO cried out.&P;  "How did you get in, and what do you want with
me?"&M;

"I am the Ghost of Operating Systems Present," the figure replied.&P;  "I've
come to show you how your employees spend Christmas, while you lie here in
your warm bed.&P;  Come, William, look outside."&M;

The CEO arose and walked to the window, but what he saw outside was his
company's parking lot.&P;  A figure his own size and build was leaving the
building main entrace, just as he himself had done that very afternoon.&P;  He
could hear the footsteps.&M;

"Good afternoon, sir, and have a Merry Christmas!" he heard.&P;  It was him, and
that Cratchit toad from finance.&P;  The apparition lifted the CEO and carried
him out through the window, and they followed Cratchit into the building,
down the hall, and into his office.&P;  Cratchit set down his coat and picked up
a ringing telephone.&M;

"Hello, dear...Merry Christmas to you, too...No, not quite, I've still got
this finance report to finish...Yeah, it's almost done.&P;  The text is
finished, I just have to patch in some figures, spreadsheets, and
tables...Not long, maybe another hour...I love you, too, dear."&M;

The desk clock read 4:00, but the digits began to advance faster and faster,
until the hours were flying by.&P;  Outside, the sky darkened, and the moon rose
high overhead.&P;  The clock slowed to a stop at 11:00, as the phone again began
to ring.&M;

"Yes, yes, dear, I'm okay...I'm sorry, I didn't know how late it was...No,
it's not going well.&P;  I thought it would be easy, but the information is all
on other machines.&P;  Whenever I start the TOPS network, Windows 3.0 crashes.&O;
I gotta reboot under DOS to retrieve the data, then reload Windows.&P;  And the
data formats are all different.&P;  The spreadsheets were created under OS/2,
and the artwork uses AutoCAD 386, but that conflicts with my DOS extenders,
so I gotta reedit my Config Dot Sys and Autoexec files each time and reboot
again.&P;  And the engineers did all their tables with XROFF, under XENIX.&P;  I've
spent six hours digging through documentation, trying to convert the
files...Yes, I know this is Timothy's first Christmas, but I've gotta finish
this before I come home...I don't know, by dawn, I hope...I love you too,
dear."&M;

The CEO awoke, startled, and sat straight up, back in his bed, back home.&P;  "I
didn't know!" he exclaimed.&P;  "When we adopted Proctor and Gamble's
soap-powder approach to software marketing, I thought OS proliferation would
just make it easier for users to select one of our programs off the shelf.&P;  I
just wanted to sell more software.&P;  I didn't know what a disaster we'd
create.!"&M;

But he was speaking to no one.&P;  The ghastly figure in white was gone.&M;

The Last of the Spirits&M;

There would be three visions, the Scotsman had warned, so the CEO slumped
back on his pillow, emotionally drained, awaiting the worst.&P;  Suddenly, a
cold breeze blew over the bed, and the CEO looked up.&P;  A tall, faceless
figure towered over the foot of his bed, cloaked only in a hooded,
midnight-blue robe.&M;

"And you," the CEO asked, "I suppose you're the Ghost of Operating Systems
Future, come to torment me as well?"&P;  But the hulking figure stood silently,
and beckoned the CEO again to the window.&M;

This time, as he looked through the glass, the CEO found himself looking into
a living room.&P;  Cratchit was there again, setting a book-sized object below a
brightly decorated tree.&P;  He looked older now, with graying temples and
thinning hair.&P;  "You know, dear," he said to a dark-haired women with soft,
kindly eyes, standing by the stairs, "I'm sure glad we got Timmy this Micro
2000 computer.&P;  The technology's come a long way in the last ten years.&P;  The
Intel 786 microprocessor contains four 386-compatible CPUs, two i860 vector
coprocessors, a full DVI multimedia subsystem with super-enhanced ZGA, and
half a meg of cache.&P;  200 megahertz, 1.2 GOPS...it's just incredible, honey!&M;

"And the software's better, too.&P;  The OS automatically configures the DOS
extenders, and it's got built-in device drivers for flash disks, CD-ROMs, pen
data-entry tablets, animated icons, ear-cons, speech synthesis, voice
recognition--the works.&P;  And configuration is a breeze.&P;  Even with DOS and
all the drivers permanently installed, the 16 Megabyte main memory chip still
has room for a 640-kilobyte application program.&P;  I'm glad everything's voice
operated now--a keyboard and display would have put us way over budget."&M;

His wife smiled sweetly, patiently.&P;  "We're in debt as it is, Bob.&P;  I swear,
you spend far too much on Timmy's presents every year.&P;  MacAnalyst says
you're still overcompensating for that Christmas when you didn't get home
'til the 29th.&P;  Oh well, at least it will help Tim with his school work."&O;
She turned toward the stairs and shouted, "Okay, Timmy, you can come down
now.&P;  Santa's brought you a big pile of presents!"&M;

A young boy ran eagerly down the stairs.&P;  "Hyper hyper hyper hyper hyper!&P;  A
Micro 2000 computer!"&P;  he shouted, running to the nondescript tan box below
the tree.&P;  "Megarad plus!"&M;

"System Power On!"&P;  he directed, and then, while the OS booted and ran its
diagnostics, he turned his attention to the other presents.&P;  Several minutes
later the initialization was done, and the box spoke out in a cool,
mechanical voice.&M;

"Power On Self Test Successful," it said.&P;  "Microsoft DOS Version Eight Point
Three Bee Seven, Copyright Two Oh Oh Oh."&P;  Another pause.&P;  "Bee Colon Root
Slash Prompt."&M;

Timmy was ecstatic!&P;  He'd just finished the first-grade PC-education module,
so he knew just what to say.&P;  "Cee Colon Return!"&P;  he instructed.&P;  "Dir Star
Dot Star Return!"&M;

"Cee Root Directory...Autocad Slash Dot Null...Autoexec Dot Bat...Config Dot
Sys..." the computer intoned.&P;  Timmy scowled.&P;  He'd meant to open the game
directory first, and this recitation could take forever.&P;  "Control Alt
Delete!"&P;  he interjected.&M;

The End of It&M;

The CEO spun around and looked back at the spirit in tears.&P;  "Is this what
will become of the software industry?&P;  It's got to be fixed!&P;  I'll see that
it gets fixed!&P;  I'll convert the code to the 386.&P;  I'll learn the 386
protection model.&P;  I'll even find out what 'virtual memory' means!&P;  I'll make
DOS as user-friendly as the Macintosh.&P;  I'll do it, I swear to God I will,
even if I have to write it all myself, in BASIC!"&P;  And with that the specter
smiled wanly, and vanished in a wisp of smoke.&M;

And William was better than his word.&P;  He set a team of his best and most
creative designers to work on the project and gave them free reign to follow
their dreams.&P;  The resulting OS was not just easy to use, it was universal.&O;
It could run multiple tasks, in multiple windows, each protected from the
others, with transparent network support, and could emulate multiple
operating system interfaces, just as Digital Research had done with
Concurrent DOS since the mid '80s.&M;

It could handle multiple processors, run on any hardware, load any operating
system's files, and automatically emulate the machine language of non-native
CPU architectures.&P;  With the 386 protection model enabled, users finally
found themselves freed from the threat of viral infections and unauthorized
security violations.&P;  So DOS was not permanently crippled, but grew to become
healthy, and strong, and the PC user community everywhere lived happily ever
after.&M;

MErry Christmas, dear readers, and God bless Us, Every One.&O;

Inside 1990 is coming to an end, and it's time for PC Labs to catch its
collective breath.&P;  To paraphrase Winston Churchill, never before has so much
hardware packed in so many foamfilled cardboard boxes been crammed into so
few storage rooms.&M;

A look back through this year's issues of PC Magazine shows that PC Labs
benchmarked 285 or so PCs this year, including 83 portable PCs, 68 33-MHz 386
machines, 52 386SX systems, 39 20-MHz 386 machines, 24 486-based systems, and
one IBM PS/1.&M;

And that's just counting the big boxes.&P;  Don't forget the 131 printers,
almost 60 monitors and video cards, 12 data projectors, and 10 desktop
plotters.&M;

When we add the dozens of products the PC LAN Labs staff evaluated in Florida
and the hundreds of software packages we rounded up and reviewed, it's
suddenly easy to understand all too well what the Census Bureau has been
going through, and we empathize.&M;

The person in charge of all this testing is newly appointed Director of PC
Labs Jim Galley, a man whose interests extend far beyond computer technology.&M;

Galley likes freedom in as many dimensions as possible.&P;  His hobbies, which
include scuba diving and soaring, let him roam the seas and the skies.&P;  As PC
Labs Director, Galley gets to cruise through the multidimensional interplay
of new hardware and software products and the strategies behind them.&P;  The
Labs' job is to reduce all the claims to clarity, and Galley brings us a
unique background to lead that effort.&M;

He joins us from a major New York financial institution, where a coworker
said of him, "Sure, I enjoy seeing new stuff, but Jim really gets into it."&O;
His role there was to sort through the onslaught of new technologies in order
to select the products that would give his company a competitive advantage.&M;

In addition to being part of the original 386 evaluation team, his
explorations have taken him into the worlds of virtual reality, neural
networks, local- and wide-area connectivity, and virtually every phase of
personal computers and their applications.&P;  As he looks forward to
scrutinizing the countless products that come through PC Labs, Galley says,
"This is a great opportunity to offer solutions not to just one company, but
to everyone who reads PC Magazine."&M;

All in all, 1991 looks like it will be the busiest year yet for Galley and
his staff, but first they get a little break to contemplate the 12 days of
Christmas.&P;  Let's just hope they don't bring their work home with them and
end up testing a partridge in a pear tree.&O;

Letters&M;

WHERE IS SUPPORT HEADED?&M;

I have a few comments regarding Jim Seymour's column "900-Numbers: Where
support Is Headed?"&P;  (September 25, 1990).&M;

Toll-free, 800-number support best not be dead.&P;  Where I work, every
long-distance toll call is accounted for, and the funding for long-distance
phone calls comes out of my department's budget.&P;  It is my money, and I do
care what I have to pay for a support call.&M;

If a program's documentation were adequate, that would be one thing.&P;  Most
manuals barely tell you how to install the software, so users must now call
the 900-number support line for answers that should have been in the manual
in the first place.&P;  This creates a large volume of callers, and so people
often end up on hold for extended periods with the meter running.&M;

If I don't like the documentation or the support practices for a product, I
cannot recommend it.&P;  Bernard J. Siegel University City, Texas&M;

In his September 25 column, Jim Seymour says that we are going to have to
start paying for technical support.&P;  He seems to think this is justified and
appropriate.&M;

Good software technical support is really a warranty.&P;  When someone buys a
product, they expected to be able to use it.&P;  I think any product has an
ethical obligation to fulfill this most basic customer expectation.&M;

Just imagine going back to your car dealer.&P;  You think your transmission
isn't shifting properly.&P;  The service manager says, "Okey, give me $200 and
we'll talk about it."&P;  If the automobile industry adopted this "pay me before
I'll talk to you" service policy, I think the homicide rate would double.&M;

Free technical support can also be used for the company's advantage, too.&O;
It's a very valuable source of feedback.&P;  Tim Hickox Cerritos, California&M;

I read Jim seymour's column on support with growing dismay.&P;  Sure, I'm happy
to pay for support if I'm too dumb to figure it out and it's in the manual.&O;
But, for example, what happens when my unit needs repairs?&P;  The supplier
wants me to pay for a call (on a 900-number, yet) to get an RMA number so
that I can pay the shipping to send the unit, which they will keep for an
unknown length of time.&P;  At least let me call at regular long-distance rates!&O;
Many companies routinely block 900 and 976 calls.&M;

Service is a complicated issue , but charging the calls is not going to make
a company any friends.&P;  J.P.&P;  Harrison Hood River, Oregon&M;

THE 386SX: TOO POPULAR?&M;

Irecently read your article "The Cheapest 386SXs Ever" (August 1990).&P;  I was
impressed with your Editor's Choice: the Micro Express ME 386SX, so I called
the company and placed an order.&P;  From there it has been downhill, and I
finally canceled my order today.&M;

The 800 number is always busy, and later I called the regular number, but no
one returned my calls.&P;  I feel you owe it to your readers to advise them that
a 15-month warranty means nothing when you can't get through the company.&O;
Jim DeProspero Lake Oswego, Oregon&M;

In July I placed an order for your "Editor's Choice" 389SX, the Micro Express
("The Cheapest 386SXs Ever," August 1990).&P;  The computer did not arrive when
promised, and when I called the company's customer service department, I was
told that they would look into the matter and call me back that day.&P;  I never
received a call.&P;  My follow-up calls failed to elicit a response.&O;
Reluctantly, I canceled my order.&M;

Just got my VISAbill, and guess what?&P;  I had been charged for the computer I
had canceled and never received.&P;  Jean Kreiling Brooklyn, New York&M;

A representative for Micro Express responds:&M;

As a result of your article, sales at Micro Express have tripled; the company
has already shipped thousands of those machines (the ME 386SX) at the price
quoted in the article.&M;

Unfortunately, Micro Express has been caught by the storage of 386SX chips
from Intel.&P;  due to this chips shortage, Micro Express is forced to quote
lead times of about 12 weeks, when they normally ship in five days.&P;  In fact,
they have started a waiting list for ner callers who insist on that machine.&M;

The calls have been coming in so hot and heavy that Micrp Express has
installed a new phone system, with several more lines.&P;  They have doubled the
manufacturing staff, added new tech support people, and new salespeople.&P;  The
machine is absolutely for sale at the price in the article for anyone who can
wait.&P;  David Kaye President, KPR Inc. Public Relations for Micro Express&M;

We've heard from many companies that there is a severe shortage of 386SX
chips out there.&P;  Readers, please be patient!--Ed.&M;

KEEP BOOKS THE&M;

WAY THEY BELONG&M;

I'm responding to the letters about the Encyclopaedia Britannica ("CD-ROM vs.&O;
Books," Letters, September 25,1990).&P;  I own a complete set of Britannica 3,
bound in leather.&P;  the books are impressive, and I, my wife, and our
homeschooled son use them frequently.&M;

The books were one of the first things I purchased when I bought my first
house.&P;  I have subsequently changed both houses and bookshelves; however, I
still have the books.&M;

I'm a engineer and former programmer, and I have owned computers.&P;  I like
computers and use them for what they are good at; I would not want the
encyclopedias on disk or CD-ROM.&P;  Please thank Stan D. Frank for his
thoughful response.&P;  Adrian J. Cramer Claremont, California&M;

LET THE DONOR BEWARE&M;

I applaud Bill Machrone's recommendation to give used computers away to
schools, churches, and other organizations in his October 16, 1990, column,
"Upgrading the Installed Base."&P;  Many schools and churches desperately need
computers.&M;

I must point out, however, that in many cases where the computer has been
used in a business, the donor's basis is zero, yielding no tax deduction for
the gift.&P;  This is because they have either owned it long enough to have
written off completely or had already taken advantage of some special
provisions in the tax code that allowed them to write off the entire amount
of the computer the year it was purchased.&M;

In either case, since they have already written off the cost of the computer
once.&P;  they will not get to write it off again when they will give it away.&O;
Writing off the same thing twice is definitely not allowed.&P;  Jay Norris
Topeka, Kansas&M;

He's right.&P;  You cannot always get a tax deduction when you donate a computer
to a charitable organization.&P;  There are, however, exceptions to every rule.&O;
Please consult a tx advisor before making any tax decisions.--Ed.&M;

LIFETIME WARRANTIES&M;

In regard to a letter about lifetime warranties, from Jeremy B. Clark
(Letters, September 25, 1990), I purchased two boxes of ten BASF 3.5-inch 2HD
disks.&P;  One disk in each box had bad sectors.&P;  I mailed noth disks to BASF
with a print screen on the formatting results.&M;

Less than two weeks later I received a letter of apology and six new disks!&O;
Needless to say, I am a BASF customer for life.&P;  Teresa Van Wagner Sparr,
Florida&M;

WHY JOHNNY CAN'T COMPUTE&M;

Yesterday I read Bill Machrone's column "Why Johnny Can't Compute,"
(September 25, 1990) in which he bemoans that business isn't doing its part
to help today's students become computer literate.&P;  Machrome specially
referred to a grocery chain that donated one Apple IIC to any customer who
saved $300,000 in register receipts.&P;  He asserted that while the program was
a "nice" gesture, it was something of an exercise in futility.&M;

Today I read an article in the Minneapolis Star Tribune telling how Lunds, a
Minneapolis-based grocery chain, has run a similar program, where an Apple
computer is donated for every $100,000 in receipts collected.&P;  In this past
year, this has resulted in 342 computers given to 160 schools.&P;  Lunds spent
over half a million dollars on the giveaway.&P;  Not bad! Marty Proops Hopkins,
Minnesota&M;

In Bill Machrone's September 25 column he states, "The first challenge is to
get computers, real computers, into the classroom."&M;

Although mine might be an unpopular point of view, I firmly believe that the
choice of device to install in our schools is irrelevant; it's the
application of that device that matters.&M;

Teachers should stress that computers are not an end in themselves; they are
a means to an end.&P;  Students shoulf be taught how to program properly and not
to be dependent on prepackaged software.&M;

The computer is a tool with which the student can get something done.&O;
Teachers should emphasize this point by integrating computer solutions into
their existing science and math curricula, rather than teaching computer
science only as a discrete subject.&M;

It's not the machine that's important in teaching computer literacy, it's the
teaching technique that matters.&P;  Johnny's poorly written program will fail
just as miserably on a 32K RAM machine as on a 1MB RAM machine.&P;  Roger Claff
New York, New YOrk&M;

WE NEED MORE!&M;

Jim Seymour's cover story ("The First 24 486/25 PCs: Giant Step or Stepping
Stone?"&P;  September 11, 1990) refers to a legend that Samuel Gompers had once
said the job of labor leaders is "on every occasion to shout 'More!!!'"&M;

Here is what Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor (AFL)
from 1886 to 1924, actually said:&M;

"What does labor want?&P;  We want more schoolhouses and fewer jails, more books
and fewer arsenals, more learning and less vice, more constant work and less
crime, more leisure and less greed, more justice and less revenge." Richard
Khamsi Eureka, California&M;

BACKSOLVER BACKLASH&M;

Craig Stinson's review of Lotus 1-2-3-/G("1-2-3/G: The Super Solver," August
1990) states that the current version of Backsolver "does not include a
command to restrict adjustable cell values to whole numbers, so for many
real-world problems, you will need to round off the result."&M;

As I recall, one of the basic tenets of Integer Linear Programming is that an
LP solution confined to integers can be widely different than one that is not
so constrained.&P;  If you readers run Backsolver, get a noninteger solution,
then round it off as Mr. Stinson suggests, they could be off by many orders
of magnitude.&M;

That's not very significant unless your job, your company, or your life rides
on the results of the analysis.&P;  Woody Leonhard Coal Creek Canyon, Colorado&M;

CALCULATOR-EQUIPPED&M;

KEYBOARDS&M;

I am trying to find a company that manufactures and distributes a keyboard
with a calculator built into the right side.&P;  Can you helf?&M;

Gary Nusca&M;

Hamilton, Ontario&M;

Canada&M;

MicroLab in Farmington Hill, Michigan, has a full line of PCs with
calculator-equipped keyboards, and sells them for $79.&P;  The calculator is
battery-powered and operates separately from the PC keys, so there are no
compatibility problems (it also means there's no way to paste the calculator
results into a document).&M;

The Focus 5001 keyboard also has an extra set of function keys (one across
the top and another in two columns along the left side).&P;  It's designed to be
used as a replacement for standard AT-style keyboards and may work on
computers with other keyboards, though you should check with MicroLab
(313-474-7711) before ordering if you're planning to replace anything other
than an IBM keyboard.&M;

The company also offers the keyboard as an option on its line of 386 and
386SX PCs.&M;

ADDING MEMORY TO A LAPTOP&M;

I own an NEC PowerMate SX Plus which came standard with 2MB of RAM.&P;  However,
now that I'm using Windows 3.0, I would like to add another 2MB.&P;  Apparently,
NEChas configured this system in such a way that any memory expansion can
only be achieved by purchasing an NEC expansion board for about $1,800 for
2MB.&P;  This is an unfair amount to pay for such a standard upgrade, especially
since the laptop itself was little more than $2,000.&M;

Is it possible to install additional RAM in any other way?&M;

Scott Stallings&M;

Rancho Cucamonga, california&M;

There's always another way--though your voices are usually more restricted
with laptops.&M;

Laptop design are so intricate that an owner can make very few upgrades;
fortunately, memory is an exception.&M;

First Source International sells memory upgrades for a wide variety of
laptops, including your NEC PowerMate.&M;

Memory prices changes as frequently as the weather, but these were the stated
quotes in late September: A 1- to 2MB upgrade kit cost $375 win 1MB onboard;
the second MB kit costs an additional $292.&M;

A 4- to 8MB board cost $992 with 4MB already in place; a kit that adds 4MB
more costs $875.&M;

First Source International is located in Aliso Viega, Calif.; you can reach
the company at 800-535-5892.&M;

THE SEARCH FOR THE ELUSIVE&M;

LAPTOP CURSOR&M;

I find that the cursor on my Compaq LTE 286 is nearly invisible when I use
WordPerfect 5.0.&P;  Is there a patch or some alternative that will convert the
blinking line cursor to a blinking or solid box that will be more readily
seen?&M;

Roy W. Menninger&M;

Topeka, Kansas&M;

There are a couple of inexpensive programs that can take the strain out of
editing on a laptop.&M;

Both No-Squint II Cursor Enhancer (SkiSoft Publishing, Lexington, Mass.;&O;
800-662-3622; $49.95) and EZC Smart Cursor (Triple S Software, Corona,
Calif.; 714-278-3780; $37.95) will let you make the cursor larger and have a
variety of options for the shape that the cursor takes.&M;

SWITCHING CONFIG.SYS&M;

AT BOOT TIME&M;

I read a while back about a program that allowed setting configuration
information at boot time.&P;  I remember thinking that it was an interesting
program, but one for which I would never have a use.&P;  I should never say
"never."&M;

I now have a number of different CONFIG.XXX and AUTOEXEC.XXX files that I
select via a.&P;  BAT file and then reboot my system to make the change.&P;  I
would very much like to specify my configuration at boot time.&M;

Rev.&P;  Lloyd Landers, Jr.&M;

Bartlesville, Oklahoma&M;

The program you're thinking of was written by PC Magazaine's assembly
language ace Michael Mefford and was published in the November 29, issue.&M;

Unlike most of the utilities we publish, CONFIG.CTL is a device driver that
you install in your CONFIG.SYS file.&P;  COMFIG.CTL will pop up a menu at boot
time that lets you choose all of the configuration options you care to set.&M;

It won't affect your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, though.&P;  DOS's batch language
provides all the statements you'd need to write an AUTOEXEC.BAT file that
will let you choose options before the boot procedure executes them.&P;  With
the batch file commands ERRORLEVEL and PAUSE you'd be able to write an
AUTOEXEC.BAT file that lets you choose your setup.&M;

If you don't feel up to writing such an AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you may want to
use the batch file one of our readers submitted to the User-to-User column
for the August 1990 issue.&M;

This batch file, RECONFIG.BAT, lets you choose among several CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT files; it will then reboot the system automatically, putting the
changes into effect immediately.&M;

You can download CONFIG.CTL or the August User-to-User column from PC MagNet.&O;
See page 8 of this issue for subscripton information.&M;

A SCREEN BLANKER&M;

FOR WINDOWS 3.0&M;

Before I acquired Windows 3.0, I used AutoMenu from Magee Enterprises to
organize and access my programs.&P;  It also had a screen-saver feature that
would blank the screen after a certain time had passed.&M;

Can you suggest a vendor that has such a program?&M;

John Hafey&M;

Cleveland, Ohio&M;

There are screen savers in two of the Windows utility toolkits sold by hDC in
Redmond, Wash.&P;  (206-885-5550).&M;

In hDC Windows Express, you get a screen saver that will blank the screen if
there's no activity for a minute.&M;

In hDC First Apps, you get a more sophisticated screen saver.&P;  You have a
choice of whether the monitor is completely blanked or whether a full-screen
graphic takes over.&P;  You can choose from several colorful graphics, including
some that are animated, or you can use a graphic of your choice, so it's
possible to display the company logo or even your own portrait, if it's in
BMP format.&M;

Also, the hDC First Apps screen saver lets you set the period of inactivity
and lets you install a password that will be required before the display
returns.&M;

ASK THE ADVISOR&M;

Send your questions to PC Advisor, One Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016 or
upload them to PC MagNet (see the instructions for joining on page 8 of this
issue).&P;  Sorry, but personal replies are not possible.&O;

floppy drive, 4Kbyte SRAM cache and 9-inch edge-lit liquid crystal
VGA.&P;  The LTE 386s/20 can use an 80387 math coprocessor, an
external VGA monitor and a PS/2-type mouse.&P;  A 9-pin serial port
and 25-pin parallel port are also included.&P;  An internal 2,400-bps
modem is available.&P;  The battery pack runs about 3 hours without
using the battery conservation features.&P;  The battery can be
recharged in 3 hours during use of the computer or 1.5 hours when
the computer is off.&P;  The cursor control keys are arranged with
the up key above the down key to the far right of the keyboard,
making the keys difficult to manipulate.&P;  The base configuration
costs $6,499 and weighs 7.5 pounds.&M;

Compaq's LTE 386s/20: Performance Worth the Price It ain't cheap or exactly
perfect, but if you need desktop power and expandability in a notebook
portable, the Compaq LTE 386s/20 is a difficult machine to pass up.&P;  Its most
obvious assets are its 20-MHz processor and 4K static-RAM cache, generous
10MB RAM capacity, 30MB standard-equipment hard disk and optional 60MB model,
9-inch, black-and-white VGA display, and its ability to accommodate a 20-MHz
80387 math coprocessor.&P;  As with earlier LTE models, the 386s/20 provides
battery-powered operation in excess of three hours, makes room for an
optional internal modem, and comes with plenty of I/O connectors and a
3.5-inch, 1.44MB floppy drive.&M;

Need a little more convincing before you pay the $6,499 base configuration
list price?&P;  As with most Compaq machines, the LTE 386s/20's strengths lie as
much with its sturdy feel, the polish and breadth of its documentation and
utilities, and its wide range of options as with its brute-force power and
performance.&M;

The LTE 386s/20 uses the same general form factor and styling as the LTE and
LTE/286, measuring 11 inches wide by 8.5 inches deep.&P;  This latest model
measures 0.35 inches thicker than previous LTE models (2.25 inches), and adds
a few unwelcome ounces as well.&P;  The base configuration machine weighs 7.5
pounds.&P;  Our evaluation unit, which included an 80387SX math coprocessor, a
third megabyte of RAM, and the internal 2,400-bps modem, weighed 7.75 pounds,
about half a pound heavier than a similarly equipped LTE/286.&M;

To keep battery life above three hours in this more-powerful LTE, the
removable nickel cadmium battery pack was beefed up by 0.2 pounds, to 1.7.&O;
Our evaluation unit ran for 3 hours and 8 minutes on the PC Labs battery
rundown test with all battery conservation features disabled.&P;  The LTE 386s
supports automatic component shutdown, system shutdown, and hard disk spin
down.&P;  The power brick, which weighs 1.4 pounds with cables attached,
recharges the battery in 1.5 hours when the machine is off and 3 hours when
it is in use.&M;

The display accounts for the increased chassis thickness as well as some of
the weight gain, but you won't mind.&P;  Developed by Citizen, the edge-lit
display measures nearly 40 percent larger than the CGA versions of previous
LTE models.&P;  It employs film-compensated supertwist LCD technology, the same
technology used in the excellent display of the Sharp PC-6220.&P;  Both displays
offer 640-by-480 resolution and 16-shade graphics.&P;  Side-by-side comparison
revealed differences but no certain winner: The Compaq was notably brighter
while the Sharp seemed slightly crisper and more homogeneous.&M;

The machine includes an external VGA monitor port which can be toggled as the
active display through use of a Ctrl-Alt key combination.&P;  Other standard
equipment connectors include a 9-pin serial port, a 25-pin parallel port, and
a PS/2-style mouse port.&P;  All ports reside behind a sturdy sliding panel.&O;
The optional 2,400-bps internal modem supports V.42bis, MNP 5 error
correction and data compression protocols, and provides dual jacks.&M;

The LTE 386s system board comes standard with 2MB of 80-nanosecond RAM, along
with the 4K four-way associative static RAM cache.&P;  A small compartment at
the left side of the machine allows quick installation of as many as two
credit card-sized RAM cards.&P;  These provide either 1MB or 4MB of 80-ns DRAM
for $549 and $2,199 respectively.&P;  Contrary to preintroduction rumors, these
60-pin cards provide dynamic RAM, not the nonvolatile storage of Intel's
68-pin, Flash EEPROM cards.&P;  Compaq reports that this 60-pin design is its
proposed standard for laptop DRAM expansion cards.&M;

There's also plenty of hard disk capacity--a 2.5-inch, 30MB hard disk or, for
an additional $500, a 60MB version.&P;  Both of these Conner Peripherals disks
carry a rated average random access time of under 19 milliseconds.&M;

Aside from its substantial weight, our only notable complaint with this
machine is its keyboard.&P;  The key mechanism is firm, but the keyboard layout
renders the cursor control keys nearly unusable.&P;  As with their other
laptops, Compaq arranged these four keys in a lazy L formation, with the Up
arrow key above the Down arrow key to the far right.&M;

All in all, it's difficult to see the Compaq LTE 386s/20 as anything but an
excellent machine, despite its heft and aggravating keyboard layout.&P;  If all
you need is a hard-disk-packing notebook portable, you may be better off with
a lighter, thinner, less-expensive machine.&P;  But if you need the combination
of power, performance, battery life, and expandability, the LTE 386s/20 is
your best choice.&O;

Turbo Vision Debuts in Turbo Pascal 6.0 Since the introduction of Turbo
Pascal in 1983, Borland has come out with a new and improved compiler almost
every year.&P;  The previous upgrade brought object-oriented programming to
Pascal.&P;  Now, the $149.95 Turbo Pascal 6.0 (TP6) gives us "event-driven"
programming in a complete application framework.&P;  This version is a far cry
from the one-disk original--its elegant Install program puts three megabytes
of files on your disk.&M;

The compiler itself hasn't changed much; all but a very few existing programs
will compile under the new version.&P;  The big news is that the IDE (Integrated
Development Environment) is now fully mouse-aware, with multiple movable
resizable windows and an interwindow cut-and-paste feature.&P;  Also BASM, the
new built-in assembler, eliminates the drudgery of counting bytes for INLINE
code, and the built-in debugger now has features that were previously found
only in the standalone Turbo Debugger.&P;  The built-in Debugger's new features
are specifically designed for debugging event-driven programs.&M;

Undoubtedly, Version 6.0's crowning glory is Turbo Vision, a library of
objects that comprise a complete application framework.&P;  You can think of an
application framework as the skeletal structure of a program without the
flesh.&P;  Your programming task is to add the program specifics to the
skeleton.&M;

Objects in the Turbo Vision library include character-based windows, pick
lists, scroll bars, menus, checkboxes, radio buttons--all the items that make
up a modern program.&P;  The event-driven style is similar to that of
Presentation Manager or Windows, though the compiler does not generate
Windows code.&M;

Turbo Vision is based on event handling, and not standard procedural
programming.&P;  All user input passes through the application's GetEvent
method, which interprets the input and generates, for example, a "KeyDown"
event.&P;  This event gets passed first to the main application's Handle-Event
method.&P;  If it can handle the event, it does so, performing some appropriate
action.&P;  If not, it passes the event to the selected object among its
subobjects.&P;  The subobject either handles the event or passes it along to its
selected subobject.&P;  There are also "broadcast" events that go to every
object and "message" events between objects.&M;

Turbo Vision objects automatically respond to certain common events.&P;  For
example, clicking on any window will bring it to the top of the window stack
and make it current.&P;  You can move a window by dragging its top edge, and
resize it by dragging the bottom right corner.&P;  And the nice part is that all
of this comes with no programming effort on your part.&M;

To write a Turbo Vision program, you initialize the necessary objects and
equip them to handle coming events.&P;  For example, the MenuBar object type is
built in; all you need to do is specify the captions for each menu option and
the command event to be generated when the user chooses that option.&M;

If you devise a specialized editing window, you simply give it the ability to
process particular editing keystrokes.&P;  You also get some "bonus" objects in
Turbo Vision: A clock, Rolodex, calendar, and calculator all come with source
code.&M;

The most significant change to the compiler itself is the introduction of
private fields and methods for objects.&P;  The new Private keyword makes the
specified fields and methods inaccessible outside of the current unit.&P;  In
strict object-oriented programming, you never access an object's data fields
directly--but before the existence of private fields and methods there was no
way to enforce this rule.&M;

Another new keyword, far, tells the compiler to make a particular procedure
or function FAR without affecting any other procedures.&P;  This is a big
improvement over the existing {$F+} and {$F-} directives.&P;  Other enhancements
include pointer constants, optional 80286 code generation, and fewer
restrictions on what sort of OBJ files can be linked into TP programs.&M;

The heap manager returns to the style of TP 3, allocating memory in chunks
rounded to 8 bytes.&P;  This granularity helps prevent heap fragmentation, but
it also may cause trouble in programs that depended on the specific behavior
of the heap manager.&M;

As with previous versions, a $299.95 Professional version of the package adds
Turbo Debugger, Turbo Assembler, and Turbo Profiler.&P;  Turbo Pascal
Professional also gives you a compiler that can make use of extended memory
to let you compile bigger programs.&P;  The TPCX command-line compiler doesn't
create protected-mode programs, but with a megabyte or more of extended
memory, it runs in protected mode.&M;

When Turbo C got its chic new IDE, Turbo Pascal users could only gnash their
teeth.&P;  Now TP 6 offers a thoroughly modern IDE--a CUA-compliant desktop with
multiple editing windows.&P;  Source code files are no longer limited to
64K--you can edit files up to a megabyte in size with up to 32,767 lines.&P;  As
a matter of fact, the entire IDE is written using Turbo Vision.&M;

If you like the IDE's dialog box for selecting a file, grab it from the Turbo
Vision library and incorporate it into your own program.&P;  Ditto the pull-down
menu system and other program elements.&P;  And if the new IDE doesn't do
everything you want it to you can use the macro compiler to create your own
hot-keyed commands.&M;

The new IDE stashes editor data and some system resources in extended memory,
if it's available.&P;  You might think that this would give you more RAM for
developing larger programs, but the fancy IDE has serious RAM costs.&P;  In
fact, you can't create substantially bigger programs than you could using the
older Version 5.5.&M;

If you've ever written a serious Interrupt Serice Rountine 1n old-style in
inline code you'll recall it wasa painfully task.&P;  Not only did you have to
either memorize or book up the bytes for each assembler opcode, you had to
laboriously count bytes for each JUMP statement.&P;  With BASM, you simply write
out the opcodes by name and define labels for jumps.&M;

There are minor limitations,  For example, you must only access variables
that ar local to the current scope or fully blogal.&P;  Still, it's a vast step
beyond INLINE code.&P;  Note also that BASM doesn't shell out to Turbo
Assembler; iit's built in.&M;

The art of built-in debugging takes a leap forward as well.&P;  For touchy
assembler routines, you can single-step through BASM cod--the new Registers
window keeps tract of what's going on in the CPU.&P;  Breakpoints have also
improved.&P;  In the past they were just plain dumb.&P;  Every time you reached a
breakpoint, execution would stop and you'd pop into the built-in debugger.&M;

Initially, only the standalone debugger had clever pass-count breakpoints
(break after passing the point a certain number of times) and conditional
breakpoints (break only if a certain condition is true).&P;  With TP6,
pass-count and conditional breakpoints are now built in.&P;  You can set a
breakpoint in a HandleEvent method to trigger only when it sees a mouse
event, or only on the 100th pass.&M;

In all Turbo Pascal users can stop lusting after the Turbo C's IDE--they've
got it!&P;  And they can stop counting INLINE bytes for time-critical functions
and use BASM instead.&P;  Finally, Turbo Vision makes it easy for any TP
programmer to write programs that look and feel professional.&P;  Sure, you've
barely recovered from absorbing object-oriented programming, and now Turbo
Vision's event-driven programming is another shock.&P;  But the technique is
worth learning, both for utility it offers in creating programs with a
standard user interface and for its similarity to the style of programming in
the popular GUI environments.&O;

After a False Start, R:BASE 3.1 Comes on Strong After a few less than
auspicious upgrades, R:BASE 3.1 looks good.&P;  When R:BASE 3.0 was released
(First Looks, June 26, 1990), it was justly criticized for its excessive
memory requirements, sluggishness, and lack of built-in EMS support.&O;
Microrim almost immediately announced the August release of 3.1, a free
upgrade from 3.0, to address these problems.&M;

In August, R:BASE 3.1 was released but then quickly pulled off the market and
back into beta, due to continuing memory problems.&P;  It has finally been
released after a two-month delay, and it delivers on almost everything
promised by Microrim.&P;  In addition, 3.1 has the ability to directly address
dBASE files (see sidebar).&M;

The most significant changes in R:BASE 3.1 are in the areas of speed, mouse
support, and memory management.&P;  Overall, this version is much more
responsive than 3.0--informal tests show that it is closer to its predecessor
(the original R:BASE for DOS) in speed.&P;  Mouse response has been improved as
well, with no discernible lag between clicking on a menu item and R:BASE's
execution of the selected action.&P;  The mouse can now also be used to lay out
fields when designing forms or reports.&M;

The biggest improvement is in memory usage; the minimum free memory required
by 3.1 is 450K, down from the 520K required by 3.0.&P;  Support for EMS 3.2 or
better is now standard, and on an 80286 or better processor, XMS memory can
be used as well (through either the supplied HINEM.SYS driver, or a 386/486
memory manager).&P;  Microrim also supplies a utility called RVMX.COM that lets
DOS access to up to 96K of the video memory on an EGA or VGA card.&P;  Using
this memory can crash some graphics applications, so access to it can be
toggled on and off.&M;

R:BASE 3.1's use of EMS is not entirely bug-free, however.&P;  On some systems
using Qualitas' 386MAX 5.0, 3.1 would refuse to load, exiting with an EMS
error.&P;  Microrim acknowledged the problem, attributing it to both the way
386MAX remaps memory, and the way 3.1 handles the ZIP function (which swaps
R:BASE out to EMS to execute a subprogram or DOS command).&P;  The support
technician I spoke with suggested using the"-R" command line switch, to avoid
the logo screen.&P;  This allowed 3.1 to load on a Northgate 386/20; however,
the program again crashed while trying to access a dBASE file.&P;  The
technician also suggested using teh NOCOMPROM parameter in 386MAX, but this
didn't solve the problem.&P;  On the same system using HIMEM.SYS and the EMS
driver provided with windows 3.0, and on a PS/2 Model 80 with 386MAX, 3.1
loaded and ran without problems.&M;

Microrim has also addressed some of the other complaints that users had about
R:BASE 3.0.&P;  Error handling has been improved, and error messages now appear
on the screen when output is being redirected to a printer or file.&P;  A pick
list now appears when you use the menu to change your working drive or
directory.&P;  Keyboard mapping has been extended to include Alt-function and
Alt-number keys.&P;  When you define a query, you can now save the screen layout
for future use in Browse/Edit screens.&M;

Overall, the improvements to R:BASE 3.1 are significant, and solve just about
all the problems exhibited by Version 3.0.&P;  Unless you are using 386MAX,
there is no longer any reason to hold off on upgrading from R:BASE for DOS.&O;

<SUMMARY>In Focus Systems Inc's $5,995 5000CX PC Viewer liquid crystal
display (LCD) projection panel is the best LCD panel available.&O;
The 5000CX can display almost 5,000 colors, 10 times more than
similar products.&P;  The 5000CX's Triple Super Twist Nematic (TSTN)
technology uses three different LCD layers and has a nearly 10 to
one contrast ratio.&P;  The panel has a cooling fan and a remote
control unit.&P;  A $199.95 breakout box allows the 5000CX and a
monitor to operate at the same time.&P;  The 5000CX's colors are
attractive and accurate, although shades of red are not perfect.&O;
Occasional vertical ghosts cause a vertical stripe to be washed
out by a lighter portion of the screen, but the adjusting the
controls minimized the ghost effect.&P;  The panel absorbs 94 percent
of the projector light, so a 650-watt projector is required.&M;

5,000 Colors from In Focus's $5,995 LCD Panel The 5000CX PC Viewer from In
Focus Systems is a $5,995 VGA-resolution LCD projection panel that
establishes a new standard for color projection displays.&P;  While panels are
still no match for traditional analog display devices (see sidebar), this one
comes closer to producing the full-color images we see on a typical monitor.&O;
The 5000CX is capable of producing nearly 5,000 diferent colors, according to
In Focus product specifications.&M;

The 7.5-pound panel uses TSTN (Triple Super Twist Nematic) technology, a
design developed and patented by In Focus Systems.&P;  The design uses thin
leaves of plastic on either side of each LCD layer to correct for color
shifts and to increase contrast.&P;  This replaces double-twist designs that use
more LCD layers, adding to the thickness of the panel.&M;

The 5000CX uses three of these separate LCD layers.&P;  These are colored cyan,
yellow, and magenta rather than the red, green, and the blue used in CRT
monitors.&P;  Because of this, and because LCD panels cannot produce as many
discrete shades as a minor, the projected colors do not always match the
monitor's image.&M;

The colors look great, however.&P;  There is an excellent balance between the
cyan, magenta, and yellow levels.&P;  Trim adjustments on the side of the panel
let you fine-tune the image.&P;  I found that it was difficult to improve on the
factory settings, however.&M;

With the 5000CX, blues were blue and yellows were vivid.&P;  Red shades tended
to be slightly off.&P;  Some pink and purple shades shifted to the red side of
the spectrum; light green shades were too dark.&P;  Despite this, the overall
effect was striking.&P;  In a few instances the panel had some trouble with
vertical ghosting: It displayed bands where a light part of the image washed
out a vertical stripe on the screen.&P;  But this effect could be minimized by
adjusting the picture controls.&M;

From a technical standpoint, the panel performed about as you would expect
from a highened projection panel.&P;  The contrast ratio was high: nearly 10 to
1.&P;  On the other hand, light absorption was also high: Despite the TSTN
design, the panel soaked up nearly 94 percent of the light from the
projector.&P;  Because of this, in Focus recommends using a projector with up to
650-watt ratings.&M;

The panel also features a built-in cooling fan, and the front panel controls
are duplicated on a remote control.&P;  The 5000CX supports signals from CGA,
EGA, and VGA adapters, as well as from the Macintosh.&P;  If you want to drive a
monitor at the same time as the panel, you will need the optional VGA
breakout box, which costs $199.95.&M;

For absolute top quality in a projected color image, you still need to go to
projection video, which can range in cost from about the same to a few
thousand dollars more than the 5000CX.&P;  Projectors are far less transportable
and more difficult to install and maintain.&P;  If color that is almost as good
as that on a monitor is good enough for you or you need a projection system
that is easily portable, the 5000CX is your best bet.&O;

<SUMMARY>Digital Research Inc's $595 Artline 2.0 offers a wide range of
features and drawing tools despite some limitations.&P;  Artline runs
under the Graphical Environment Manager (GEM) interface and
requires 505Kbytes of free RAM, and about 4Mbytes of disk space.&O;
Among Artline's vector-drawing functions are the new Sketch and
Quill tools, which use Bezier curves.&P;  Artline's bitmapped image
tracing allows trace sensitivity settings to be altered during
processing.&P;  Letters may be printed as vector outlines or
PostScript fonts.&P;  Artline cannot perform text handling functions
such as manual kerning.&P;  The plane tool, which edits Bezier
curves, is awkward, and the printer selection is limited.&P;  Artline

Artline: Heft for Illustrators, Ease-of-Use for Novices Common wisdom has it
that you can't be all things to all people, but Artline 2.0 very nearly
manages to be all things to all illustrators.&P;  This $595 GEM-based vector
drawing program from Digital Research lets novices easily create pictures.&O;
At the other end of the user spectrum, professional designers will
turbo-charge their work using the Color, Layer, Font, and Tool Manager menu
options.&M;

Twenty-one icons give instant access to most of Artline's vector-drawing
functions.&P;  You can create rectangles, lines, ellipses, curves, and freehand
shapes, as well as enter text in one of 35 scalable typefaces.&P;  Attributes
such as color or fountain fills, are assigned with a simple mouse click.&P;  And
tools that rotate, flip, and skew objects allow you to create special effects
effortlessly.&M;

Two brand new drawing tools--the Sketch and Quill--let you use Bezier curves.&O;
As you drag the sketching cursor around the screen, Artline automatically
fits the best curve to your rough drawing.&M;

The Quill function requires that you simultaneously create both a curve's
anchor point and its associated tangent control lines.&P;  While this approach
demands an understanding of how the direction and length of the tangents
affect the shape of a Bezier curve, the precision it affords is worth the
effort.&M;

Don't buy Artline for its text-handling capabilities.&P;  Although the program
can handle sophisticated effects like aligning text to a curved path, it
overlooks such essentials as manual kerning for display type.&M;

Do buy Artline for its unique approach to tracing bitmapped images.&P;  An
unusual feature allows you to interrupt a trace midstream and change the
sensitivity settings.&P;  This means that you can conserve memory (by having
fewer points and smoother curves for the simple portions of an image) while
maintaining accuracy.&M;

As well as all of the expected functions (such as copy or paste, and group or
merge), Artline's menus also offer advanced features.&P;  "Masking" clips an
overall pattern to the shape of another object, while the "blend" command
performs shape and color interpolations between two unlike objects.&M;

Unfortunately, the most important tool in Artline, the plane too--l which
allows you to edit Bezier curves--is plain annoying.&P;  In order to bring up
the plane tool's dialog box, for example, you must double-click somewhere on
the drawing screen away from the object itself.&P;  Half the time this deselects
the object altogether.&M;

The preset viewing levels seem restrictive until you realize that you can
create, save, and name a custom view of your drawing.&P;  The next time you load
the file, you can choose that view from the toolbox.&M;

The most powerful management functions of the program hide under an
innocuously named Options menu.&P;  Artline's Color Manager lets you develop
palettes (including graient fills) that can be saved and used with other
drawings.&P;  With the Layer Manager you can segregate specific portions of a
complex drawing in discrete, transparent, overlapping "pages."&P;  By displaying
only the pertinent layers you can vastly simplify the image editing process.&M;

The Font Manager lets you print letters using internal typefaces either as
vector outlines or as downloadable PostScript-compatible fonts.&P;  Also, you
can convert third-party typefaces from Bitstream, The Fontagrapher, and Adobe
to Artline's proprietary .AF4 format.&M;

The Tools Manager gives you the power to customize both the function and the
look of the toolbox.&P;  The Tool Manager comes complete with a (bitmapped only)
icon editor.&P;  New icons can be task-specific tools, like a stylus that only
draws dotted lines at a preset angle, or they can trigger a series of menu
commands and functions.&M;

Artline still runs under the Graphical Environment Manager, or GEM,
interface.&P;  However, in contrast to the traditional GEM applications, Artline
2.0 makes substantial demands on system resources.&P;  It requires 505K of free
RAM, 3.5 megs of disk space, and an additional 512K of disk space for swap
buffers.&P;  I couldn't run any TSRs along with Artline, and found screen
redraws to be intolerably slow unless I worked in wireframe mode.&P;  Expanded
memory should solve some of these performance problems.&M;

More troublesome than the GEM interface is the GEM file format.&P;  Don't
misunderstand; the GEM format handles sophisticated images and is compatible
with major applications.&P;  Artline, however, can only read files stored in
either .GEM or Adobe Illustrator .AI formats and can only export images to
.GEM or .EPS files.&P;  Real-world applications require .TIF, .CGM, and .WMF
files--none of which Artline can generate.&P;  Digital Research plans to bundle
the Hijaak translation utility with Artline 2.0.&P;  Registered users should
contact the company for more information.&M;

Although it does support industry standards, Artline comes with a limited
collection of printer drivers.&P;  You must use an awkward, separate menu to
output PostScript files.&P;  A thorough manual is some small compensation for
the total absence of on-line help.&M;

Legitimate criticisms notwithstanding, the new version of Artline can compete
with programs like CorelDRAW! or Arts and Letters Editor.&P;  If you are willing
to spend some time customizing the palettes and toolbox, you could make
Artline the application glove that fits your illustration hand.&O;

formatting is indicated by codes which can be deleted but not
restored by the Undo command.&P;  Only Ventura Publisher's
typographic controls are better than Legacy's.&P;  Legacy includes a

Legacy 3.0: Word Processing and Desktop Publishing In One Windows Package
Legacy 3.0--NBI's $495 document processing package--seizes the middle ground
between Windows-based word processors and desktop publishing programs.&P;  Its
combination of typographic features and formatting conveniences may make it
the document-production program you need unless you can't live with its minor
limitations.&M;

Legacy uses stylesheets for text formatting, and lets you edit text either in
WYSIWYG or draft mode.&P;  In WYSIWYG mode, Legacy is frame-based, like Ami
Professional or Ventura.&P;  Before you can enter text, tables, or graphics, you
create a frame.&P;  The frame can have customizable borders, colors, dimensions,
and links to other frames or use DDE links to other applications.&M;

When you link two or more frames, Legacy gives you unique formatting
features.&P;  For example, you can divide a table between two linked frames, and
have columns or rows spill automatically into the second frame.&P;  You can
superimpose frames to create irregular shapes, but you can't automatically
create irregular frames around imported graphics.&M;

An icon bar enables you to switch between editing text or graphics and
editing the frame that contains them.&P;  This icon bar somewhat resembles the
"ribbon" in World for Windows, but has a fuller set of tools.&P;  When you edit
graphics, for example, the icon bar replaces its text-formatting tools with
graphics tools for creating lines, arcs, and boxes.&M;

When you switch to draft mode, Legacy uses codes to mark off areas of
formatting.&P;  these codes can be searched or deleted.&P;  Unfortunately, the Undo
command won't restore a deleted code, and the draft mode font is ugly.&M;

Legacy's search-and-replace function lets you use wild cards in both the
search and replace string; a thesaurus with antonyms and definitions;
automated and customizable drop caps, and the most precise typographic
controls available on a PC short of Ventura's.&M;

Legacy's weaknesses include size (about 5MB of disk space), inability to open
two files at once, lack of macros, and limited keyboard shortcuts.&M;

If you struggled with NBI's ill-fated Windows 2.x document processor, Legend,
don't give up hope on the new one.&P;  Legacy has sleek menus and is faster.&O;
While it isn't as high-powered a word processor as Word for Windows or Ami
Professional, or as rich a desktop publishing program as PageMaker or
Ventura, it's the only Windows-based program that gives you most of the best
features of a word processor and a high-end DTP package.&O;

<SUMMARY>Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc's $299 ESP Dual Enhanced Serial
Port is an 8-bit serial communications board that can increase
throughput and improve data integrity during communications
sessions.&P;  The ESP uses the 16550 Universal Asynchronous Receiver
Transmitter (UART) to control data flow between the microprocessor
and the serial port.&P;  The UART's 16-byte buffer holds data until
the microprocessor is ready to process it.&P;  The ESP uses an 8031
processor for 1Kbyte bidirectional direct memory access (DMA) data
transfers at rates up to 57.6K-bps.&P;  The board's two 9-pin
communications ports can be designated COM1 through COM4.&P;  The
board supports the Enhanced Serial Interface (ESI) public domain
specification and will select the DMA mode when ESI-compliant
software is used.&P;  ESP is particularly useful in
interrupt-intensive operations.&M;

Hayes Enhanced Serial Port Breaks the Bottleneck You may have the fastest 486
PC and the latest V.32/V.42bis modem, but a hidden bottleneck could be
robbing you of all the throughput you paid for.&P;  PC serial ports often have
trouble handling data flow betwenn fast processors and modems.&P;  The $299
Hayes ESP Enhanced Serial Port card can eliminate data loss and enhance CPU
performance during communications sessions.&M;

The ESP takes advantage of the new 16550 UART (University Asynchronous
Receiver Transmitter), which controls the serial port.&P;  The 16550 UART offers
a 16-byte FIFO (first-in, first-out) buffer that mediates the flow of data
between the serial port and the CPU.&P;  (If your present UART is one of the few
ina socket, you can buy a 16550 for under $15 and make a direct replacement.)&O;
The 16550 acts like the older 16450 UART until the communications software
activates the FIFO buffer.&P;  Then incoming data is queued until the CPU can
accept it.&P;  Communications programs with 16550 compatibility include QMODEM,
ProComm Plus, Telix, and HyperAccess 5.&M;

The Hayes ESP card also provides an on-board 8031 processor for direct memory
access (DMA) data transfers.&P;  This allows 1K bidirectional data flow for bit
rates up to 57.6 Kbps.&P;  It supports the public domain Enhanced Serial
Interface (ESI) specification, allowing software support of high-speed data
transfers under DOS or OS/2.&M;

The ESP is a full-length, 8-bit serial card with two comm portS.&P;  It contains
two 16550 UARTs.&P;  DIP switches allow the ports to be assigned as COM1 through
COM4.&P;  The back of the board has two 9-pin RS-232C male connectors.&P;  The card
comes with an OS/2 driver and an installation program.&M;

Once installed, the board's operation is transparent.&P;  ESI-compliant software
automatically selects the DMA enhanced mode which takes advantage of the
ESP's microprocessor.&P;  Presently, the only fully ESI-compliant software is
Hayes's Smartcom Exec.&P;  Others should include ESI very soon.&M;

Preliminary testing showed the ESP's value in interrupt-intensive operations.&O;
In one series of tests, we had to slow down a 16450 UART board to 19,200-bps
port speed to complete V.32/V.42bis file transfers in a network environment.&O;
The ESP board easily completed the same tests at 38,400-bps port speed in the
FIFO mode.&P;  File transfers in the DMA mode were swift.&P;  With the ESP board
directly transferring data to memory, the CPU is free to do other tasks.&O;

WinComm Builds Beautiful Communications Scripts Synappsys' $149 WinComm
communications program for Windows 3.0 enters a crowded field, but it carves
out a niche for itself as the tool of choice for creating spectacular fron
ends for scripted communications.&P;  WinComm does this with three sets of
interface generators that offer support for graphics screens, a richer set of
dialog box tools, and graphics editors for dialog boxes and displays.&M;

WinComm's script commands can display Windows bitmaps (.BMPs)or metafiles
(.WMFs),and decorate them with hotspots and buttons.&P;  Scripts can call up
dialog boxes with edit boxes, radio buttons, and check boxes.&P;  WinComm
scripts have the unique capability to display file list boxes, drop-down list
boxes, and combo controls, and they also offer a complete implementation of
DDE.&M;

Two support programs allow you to generate code for WinComm applications
without directly writing it.&P;  A dialog editor lets you construct a dialog box
out of objects you choose from a menu.&P;  Once the box looks the way you want
it to, you send the underlying code (in WinComm's script language) to the
clipboard and paste it into your favorite editor.&P;  And you can paste back
from your editor to modify the dialog.&P;  The second support program, WCUTIL,
lets you display .BMPs and .WMFs on-screen, draw hotspots and buttons, add
help, and then paste the code to the clipboard.&M;

Added to the fron-end tools is support for file-transfer protocols and
terminal emulations.&P;  Supported protocols include X, Y, and Z modem,
CompuServe B, and Kermit.&P;  WinComm will resume interrupted CompuServe B and Z
modem transfers but it does not include a Kermit server mode.&M;

WinComm supports ANSI BBS, VT 52/100, and CumpuServe Vidtex.&P;  The Vidtex
support includes the ability to view .RLE graphics files on-line.&P;  Alas, .GIF
files--which have replaced .RLE in most places on CompuServe--do not have
this on-line support.&M;

Also included are a master/slave mode connection, and a phone dialer which is
limited when compared to packages like Hotline.&M;

The program has a few flaws.&P;  Some of the built-in dialog boxes have visual
bugs: The dialog box buttons don't line up in the dialer dialog box, and the
file list box in the Kermit-upload dialog box partially overwrites some of
the buttons.&M;

Given the broad functionality of the program, the documentation is ueven.&O;
You have to figure out large parts of the program by trial and error.&P;  The
effect of the sparse documentation is worsened by a limited manual index and
some nonintuitive points in the user interface.&P;  WCUTIL, for example, has no
file/New command.&P;  In lieu of this basic option, you must pick the single
submenu item on the fourth menu bar choice in order to start out.&M;

If you are a sophisticated user responsible for producing communications
scripts for a department or corporation, run out and get WinComm.&P;  Otherwise,
wait until some of the rough edges are smoothed.&P;  In any event, keep an eye
on what I find to be the most promising and intriguing Windows communication
program yet.&O;

Personics' Macro Editor/Debugger (MED) is a $199.95 add-in that threatens to
make 1-2-3 macro development fun.&P;  MED is a two-purpose tool.&P;  The debugger
tracks down problems and the editor fixes them.&P;  Since the editor lets you
create and modify range names by typing the names into cells, you can use it
to create new macros.&M;

MED occupies the lowe half of your screen.&P;  In debugger mode, it splits into
two windows--one showing the current code context, the other displaying the
status of watchpoint variables and the address of the current subroutine's
caller.&M;

F2 invokes the editor and up to three windows, allowing you to work with
range names, code, and comments at once.&M;

You can monitor up to four watchpoints and set nine breakpoints.&P;  The latter
can be of three types: "execute" (stop when execution comes to a particular
cell), "update" (stop when a particular cell's value changes), and
"conditional" (stop when a logical expression becomes true).&P;  You can attach
a count value to any breakpoint, so execution stops on the breakpoint's nth
occurrence.&M;

Macros can be traced in two step modes: one instruction at a time and one
cell at a time, or at nearly full speed.&P;  In either mode, you can jump
through loops at full speed.&P;  while tracing, MED's code window shows the
macro's next six instructions, even if they're in separate subroutines.&P;  Any
time execution is paused, you can move the pointer through your code to
restart at a new location.&P;  You can also invoke the editor, make changes, and
restart--all without leaving MED.&M;

On top of these (and other) services, MED provides comprehensive diagnostic
and informational messages.&P;  It will distinguish between the various types of
I/O errors, tell you when arguments are of the wrong type, and report typing
errors (such as missing parentheses) in simple English.&M;

If you do serious development in 1-2-3 2.x, MED will preserve the hair on
your head.&O;

</AUTHOR>
<SUMMARY>NCR Corp's $7,995 6436-0301 laser printer uses a Small Computer
Systems Interface (SCSI) to print graphics faster than any other
printer PC Labs has tested.&P;  The 6436 uses a Ricoh 4150 engine,
which is rated at 15 pages per minute (ppm).&P;  The 6436 does not
support PostScript, but it has HP LaserJet II emulation and 36
internal fonts in 7 typefaces.&P;  The SCSI and parallel ports can be
active simultaneously for access by multiple users.&P;  Although text
print speed is the same for the two ports, printing using the SCSI
port yields 4.4 graphics ppm, while using the parallel port
produces 2.8 graphics ppm.&P;  A device driver allows applications
that normally print through the parallel port to use the SCSI
port, but the driver is currently compatible only with the NCR
PC486/MC-25 microcomputer's Micro Channel Architecture SCSI
adapter.&P;  The printer will be an excellent choice when more
drivers are available.&M;

Blazing Speed: NCR's 6436-0301 SCSI Printer How many times have you sat at
your computer waiting, waiting, waiting for your laser printer to spit out a
full-page 300-dpi graphics image?&P;  While you can speed up the process (fast
computer, fast printer, print buffer), the biggest bottleneck is something
you can't control: the speed of the parallel port.&P;  NCR Corp. has done
something about the problem.&P;  With their 6436 SCSI printer, waiting for
graphics to print is an anachronism.&M;

Let's make no bones about it: The 6436 is the fastest printer ever to run the
PC Labs printer graphics speed test.&P;  While other fast printers hooked to the
parallel port have run at 2 graphics pages per minute, the 6436 zooms by
those slowpokes.&P;  It churns out 4.4 gppm running in HP LaserJet II emulation.&M;

This phenomenal throughput comes via a combination of the SCSI interface and
the Ricoh 4150 15-ppm laser engine.&P;  The NCR SCSI printer is based on the
same engine and similar design to the NCR G436-0501 (reviewed November 13,
1990), but exhibited none of its HP compatibility problems.&P;  However, the
6436-0501 offered optional PostScript compatibility; there is no such
capability available for the SCSI printer at this time.&M;

While it lacks PostScript support, it does have 36 resident internal fonts in
7 different typefaces.&P;  You can select any of the fonts as the default, but
unless you have an NCR 6436-0301 driver built into your application, you
cannot access them during a session.&M;

Another advantage the SCSI printer and all 6436 NCR printers enjoy is having
both interface ports active at the same time, allowing multiple users
simultaneous access.&P;  Output from the ports gets jogged to either side of the
output tray so that users can distinguish their print jobs from others'
output.&M;

Text output for the SCSI printer wasn't any faster through the SCSI port than
the parallel port.&P;  This suggests that the real advantage of the SCSI printer
comes into play when it's printing large graphics files or moving lots of
data from the CPU to the printer.&P;  Printing through the parallel port yielded
a graphics speed of 2.8 gppm, a full 1.6 gppm slower than the results using
the SCSI port.&M;

NCR supplies a device driver to support I/O for applications which normally
want to communicate through the parallel port.&P;  The driver deals with the
logical addressing the SCSI bus uses to communicate with the printer.&P;  But
this device driver must be specific to the SCSI host adapter to which you
connect the SCSI printer.&P;  Unfortunately, at this time, NCR only had the
device driver available for the MCA SCSI adapter in the NCR PC486/MC-25.&P;  NCR
plans to develop drivers for the popular SCSI adapters available for both MCA
and Isa systems.&M;

With a high-speed engine and multiple active ports, the 6436 is suitable for
workgroup applications.&P;  With the addition of the SCSI port, it handles large
graphics files with aplomb.&P;  When NCR writes drivers for the popular SCSI
interfaces, go out and find yourself one of these speed demons.&P;  It will make
waiting for print jobs nothing more than an unpleasant memory.&O;

Bernoulli's Shockproof Storage To Go Bernoulli hard disk technology relies on
a clever design: Flexible, removable storage disks are bent around the
read/write heads in the hard drive.&P;  Traditionally, Bernoulli boxes became
dedicated add-ons to a system.&P;  Now, this rather expensive, but ingenious
technology takes a step toward portability.&M;

The $1,399 Bernoulli Transportable from Iomega Corp. is housed in a rugged
plastic case made to withstand all the bumps and bruises of transit.&P;  At
12.38 pounds, and measuring 9,5 by 2.75 11 inches (HWD), the Transportable is
bulky enough that you probably won't want to transport it very far.&P;  But the
Transportable is a good alternative to sneaker-netting mammoth files from
station to station.&M;

The Transportable uses a SCSI interface.&P;  Since one of Iomega's visions for
the Transportable is as an office-wide backup device, the company includes
one SCSI interface board in each package, but sells additional boards for
$265 each.&P;  Iomega recently introduced a parallel port interface kit for
$199, but backing up through the parallel port takes longer.&M;

One thing you don't need to worry about is sturdiness.&P;  This unit is tough.&O;
Our informal tests proved that the Transportable and its media can take a
licking.&P;  We don't recommend Timexstyle abuse, but we dropped the 44MB
cartridge from a height of eight feet onto a hard tile floor--and recovered
the files without a problem.&M;

Iomega rates the mean time before failure at 60,000 hours and estimates the
service life at five years.&P;  The Transportable comes with a one-year
warranty; disks are covered for five years.&M;

The PC Labs DOS Disk Access and DOS File Access tests were run on a
Transportable connected via the SCSI card to a Compaq Deskpro 286.&P;  In
comparison to tests we ran two years ago on a Bernoulli Box II (see
"Removable Mass Storage," September 13, 1988), the Transportable is faster.&O;
It completed the DOS Disk Access and DOS File Access (Small Records) tests in
45.09 and 157.20 seconds respectively, compared to 69.06 and 191.85 scores
for the Bernoulli Box II.&P;  On the Large Records test, however, the
Transportable showed slightly slower time than the Box II.&M;

The Transportable is slower than the Compaq hard disk we used for testing.&O;
One way we improved its speed was to install its bundled disk caching
software, which is based on Multisoft's PC-Kwik cache.&P;  Also included are
Iomega's own RCD utilities for archiving, compression, and formating, a
specially prepared version of gazelle Systems Back-It, and Sitback
Technologies' SitBack for automated backup.&M;

Although high price is a factor, Bernoulli technology generally costs less
than optical disk storage.&P;  Its random access capabilities give it an
advantage over less-expensive tape backup solutions.&P;  While not as cheap as
tape backup, it offers Rambolike durability and reliable data backup.&O;

<SUMMARY>Folio Corp's $695 Folio Views 2.0 combines data base management
and utility program features to transform text files into indexed
databases.&P;  Views converts 41 native file formats into an
'infobase' of text files that are divided into paragraphs, pages

compressed.&P;  Each word in the text is indexed, and a search
utility allows word searches using wild card characters and
Boolean operators.&P;  Hypertext links within or between folios and
hot links with other programs can be established.&P;  Images in .PCX
format can be displayed in Folio Views 2.0, and RealSound audio
files are also supported.&M;

Folio Views 2.0 Brings New Capabilities to Infobases Folio Views 2.0 can turn
text files into an indexed database, create linked concepts within the
database, and add external links to graphics, animation, or audio.&P;  It's an
idea manager cum hypertext-authoring tool from Folio Corp.&M;

At the heart of Views is a conversion utility that works with 41 native file
formats.&P;  The conversion process creates an "infobase" of up to 1,000 text
files pasted together to accumulate up to two megabytes of information.&P;  An
infobase can also be built using Views' text editor.&M;

Views creates an index to every word--literally every word, even "the," "a,"
and "and," but Views' compression scheme can halve the size of these large
indexed files.&M;

During the conversion process, Views divides an infobase into idea-sized
chunks called folios.&P;  Folios can break at paragraphs, pages, or files, but
you can also customize folio breaks anywhere in the text file.&M;

Building an infobase is fairly quick, but exceptionally large infobases might
take hours to build.&P;  An 18K file took 57 seconds with the folio per
paragraph option.&M;

Once you've created an infobase, the real benefits begin to surface.&P;  Its
search utility utilizes three windows: one for words, which shows a list of
all the words in an infobase; one for results, which shows you the search
"hits"; and one where you build the search query.&P;  Query words are typed
directly or selected from a pick-list window.&P;  Wildcards and/or Boolean
connectors are permitted.&M;

Searching can be the first step to creating "groups"--relationships between
folios by topic.&P;  Tag commands allow you to mark, name, and search the group.&M;

Views can create hypertext links.&P;  Links, which appear as inverted triangles
on-screen, can help navigate a search query, folio, view (one screen of a
folio), tag, or group.&P;  Linking is useful for creating menus to your
infobase, tables of contents, or active footnotes.&M;

In addition to text links within or between infobases, you can hotlink to
other program.&P;  Views will automatically display the images from other
programs, provided they are in a .PCX file format.&P;  You can also link to a
spreadsheet, word processing document, or animation sequence.&P;  And Views has
built-in support for audio files in the RealSound format.&M;

Infobases can be read using a runtime version of the program.&P;  Building
infobases takes time--you have to be willing to adjust folios, build groups,
and embed links.&P;  But ideas acquire more value as you connect them together,
and Views lets you do this creatively.&O;

PKlite includes safety features to make uncompressed backups when
files are compressed or to return compressed files to their normal

$47 PKlite Compresses .COM and .EXE, Leaves Them Executable As the number and
size of application programs grows, disk space comes increasingly at a
premium.&P;  One space-saving solution is PKware's $47 file compression program,
PKlite.&P;  The program compresses .COM and .EXE files but leaves them
executable.&P;  Not only don't you need to extract the files, but they'll also
run without PKlite's being present.&P;  It does not compress files other than
.EXE and .COM files, but the compression algorithm it uses is based on its
predecessor, PKZIP's imploding algorithm.&M;

PKlite is a minuscule program, occupying less than 14K, and operates from the
DOS command line.&M;

To run it, you simplu enter the PKlite command at the prompt line, followed
by the file you want to compress.&P;  The program automatically skips over files
that aren't .COM or .EXE and also bypass files that won't benefit from the
compression process.&P;  If no options, arguments, or filenames have been
specified, a full-page help screen is displayed.&P;  For example, there are
arguments that let you use DOS wildcards to process groups of files.&M;

A single pas thrugh your drive with PKlite will reduce the size of executable
files with tight file compression--compression that can, on some files,
surpass the results of PKZIP and LHARC.&P;  The execution speed of compressed
programs remains unaffected, but the program loading may take from 2 to 5
seconds longer.&M;

PKlite has several safety features, including an option to create an
uncompressed backup copy and another option to expand files back into their
original form.&P;  These features can help you resurrect a file if compressing
it causes any problems.&M;

PKlite will also detect and bypass most programs that shouldn't be modified,
for example, .EXE files that relocate stacks, or programs that are altered
while running.&P;  It can miss detecting some programs that are self-modifying,
though.&M;

Iran PKlite on my catch-all utility directory containing several hundred
files.&P;  I also ran it on commercial applications including The Norton
Utilities, Mace Utilities, WordPerfect, Wordstar, and Lotus 1-2-3 and had
trouble only with a few files.&P;  Uncompressed, the WordPerfect 5.1 executable
is 220,627 bytes.&P;  The PKlite version of the executable is 162,900 bytes.&O;
Some of my programs wouldn't run after being compressed, but once I converted
these programs back to their original format they ran fine.&M;

It's been said that you can't squeeze blood from a stone, but for $47, PKlite
does a pretty good job of squeezing the most from your hard disk.&O;

Outside In: A TSR for Smart Data Import Outside In 1.0, from Systems
Compatibility Corp., is a TSR that lets you import data from most popular
word processing, spreadsheet, and database packages into your own word
processor--with a variety of formatting options.&P;  Priced at $99, the product
also comes in a five-user LAN version for $299.&P;  Its 72K RAM requirements
(53K using EMS) are not trivial, but because the program can mix and match so
many file formats, it may be worth the space.&M;

Outside In recognizes file formats from ore than 50 programs, and comes with
ready-to-use settings for 27 destination word processors.&P;  If yours isn't
there, fear not.&P;  You can define as many additional applications as you
need--several, even, for one word processor--or modify the existing ones.&O;
The latter option comes in handy if you sometimes perform import tasks (such
as comma-delimited data for mail merge) that require different settings from
those you normally use.&M;

Pressing Ctrl-I from within your word processor brings up Outside In.&P;  On the
left side of the display, you'll notice a file listing of either the default
directory or one you select.&P;  Scroll down the list and you'll see, in Outside
In's document viewing window, the contents of any file in a supported format.&M;

If you need a better look at the file, pressing F2 zooms the display to cover
the file-listing window.&P;  You can enlarge your view further by toggling off
the function-key template on the bottom of the screen.&P;  Once you've displayed
the file you wish to import, the Tab key toggles you into the document
viewing window.&M;

Outside In offers a number of options for selecting data.&P;  First, you can
highlight the whole file.&P;  Hitting the Ins key copies the data in your word
processor and plops it into a spot you chose earlier.&P;  If you're importing
spreadsheet data, you can define horizintal and vertical ranges
(noncontiguous if you like) and bring in the intersecting cells.&P;  Other
highlighting options include line, user-defined block, and text string.&M;

The program translates only a word processor's most elementary formatting
codes into those of your own.&P;  But if you want, say, underlined text from
your source file to appear in a different font in your word processor, you
can tell Outside in to issue the command to switch fonts in the target
document instead of the command that your word processor normally uses to
underline.&M;

There are plenty more ways to customize Outside In.&P;  A paragraph, for
instance, can be imported "as is" or stripped of carriage returns--quite the
godsend for e-mail users.&P;  You'll probably need to practice with spreadsheet
or database files (and set your word processor appropriately) to ensure that
imported columns or fields align properly.&M;

One missing feature is a way to save an application's setup file under a new
name for those times when you want most, but not all, of your program's usual
settings for a particular task.&P;  Outside In also requires some time
investment to configure it properly for your own needs.&P;  Once set up,
however, the program's smooth operation and helpful documentation may make
you forget you ever had problems with format incompatibilities.&O;

MLAB: Quick and Easy Data Analysis for Scientists MLAB (the "M" stands for
modeling) has something in common with other mathematical models such as
Mathematica, but what sets it apart from the others is its painless way of
matching data to models while fitting parameters.&P;  This $3,000 program from
Civilized Software will be especially interesting for researchers in the
biological, social, and experimental physical sciences, as well as some
engineers.&M;

MLAB's simple operation lets you enter one or more equations containing
variables and unknown parameters.&P;  You specify sets of data for the
variables, either from an ASCII file or by direct manual input.&P;  You then
enter the command FIT and sit back as MLAB finds the best values of the
parameters to fit the data--the default is to use a least square fit
algorithm.&P;  The program then makes a simple text report of the values of the
parameters, although you can then graph the results, provided the equation
has only one independent variable.&M;

While many packages are capable of handling linear regressions, they are
restricted to creating models that have linear dependence on the variables.&O;
Unlike most competing products, MLAB handles nonlinear equations.&P;  A few
other PC packages, such as the $249 MINSQ (Micromath, P.O. Box 21550, Salt
Lake City, UT 84121; 800-942-6284), also have general nonlinear parameter
fitting, but only MLAB can fit models with differential or finite difference
equations.&M;

For any given problem, you could probably duplicate MLAB's ability with
programs such as Gauss or Mathematica, but you'd need to rely on numerical
analysis and serious programming.&P;  In contrast, MLAB is automated.&P;  MLAB's
programming statements are few.&P;  For example, there are straightforward
if-then and for programming constructs.&P;  In addition, MLAB supplements its
critical functionality with the largest array of special functions I have
ever seen in a math toolbox including scientific (e.g.&P;  Bessel, elliptic, and
ERF), probabilistic (e.g.&P;  chi squared), statistical (e.g.&P;  kurtosis), signal
processing, and cluster analysis.&M;

Graphics are limited to two dimensions but include graphs such as contour
projections of surface areas.&P;  The program supports output from HP LaserJets
and PostScript printers.&M;

The interface is rather poor; it uses a look and feel once common in the
mainframe world, where MLAB has its origins.&P;  Under normal circumstances, the
only editing key is the backspace, although you can shift into a built-in
line editor.&P;  Here, you can access the last command you enter, but that's
all.&P;  Anything that scrolls off the screen is gone forever.&M;

MLAB is copy protected using a parallel port dongle.&P;  It does not get along
well with TSRs, and the manual warns that it does not work with many
networks.&M;

In a world where Mathematica, Gauss, and Maple are each available for under
$1,000, MLAB's price seems excessive, especially when you consider its poor
interface, lack of Lotus 1-2-3 import, and its copy protection.&P;  Yet despite
these shortcomings, if you need to do a best fit of data where you have
unknown parameters, MLAB is likely to become central to your work.&O;

New &amp; Improved&M;

Sixteen&M;

Pages-Per-Minute&M;

Postcripts From TI&M;

Texas Instruments' microLaser XL series of small footprint upgradable
PostScript printers promise an output of up to 16 pages per minute.&O;
Measuring 10.8 by 15.8 by 16.6 inches (HWD), the microLaser XL ships in three
models: the standard XL with HP LaserJet Series II emulation and 500K RAM;
the XL PS17 with the Adobe PostCript interpreter, 17 scalable fonts and 1.5MB
RAM; and the XL PS35 with 35 PostCript fonts.&P;  Other features include the
ability to store up to four user-definable printer configurations, a total
RAM capacity up to 4.5 MB, one parallel port (a Serial/Apple Talk port is a
$145 option), a 250-sheet internal paper drawer, and the ability to print a
variety of paper types such as letter, legal, half-letter, transparencies,
and labels.&M;

The microLaser XL also includes a 16-character LCD which displays words or
abbreviations rather than codes to let users select fonts, paper drawers, ang
page orientation.&P;  An optional 500-sheet paper tray will expand print
capacity to 750 pages without refilling.&P;  Since the optional PostScript
boards piggyback onto the XL countroller board, the standard XL model can be
upgraded to PostCript in the field.&P;  Texas Instruments claims that the
microLaser XL will handle 25,000 pages per month, and the printer ships with
a one-year warranty.&M;

Upgradable Micro&M;

Channel from ALR&M;

Advanced Logic Research introduces the Modular Processor System (MPS), an
upgradable Micro Channel 386.&P;  Starting at $1,995 for a 33-MHz 386 featuring
a 16K Smart Cache and 32-bit bus-mastering capabilities, the system is
upgradable to a 25- or 33-MHz 486.&P;  The base configuration includes 1MB RAM,
with memory expandable to 49MB, one high-density 3.5-inch floppy disk drive
(the system suports a total of four 3.5-inch storage devices), a 150-watt
power supply, eight expansion slots including four 16-bit MCA, two 32-bit
MCA, and two proprietary slots for CPU and the memory expansion.&P;  The ALR
Micro Channel-compatible VGA adapter is a required option that will add $300
to the quoted price.&P;  The system measures 6 by 15 by 17 inches (HWD), weighs
35 pounds, and ships standard with a one-year warranty.&M;

Training Wheels&M;

For Windows&M;

The Microsoft Productivity Pack is designed to help users work better with
Windows 3.0.&P;  The package offers three modules: Learning Windows, Working
Smarter, and Quick Troubleshooter.&M;

The Learning Windows module is an interactive tutorial offering lessons in
several categories including: Getting Started, Windows Essentials, Working
with Applications, File Management, and Program Manager.&M;

Working Smarter provides 45 tips on how to do things faster and easier.&P;  The
program teaches users how to switch efficiently between applications, create
a RAM drive, and more.&M;

The Quick Troubleshooter is designed to simulate a technical support call by
walking the user through the problems.&P;  Users learn basic problem solving
like what to do if their printer won't print, or more-advanced problem
solving such as how to create or delete a swapfile in 386 enhanced mode.&P;  The
information in the Troubleshooter is cross-referenced so the user can go as
deeply into the information as he orshe wants go.&M;

Microsoft has also begun shipping The Microsoft Office for Windows.&P;  This
package combines three of the company's business applications for Windows
3.0.&P;  Included in the package are Microsoft Excel (spreadsheet), Word for
Windows (word processor), and Microsoft PowerPoint (presentation graphics
program).&P;  The Microsoft Office contains disks and documentation for all
three products, and a new manual designed to instruct users on how to use the
applications together most effectively.&P;  The suggested retail price for The
Microsoft Office for Windows is $995.&M;

DOS Window For Unix&M;

For SPARCstation users who need access to DOS applications.&P;  Insignia
Solutions has announced a program that emulates an IBM PC AT.&P;  SoftPC enables
users to run multiple DOS sessions on a single SPARCstation.&P;  The program
runs under SunOS and takes advantage of SunOS features while also providing
all the features of DOS 3.3.&P;  A freeze feature lets a Sun workstation user
place the SunOS application on hold, then run a DOS application.&P;  SoftPC's
file-sharing architecture handles text file conversions between SunOS and
DOS, thus making any Unix directory appear in the MS-DOS environment.&O;
Multiple SoftPC windows can run concurrently, and SoftPC supports LIM memory
expansion, allowing users to access up to 4MB of memory.&M;

Six New V.42bis&M;

Modems from GVC&M;

GVC Technologies announces six modems that incorporate the latest V.42bis
data compression at an affordable price.&P;  The SM-96 is a $699 external
desktop V.32/V.42 9,600-bps modem with V.42bis data compression and MNP Level
5 error correction.&P;  The intenal half-card SM-96H has the same features as
the SM-96 but lists for $629.&P;  The $299 FM-9624 (desktop) and the $259
FM-9624H (internal) fax modems feature a 9,600-bps send/receive fax and
2,400-bps data modem.&P;  For laptop users, the $271 MM-24V pocket-sized modem
features V.42bis and MNP Level 5 at speeds up to 9,600 bps.&P;  The SM-96S is an
$899 desktop modem that features extended leased line support, allowing
communication over 2-and 4-wire leased lines.&P;  The SM-96S features phone
jacks for dial-up, leased line, and telephone connections.&M;

WYSIWYG MATH&M;

Processing&M;

Design science has introduced a PC version of its mathematical equation
editor.&P;  Running under Microsoft Windows, MathType allows users to build
mathematical equations using standard point and click techniques.&P;  For each
basic mathematical construct (such as fractions or integrals), MathType
provides a template consisting of symbols and empty slots.&P;  Users select on
-screen icons and fill in the slots to build equations.&P;  MathType provides
120 templates and over 150 mathematical symbols.&P;  Users can save up to 32
macros, select fonts, and can adjust size, spacing, and position of
charactes.&P;  Equations may be transferred to the Windows clipboard or saved as
an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file with TIFF or Windows Graphics Metafile
(WMF) screen graphics, or as an Aldus Placeable Metafile.&P;  MathType supports
Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), and includes macros designed to form a seamless
interface with WYSIWYG word processors such as Word for Windows and Ami
Professional.&P;  Design Science also promises that MathType will work with any
Windows-based word processing/page layout program, and with programs that
accept.&P;  EPS files, such as WordPerfect 5.0, Microsoft Word 5.0, Xerox
Ventura Publisher, and IBM Interleaf Publisher.&M;

Utility Gets a Grip on&M;

Your Graphics&M;

Operating on the theory that a Rolodex is sometimes faster than a computer,
Market Street Software announces Grip, a graphics management utility that
allows users to create 3- by 5-inch image card files.&P;  But that's only one
feature within Grip's grasp.&P;  Grip also allows users to capture screens to
the .PCX format, view graphics images on-line, and, as claimed by the
manufacturer, to print each image in less than 10 seconds.&P;  Users can print
in four sizes: thumbnail--fifteen per page; four per page (with ID
information included); one per page; or to Grip-dex (three Rolodex-sized
images per page).&P;  Users may also manipulate color and images, as well as
print images as binary files or with an Image Index of specific graphics
information such as standard DOS information, image mode, and resolution.&O;
Grip retails for $89.95.&M;

New Program&M;

Brings Graphics&M;

To Accounting&M;

Evolve, a new Windows-based financial analysis tool from Absolute Solutions
brings graphical power to any accounting package.&P;  Evolve promises to
transform data from your accounting package into flexible financial
statements, business ratios, budgets, cash flow reports, charts, and graphs.&O;
Integrated with Microsoft Excel, Evolve operates in the Windows 3.0
environment, transforming the data into the Evolve format.&P;  Users can
accumulate accounting data from one month up to five years, then view it,
display it, prepare financial statements for auditors, or even output to tax
programs such as Softview's Taxview.&M;

New PIM for&M;

Project Managers&M;

Time/Design's personal information manager is geared toward professionals
managing projects, people, and plans.&P;  Based on Chronos Software's
Who-What-When software, TimeBase allows users to schedule, prioritize, and
delegate multiple activities, as well as follow-up on a variety of projects.&O;
timeBase's project management features include project tracking, Gantt
charts, milestone, resource-leveling, and deadlines.&M;

Other features include a DOS gate allowing users to move directly to other
applications; the ability to cross-reference activities and contacts; a
telephone/address directory with auto-dialer, mail list manager, and mailing
label generator; a memo processor; popup calendar; to-do lists; alarm clock;
and calculator.&P;  Users can print out the 14 included report types.&M;

TimeBasic's information can also be printed to small-format paper for use
with Time/Design's paper-based Management System.&O;

UPGRADE YOUR IBM COMPATIBLE AND SAVE A BUNDLE&M;

Maximizing the Home&M;

PC Office&M;

Upgrade your IBM Compatible and Save a Bundle answers the question in the
back of many peoples' minds: "What am I going to do with this old machine?"&O;
For those who want something new but balk at the price, or for the users who
craves something as fast as his machine at work, Aubrey Pilgrim offers a
simple solution--upgrade.&M;

Pilgrim's book offers helpful insights, good illustrations, and well-reasoned
explanations.&P;  Pilgrim does not automatically suggest that everyone upgrade
to a 386; rather, users are encouraged to examine the reasons why they need
to upgrade, including both their needs and their budget.&P;  Every aspect is
covered: Pilgrim even provides tips for picking up used equipmwnt, a path for
upgrading not considered by manu users.&M;

Each chapter and its attendant subsections devoted to particular components
of the machine are liberally and clearly illustrated.&P;  However, the
experienced user might find that Pilgrim's book plods along and covers
already well-traveled ground.&M;

One good point is that Pilgrim pays close attention to those portions of the
machine that typically receive little credit for their contribution.&P;  His
section on BIOS, for instance, is as clear and helpful as you'll find
anywhere, and the work he does describing the inner working of devices like
hard disks or the different types of RAM are worth nearly everyone's time.&O;
Video upgrades are handled adroitly here too.&M;

Pilgrim is a Los Angeles-based write, and his bias toward the southern
California area is readily apparent.&P;  When he suggest specific stores and
outlets to obtain various components, most of them are found in California.&O;
But Pilgrim also provides a list of free and subscription-based publications,
as well as a listing of on-line services.&M;

This book appeals on many different levels.&P;  For technical novices, the
book's this-is-a-disk-drive approach may prove to be their salvation, while
for more-experienced users, it may be too simple, though handy to have on a
bookshelf.&P;  As a reference for any user, though, this book will provide to be
invaluable.&O;

THE HOME OFFICE BOOK Setting up and maintaining a home office presents all
sorts of challenges.&P;  Suddenly you're a person with many hats--the one
responsible for making decisions regarding all facets of office life--from
furniture to faxes, from couches to computers.&P;  The Home Office Book from
Mark Alvarez is a chatty, quick read that's designed for the home office
neophyte.&P;  It takes you through the building blocks of the generic home
office including computers, softwares.&P;  furnitures, and room design.&M;

Alvarez brings two-fold expertise to the book.&P;  He's worked for a number of
house and home publications, and he's been a home office worker for more than
a decade.&P;  He brings an aesthetic, practical knowledge of space to his
discussions of the home office environment, and he quickly illustrates the
trade-offs involved in setting up shop.&P;  Alvarez is at his best when he's
describing the various modular furniture offerings available.&M;

Alvarez then proceeds to dive into the computer age.&P;  His chapters on which
computers and software to buy are concise and to the point.&P;  At the risk of
presenting just enough information to make you dangerous, Alvarez tells you
what you need to know to make an intelligent buying decision regarding
computers, software, and peripherals.&P;  The no-nonsense advice (an SX is a
good buy, consider an integrated package or shareware) is sane and tame, but
without much detailed explanation behind the dictums.&P;  I wouldn't make a
buying decision based on the book's information; use it instead as a
springboard for further investigation.&M;

Maxims such as "stay away from release 1.0" of any software are gems that
novices might not think of, but for the most part the book is a highly
readable rehash of computer basics.&P;  Interesting sidebars on topics such as
PostScripts, shareware, and on-line services offer slightly more depth.&M;

Alvarez moves onto those tough office purchases: fax, phone, and other
hi-tech alternatives such as PC voce mail.&P;  Chapters on how to design and
light your office (as well as arranging the stuff you brought) offer good
summaries of the alternatives.&P;  Finally, a chapter that includes issues such
a taxes and loneliness demonstrate a clear understanding of home office
issues.&M;

Whether you're just beginning or already operate a home office, reading this
book is like commiserating with a friend.&P;  Alvarez has obviously done his
time in the home office.&P;  My greatest concern is that the book diverts
attention from the real issues.&P;  Your furniture, room design, and even your
PC are cosmetic accoutrements.&P;  Without a solid business idea and good sense,
you'll quickly wind up back at the corporate water cooler.&O;

Pipeline After sitting out much of the PC revolution, Kodak has finally
decided to get involved in it in a big way.&M;

Two issues ago, I detailed how their Photo CD system--which puts ordinary
35-mm.&P;  photographs on compact disk--had major implications for graphics on
PCs (November 27, 1990).&M;

Now, even though Photo CD is still over a year away, Kodak is making an
attempt to take a leadership role in defining how color photographs are
displayed, stored, and printed.&M;

Right now, major problems confront anyone trying to publish color documents
with a PC or workstation.&M;

Color software on a PC offers lots of tools for fiddling with hues and tones
of images after they've been scanned, but without a color-image
specification, you can't get a reliable reproduction of the screen image.&O;
None of the devices are calibrated to the same color definitions.&M;

Today, a designer who uses a paint program to carefully edit the colors in a
scanned-in photo can be horrified to find the wrong colors printed after
intermediary software has converted the file for the separation process.&M;

Adobe's PostCript has become the common page description language that
connects PCs and dedicated page-composition systems in producing
black-and-white publications, but there's still no common ground for printing
color images.&M;

Adobe is in the process of perfecting color extensions to PostScript but it
needs a way to define how photographs will be addressed ad stored.&M;

Kodak is proposing just that: a device-independent color management system
that can represent millions of colors and has built-in compression
algorithms.&P;  It's only in its first stages of public discussion and has not
been fully detailed, but it has the potential to bcome a solution across all
computer platforms.&P;  Adobe, Aldus, Apple, IBM, and Sun are among the
technology's initial supporters.&M;

Adobe is very enthusiastic about Kodak's proposal; in fact, the two companies
have been working closely in developing the specifications.&M;

The Kodak color system is made up of a group of software products that will
enable programmers to calibrate existing software and hardware to
specification being called PhotoYCC.&P;  The term PhotoYCC is not strictly an
acronym; it's an amalgamation of the way broadcasters and photographers refer
to image reproduction: the Y implies luminescence (the gray level) and the
two C's together represent chrominance (the hue and saturation level).&M;

There will be software tools to give programmers access to the PhotoYCC model
from whichever standard their products currently use: the RGB
(red-green-blue) standard used for displays, the CMYK
(cyanmagenta-yellow-black) system used by printers, or any of the CIE color
space models.&M;

Of course, Kodak's Photo CD system will be fully compatible with this new
system.&M;

With only Photo CD and software libraries to sell, and long experience in
color reproduction, Kodak may prove to be exactly the right company to
establish this standard.&P;  for Kodak, new business development is a top
priority, since it had to withdraw from the instant-camera business.&M;

And for Adobe, the emergence of a new standard for storing and retrieving
color images is added insurance that PostScript 2 will finally bridge the gap
between what you see on a color screen and what you get on printed paper.&M;

HOLD ONTO YOUR HAT:&M;

INTEL'S STARTING TO TALK&M;

ABOUT THE 586&M;

Intel may be in the driver's seat for PC microprocessor design, but it's
acting like the competition is breathing down its neck.&M;

The company said it plans to ship the first 586 chips in 1992, although it
isn't yet prepared to say how the next microprocessor will top the 486.&M;

For the past year, Intel has solicited the opinions of designers at the
leading PC manufacturers on the types of features they'd like to see in the
586.&M;

Intel's chief executive Andrew Grove has said he feels that Intel needs to be
more aggressive in its development of faster versions of the 486 and in its
revisions to the line.&P;  Intel president David House recently confirmed that
Intel plans to produce a 50-MHz version of the 486 in 1991.&P;  He also believes
that the 486 will eventually replace the 386 as the company's leading
microprocessor.&M;

To help reach that goal, Intel's stepped up its marketing campaign for the
486.&M;

PARADOX SALES SURPASS&M;

BOTH VERSIONS OF&M;

dBASE III+ And IV&M;

Paradox has been steadily gaining popularity in recent years and it may
finally be on the verge of emerging as the leading database manager for PCs.&M;

Computer Intelligence, in La Jolla, Calif., tracks the software bought by
large companies.&P;  For the month of September, 1990, Paradox beat the combined
sales of dBASE III Plus and dBASE IV by ten percentage points, with 44
percent of the market, compared to dBASE'S combined total of 34.&M;

Paradox's sales to big companies have climbed dramatically over the last six
months, while Ashton-Tate continued to hold onto the biggest share of the
total market with its two versions of dBASE.&P;  By September, however, Paradox
overtook the two for the first time.&M;

DataEase International's DataEase also made strong sales gains in recent
months, reaching 12 percent of the total market for September.&P;  R:BASE,
SMART, and FoxBase maintained their positions in the secondary level with
shares of about three percent each.&M;

OSF DELIVERS THE GOODS;&M;

NOW IT'S UP TO THE&M;

MARKET&M;

After a closely watched development cycle, the Ope Software Foundation
finally finished the operating system that is supposed to change the course
of Unix: OSF/1.&M;

Most of the foundation's sponsors vowed to integrate OSF/1 with the current
versions of Unix in their product lines over the coming months.&M;

IBM said that it intends to base future versions of AIX on OSF/1, covering
systems from the PS/2 up to the 3090.&M;

Hewlett-Packard gave a more candid explanation of its strategy.&P;  Chief
executive Dean Morton said, "HP's first step in demonstrating our commitment
to OSF/1 will be to put it on the RISC workstations we'll be shipping next
year.&M;

"Our goal is to get the maximum acceptance of OSF/1 by putting it on our
hottest workstation product.&P;  Then, as soon as possible, we'll migrate the
rest of our workstation and multiuser systems that currently run our HP-UX
and DOMAIN operating systems to the OSF technology base."&M;

DEC said it will base the next version of ULTRIX on OSF/1 and will ship a
merged ULTRIX-OSF/1 product within a year.&M;

NCR MAKES NEWWAVE A&M;

MAJOR PART OF ITS&M;

ENTERPRISE-SIDE LINE&M;

NCR has an ambitious plan to develop modular systems that can handle a
corporation's computing needs at every level.&P;  Called Cooperation, it's
designed to be a fully open system with access to all the major environments,
from LANs to WANs to minis to mainframes.&M;

But one of the more interesting aspects is NCR's choice of NewWave, the
object-oriented extensions to Windows that Hewlett-Packard developed.&M;

Large Systems vendors need some kind of graphical front end that can simplify
the sophisticated back-end communications chores.&P;  IBM developed OfficeVision
as a proprietary derivation of OS/2.&M;

HP is on the same track with NewWave and the fact that NCR is willing to
adapt NewWave for its emerging platform says a lot about both companies'
interest in open systems.&M;

With Unix users still trying to wrest control of that operating system away
from AT&amp;T, cooperation between companies like NCR and HP on NewWave is like a
breath of fresh air.&P;  In spite of the potential for IBM and Microsoft to
restrict growth with their control of PC operating systems, the reality seems
to be that the DOS-OS/2 environment provides strong opportunities for growth.&O;
And they didn't even have to form a committee to do it.&M;

TRAVELING SOFTWARE TEAMS UP&M;

WITH HDC TO DEVELOP WINDOWS&M;

FILE-TRANSFER SOFTWARE&M;

Strategic alliances aren't just for big companies.&M;

The leaders in file-transfer and windows utilities have gotten together on a
technology-sharing arrangement.&M;

Traveling Software contributed its Win-Connect utility to hDC for inclusion
in a new group of ile utilities called FileApps, and Traveling Software will
include an hDC utility, File Enhancer, in WinConnect, a file-transfer program
that runs under Windows.&M;

hDC's development kit for Windows programming is credited by both parties as
the key that made this technology transfer work.&M;

Development tools for Windows have suddenly become a growth industry; about
half a dozen new companies are planning products.&M;

Whitewater Group, which was the first company to sell Windows tools, has
taken the concept a step further: it's created a fast-track program where
programmers can spend two weeks at Whitewater's offices, taking advantage of
all the code and brainpower Whitewater has,to get a Windows application
running.&O;

<SUMMARY>Coinages proliferate in the computer industry and many definitions
are incorrect.&P;  Hackers once referred to innocuous individuals
pursuing the intricacies of the processor, the operating system or
the application until the popular press discovered a group of
hacker-like people who were breaking into other computers with
malicious intent.&P;  Former hackers are now known as adopters or
pioneers.&P;  Edutainment is a coinage that attempts to convey the
sense that software for children can be both educational and
entertaining.&P;  Entertaining educational programs are the exception
to the rule, yet enhanced capabilities of hardware may help
salvage the respectability of this kind os software.&P;  Intel's
80486 is really a 386DX with a math coprocessor and some cache; it
should have been named the 386MX.&P;  Multimedia refers to extended
video and audio performance coupled with a CD-ROM player.&M;

What's in A Name? Apart from the bafflegab, technolobabble, and gobbledygook
we're subjected to daily in this business, some of the common definitions are
just plain wrong.&P;  It's too late to save some of them; for others there may
be hope.&M;

The hacker, for example.&P;  This word once described a person utterly dedicated
to understanding and applying the underlying technology of hardware or
software--someone who was not afraid to pick up a soldering iron and build
something from scratch.&M;

The first hackers didn't ear, drink, or sleep in their quest for perfect
understanding of the processor, the operating system, or the application.&O;
But the popular press stumbled across a criminal subspecies of hacker-like
people who were breaking into other computers and sometimes wreaking havoc.&O;
In the ensuing articles, the original definition of the word was
irretrievably lost.&P;  I used to be a hacker.&P;  Now I'm an early adopter or a
pioneer or something.&P;  It's just not the same.&M;

Edutainment&M;

This recent coinage was founded on the thesis that educational software is
inherently boring, while entertainment software is inherently worthless.&O;
Edutainment hopes to convey the sense that software for children can be
educational and entertaining at the same time.&P;  One critic sniffed that "the
word edutainment was coined by someone who obviously knew nothing about
either."&P;  I'm not so sure that's true; I've seen worthy examples of
entertaining, educational programs, such as the Carmen Sandiego collection.&M;

The Learning Company's Sharyn Fitzpatrick offers an exceptionally levelheaded
counter-definition to edutainment: children's software.&P;  The implication, of
course, is that it all should be this good.&P;  The cold fact of the moment is
that it isn't.&P;  The advent of computers with higher video resolution and
infinitely superior sound will make these programs far more engaging and
therefore more educational.&P;  The capabilities offered by the new hardware may
just salvage the respectability of both educational and entertainment
software, obviating the need for a new word.&M;

80486&M;

What's this doing on the list?&P;  It's my contention (and I'm not the only one)
that the 80486 is an utter misnomer.&P;  In earlier examples of Intel
"hundreds-level" revisions, there have been major enhancement to the chip's
addressing capabiliites and changes in the instruction set.&P;  What we have in
the 80486 is a 386DX with a math coprocessor and a little bit of cache.&P;  Yes,
it's a marvel of integration.&P;  Yes, it's faster.&P;  Yes, the demand is an
insignificant fraction of the 386 market.&M;

What's the problem?&P;  Intel erred in naming it a 486 because it calls undue
attention to the CPU chip in the approval process.&P;  Coupled with the fact
that the 25-MHz 486 only offers a 12 to 15 percent boost over a 33-MHz 386,
it's tough to justify.&M;

Better for Intel to have named it the 386MX.&P;  The M would signify that
there's a math coprocessor on-board, and we'll all get a cheap thrill out of
saying "386MX" for the first week.&P;  Intel would have been able to position
the chip as a cost-effective, highly integrated choice in an already approved
product family.&M;

Instead, we got a raft of pointless machines like IBM's Model 70 with the
Power Platform, and others that were not significantly faster than their 386
forebears.&P;  The on-board cache is woefully inadequate for serious
applications, so the only time the 486 saves you money is when you absolutely
need the math coprocessor.&P;  Have you checked the list prices for 80387s
lately?&P;  If you can believe it, Intel asks a mere $994 for the 33-MHz
version.&M;

Speed will be the final factor to differentiate the 386 and the 486.&P;  The
chip architecture and Intel's marketing will limit the 386 to its current
33-MHz plateau, while the 486 will go on to 40 and 50 MHz.&P;  But that's poor
excuse for the chaos caused by the introduction of the 486.&M;

MULTIMEDIA&M;

In time, we may able to do something about this one.&P;  Multimedia hardware and
software are definitely on the way, but the term itself is a complete
misnomer.&P;  We're really taking about extended video and audio performance
here, and the inclusion of a CD-ROM player.&P;  So, yes, there are multiple
storage media, but that's not the important part.&P;  A traditional multimedia
system with videodisks, slide projection, stereo playback equipment, and
expensive synchronization hardware was necessary to match the capabilities of
the new Level One specification PCs.&M;

According to the Level One specification, which grew out of the annual CD-ROM
conerences, these machines will show photorealistic 256-color VGA images,
sport stereo digital-to-analog converters, and have an on-board digital
signal processor for sound synthesis.&P;  So it really represents the end of
crummy sound and barely adequate video, not a whole new set of presentation
media.&P;  PCs have always made sound and put images on the screen.&P;  Why should
we start calling them multimedia machines just because they're finally doing
it passably well?&M;

I propose that the industry come up with a stylized logo, a tripe S, or S
cubed, that stands for Sight, Sound, and Storage.&P;  It would be affixed to the
front panel of Level One machines, and come in the form of a sticker included
with the upgrade boards tht will take 286 and 386 machines in the installed
base to the Level One specification.&M;

We in the press are chiefly responsible for disseminating these coinages and
perversions of meaning, but it's everyone's responsibility to polide the
language and keep our communications as meaningful and free of unnecessary
jargon as possible.&P;  Our everyday shorthand, such as MIPs, megs, and LANs,
streamline communication; bad coinages impede it.&O;

<TITLE>The seven deadly sins of computing. (Humor) (column)

<TEXT>

The Seven Deadly Sins of Computing Mankind has been plagued by sin.&P;  Ask any
preacher.&P;  Ask any sinning preacher.&P;  While the Ten Commandments offered a
grand set of rules to decide your eventual fate after death, the classic
Seven Deadly Sins decided your fate while you were alive.&P;  These terrible
everyday sins have not gone away, and curse us to this day.&P;  In fact the
modern computer users, unaware of their influence, may not know that most
aspects of computing are dominated by these sins and their effect on the
hapless (and naive) computer user.&M;

Let's look at how this works.&M;

Sin Number One: Sloth&M;

Few computer users can avoid this most terrible and debilitating of sins.&O;
When was the last time you brought yourself to read the documentation
provided with software?&P;  Too lazy?&P;  Didn't think it was important?&P;  How about
cleaning that grimedup CRT screen?&P;  When was the last time you talked
yourself into doing that tiresome chore?&P;  Some users haven't been able to
spend the 15 minutes it takes to upgrade to the latest version of DOS as they
run DOS 2.0.&P;  "Oh, why bother, I'll wait until DOS 5.&M;

Sin Number Two: Avarice, Greed&M;

Ever go to a friend's house and demand bootleg copies of software that you
know you'll never use?&P;  You want copies only because you "must have a copy!"&O;
Some gree-ridden lost souls spend all their time downloading free programs
from GEnie even though they'll never look at them.&P;  "More, more, more!" More
money spent for on-line services is the real result of greed.&M;

Sin Number Three: Jealousy, Envy&M;

You get upset with the friend who has the newest 486 machine.&P;  You too must
have one, whether you need it or not.&P;  You lose sleep and money.&M;

Sin Number Four: Gluttony&M;

You have a 200-megabyte hard disk, and you've managed to feed it until 198
megabytes are filled--mostly with crap-ola.&P;  Unknown files, weird utilities,
null value programs.&P;  But can you bring yourself to erase these things?&O;
"They might be important someday."&P;  So you buy another 200 megabytes of
storage instead.&M;

Sin Number Five: Rage&M;

This comes from the time-wasting aspect of computing.&P;  You spend all
afternoon reprinting one document "trying to get it just right."&P;  Or you
spend all day mesmerized by Tetris and can't break loose.&P;  When you get home
you kick the dog.&M;

Sin Number Six: Lust&M;

You spend time poring over computer magazines looking at all the latest new
products.&P;  You dream of them.&P;  You try to talk your spouse into letting you
buy them.&P;  You actually drool over ads in PC Mag.&P;  (Well, maybe this isn't
such a bad sin.&P;  It pays my bills!)&M;

Sin Number Seven: Pride&M;

You gloat over your equipment.&P;  You brag to your friends.&P;  You tell them how
really, really fast your machine is compared with theirs.&P;  You show them a
wall of DOS performance books and crow about how you know every tip and
trick.&P;  You're the big shot in the office.&P;  When someone needs to know
something, you'll tell them what you think about it, whether you know
anything or not.&P;  You've become a blowhard.&M;

Now few computer sinners suffer from all of these sins.&P;  It's almost
impossible.&P;  But most of us are afflicted by at least one.&P;  Everyone, that
is, except me.&P;  Why would I care?&P;  I get free review copies of software and
hardware to examine.&P;  Send it all!!&P;  This way I can put it on the shelves and
show it off for everyone to see as they cower before my might 486 and giganto
color monitor.&P;  Pride?&P;  Gluttony?&P;  Avarice?&M;

Moi?&O;

Inside Tract Is there an attempt to suppress the facts about the performance
potential of the Intel i860 RISC chip?&P;  That seems to be a theme I keep
hearing.&P;  It's easy to see why when you put a MicroWay i860 card into a 386
machine and discover that you're running at over 40 mips!!&M;

Dubbed the Number Smasher 860 Coprocessor card, the board comes with 8
megabytes of RAM and is available at 33 or 40 MHz.&P;  While not cheap at $6,995
for the 33-MHz model, and $9,200 for the 40-MHz model, you do get one of the
MicroWay NDP compilers for free.&P;  MicroWay offers Fortran, PASCAL, and a new
C++ compiler tailored for the 860 card.&P;  The 860 becomes the primary
processor, and its number-crunchiung capabilities are incredible.&P;  The 386
controls the hard disk and acts as an ancillary processor in this scheme.&O;
This reverses the priorities encouraged by Intel.&P;  One company insider told
me that Intel wasn't too pleased with the MicroWay card because it
de-emphasized the cash cow 386 and drew attention to the high-performance
RISC chip.&M;

This reminds me of the time chip designer Roger Ross--the designer of the
Motorola 88000 RISC chip--told me that no finer CISC chip was ever developed
than the 486 and no worse RISC chip was ever designed than the i860.&P;  "But
the i860 will still outperform the 486!" he said.&M;

For those who are still suffering from the 286-AT blues, MicroWay has one of
the niftiest add-in 386SX cards available, the FastCache-SX, and it sells for
$595.&P;  Call the company for more information and a list of all its products.&O;
The company is in Kingston, Mass., (508) 746-7341, fax (508) 746-4678.&M;

Meanwhile, on the Other Side of the Chip Dept.: If you need a new hi-tech
buzzterm, try hyperstone.&P;  It refers to a new microprocessor design recently
licensed by Zilog (remember them?) from Hyperstone Electronics in West
Germany.&P;  The hyperstone design supposedly has the most performance per
transistor and uses a combination of RISC and CISC design parameters.&P;  The
hyperstone designer calls this EFISC (another new buzzterm) for enhanced fast
instruction set computer.&P;  Throw that around at the next cocktail party.&M;

Never Say Never Dept.: I've been telling vendors that I'm not interested in
laptops that weight over 4.5 pounds.&P;  Meanwhile, there is a wave of
inexpensive, yet powerful, 6.5 pounders hitting the streets all at once.&P;  In
this category, I'm most impressed with the Zeos Notebook 286.&P;  With its 20MB
hard disk, built-in floppy and VGA screen all for $1,995, it has to be the
number one contender.&P;  As well-engineered and nifty as this machine is, I'm
most impressed with the latest "Zeos touches."&P;  St. Paul-based Zeos
International (612-633-4591, fax 612-633-1325) may be the most tasteful and
genteel of all the high-profile cloners.&P;  Designed in-house, the little
notebook is very artsy in its look and feel.&P;  But I was most impressed with
the shipping box in which it came, no kidding.&P;  You should order one just to
check out the packaging.&P;  There is a box inside a box with "Thank you"
emblazoned on the inner box.&P;  The case for the laptop has custom pockets and
inside the disk pockets are blank disks!&P;  Highly recommended company in
general.&M;

The End Is Near Dept.: At least it is for photography as we know it.&P;  Kodak
is trying to promote a new concept where it will put your photos onto a
CD-ROM at beyond HDTV resolution.&P;  A CD-ROm will hold 100 pictures.&P;  The
initial advantage is convenience, but eventually we'll all be manipulating
images and the day of the snapshot will be over as the family squeezes and
twists the photo of little Becky until she looks like an alien.&P;  Family fun
in the 21st century.&M;

More CD-ROM Nonsense Dept.: Author David Rothman showed me a press release he
received from the CIA advocating a new CD-ROM standard to be used by the
intelligence community.&P;  The release said, "The U.S.&P;  Intelligence Community
has proposed a standard for CD-ROM read-only data exchange that is designed
to facilitate the interoperability of CD-ROM data bases among all operating
systems, CD-ROM drives, access/retrieval programs, and user interfaces.&P;  The
Information Handling Committee (IHC) of the Intelligence Community is
responsible for developing the proposed standard."&P;  It goes on and on mostly
in government bureaucratese to wit: "...&P;  to facilitate the efficient sharing
of data bases across organizational boundaries and between headquarters and
field components."&P;  This standard is called the CD-RDx standard.&M;

Rothman fears the worst with this crowd: Just imagine some trench coats
herding the top CD-ROM developers into a basement room with naked bulbs and
keeping them locked up until they agree on standards.&P;  Obviously this would
be more effective than your garden-variety symposium.&M;

To get a copy of the proposed CD-RDx standard write: IHC, Intelligence
Community Staff, P.O. Box 90828, Washington, D.C.&P;  20090.&P;  When asked if
there was a fax or phone number that could be called to expedite this
process, they told me "no"!&P;  I'm sure the standard will be as modern as their
exclusive use of the U.S.&P;  Mail for information exchange.&P;  Either that or you
just mention to your spouse that you want a copy of the CD-RDx standard, and
one appears the next day.&O;

</AUTHOR>
<SUMMARY>Video display terminals will adapt to what Windows 3.0 and its
users need, affecting the market's display standards and price
points.&P;  The more prevalent Windows 3.0 becomes, the more users
will understand the utility of having several files and programs
open on-screen at once.&P;  Users need to have fairly large windows
so their contents will be readable, thus a large-screen display is
necessary.&P;  The monitors must also have color capability to help
users differentiate between each window.&P;  High resolution is also
important, and VGA will be replaced by a new standard that offers
a bigger picture with more information.&P;  Video-display cards will
need to include speed-up circuitry for graphics acceleration.&O;
Integrated monitor-plus video card packages may emerge.&P;  Although
the next generation of display systems will be expensive, vendors
can feasibly offer a highly functional display for about $1,500.&M;

The New Generation Of Windows Displays I think the success of Windows 3.0 is
going to change how we think about PC monitors.&P;  And in the process, it's
going to turn that market, its display standars, and its price points upside
down.&M;

I reach that conclusion through an eight-step analysis of what Windows and
Windows users really need.&P;  Walk through this with me:&M;

(1) The wide use of Windows is going to help people understand the usefulness
of having several files, and often several programs, open on-screen at once.&M;

(2) It doesn't do much good to have several windows open at once unless you
can actually see what's going on in each one.&P;  The windows have to be fairly
large.&M;

(3) Accommodating several sizable windows means you need a large-screen
display.&P;  Thus the success of Windows is going to drive what will be a
white-hot market for larger monitors.&M;

(4) The use of color in a Windows 3.0 display is critical in helping users
differentiate between the windows, and the processes running within them.&O;
Monochrome monitors, regardless of size and resolution, are lousy with
Windows.&P;  The monochrome market is not long for this world.&M;

(5) When you have several windows open at once, each of fairly large size, on
that large display, you discover size and color aren't enough: You also need
lots of resolution.&P;  Blowing up VGA (640 by 480 pixels), or even Super VGA
(800 by 600), to, say, the size of a 19-inch screen isn't enough.&O;
Microscopists and astronomers call that "empty magnification": a bigger
picture that carries no more information.&P;  So VGA, while certainly not dead
(especially with help from Edsun, the anti-aliasing VGA-display wizards), is
not going to be the standard much longer.&P;  We're going back to a multiple
display-standards world once again.&M;

(6) When you've got to push that many pixels around, several bits deep per
pixel (for a large color palette), screen redraws slow to a crawl.&P;  That
makes some kind of graphics acceleration a must: People aren't going to put
up with sluggish displays just to get big screens and high resolution.&O;
Whether the future lies with Texas Instruments' flavor of graphics
acceleration, or Hitachi's, or other vendors', I think speed-up circuitry
will be a standard part of the next generation of high-res Windows-oriented
video-display cards.&M;

(7) The complications of matching video cards to video displays, once you get
beyond VGA-level resolution, are getting out of hand.&P;  Every time you see a
PC Magazine review of monitors or video cards with better-than-VGA
resolution, you also see a companion sidebar on how to run the maze of
choosing the right card or monitor to use with the products reviewed in that
story.&P;  Given the complications of effectively integrating all these
performance-related demands, and then actually selling that performance
package to end users, we're going to see a lot more integrated
monitor-plus-video card (plus Windows 3.0 drivers) packages appearing.&M;

(8) Those demands for screen size, color, high resolution, and fast
performance are going to heighten our sensitivity to related display issues,
such as antiglare features, much flatter to truly flat screens, and display
cabinets which waste as little desktop real estate as possible.&M;

All that says to me is the day of the 12-to 14-inch VGA monitor as the
business standard is drawing to a close.&P;  But what's going to replace all
those medium-sized VGAs?&M;

My guess is that the business PC-display market will split between
1,280-1,2024 noninterlaced displays for high-end uses, and 1,024-by-768
(851a-level) noninterlaced displays as the more commonplace standard.&M;

BIGGER IS BETTER&M;

Screen size?&P;  Sit down at a PC equipped with a 19-inch high-resolution
display running Windows 3.0 and you'll see in a few seconds why Windows makes
sense--even if you're a confirmed Windows-hater.&P;  Don't let anyone tell you
big displays are only for CAD or desktop publishing work: They're a joy for
anything you do at the PC.&P;  But as nice as 19-inch displays are, they're big,
heavy, and expensive.&P;  So I look for the emergence of a "semi-big" screen
size--probably a 16- or 17-inch diagonal screen--as the companion monitor for
those 1,024-by-768 video cards.&M;

It's easy to look at each step in that theory and see dollar signs.&P;  In fact,
every one of those heightened expectations is potentially costly.&P;  Add' em
all up and you wind up with $5,000 display systems.&M;

Which is about what the display I'm using right now costs.&P;  It's a superb new
19-inch 1,280-by-1,024 noninterlaced system from Moniterm.&P;  A Hitachi
graphics chip speeds up redraws; a flat tube gives an incredibly good
picture; and smart firmware on the Moniterm-designed card allows me to move
instantly around a four-screens-size "virtual desktop."&M;

And when I'm not running Windows, it provides an enlarged VGA display that
fills the screen, thanks to the close fit between 1,280 by 1,024 and 640 by
480.&M;

It is by a large margin the best display system I've ever seen on a PC.&P;  And
it's available today, not someday.&P;  I think this Moniterm package points the
way toward that next generation of display systems in almost every area.&O;
Except, of course, price.&M;

Businesses aren't about to spring for displays that cost $5,000 a pop for
everyone's PC.&P;  But there's magic in the $1,500 street-price range, and
that's where I'm convinced the fat part of this coming "Windows display
systems" market is headed.&M;

Vendors: Put those features I listed above on a card with 1,024-by-768 res,
package it with a sharp, bright 15-inch monitor, and price it in the
neighborhood of $1,500.&M;

Then stand back, lest you get trampled by the crowds.&O;

<SUMMARY>A review of 13 predictions for the computer industry during 1990
reveals that it was a key transitional year for the industry.&P;  As
predicted, the use of personal computers as building blocks for
larger systems is overshadowing the former emphasis on individual
productivity applications.&P;  Micro-based alternatives to costly
mainframe and minicomputer systems have gained prevalence during
1990.&P;  Predictions that 386-based systems, memory, PostScript
printers and other products would decrease dramatically in price
have also come true.&P;  In addition, predictions that EISA would
become the 32-bit bus standard for vendors instead of IBM's MCA
bus, that IBM's OS/2 Extended Edition would not be a major success
and that IBM, NeXT and Apple would face financial struggles in
1990 have all come to pass.&M;

Looking Back: 1990 Retrospective Nearly a year ago I made 13 predictions for
1990 (PC Magazine, January 16,1990).&P;  They were deliberately structured to
provide a commentary on what I expected to be key issues this year and their
likely outcomes.&P;  What better way to end the year than to review those
predictions?&M;

First, the shift I predicted from an emphasis primarily on individual
productivity applications to using personal computers (and micro technology
generallt) as building blocks for larger systems is clearly underway.&M;

Replacing costly mainframe and minicomputer systems with micro-based
alternatives, "downsizing," has become an important theme over the past 12
months.&P;  The word I first used back in 1985 has become a common one in the
industry's vocabulary.&M;

The significantly lower prices I predicted for 386-based systems, memory
PostScript printers, and other products have also come about as predicted.&O;
By early this fall, prices had fallen dramatically, making what only a year
ago were expensive high-end systems affordable today for the majority of
buyers.&M;

My predictions about a takeoff for OS/2 and closinf windows of opportunity
for Microsoft Windows, however, did not fare very well in 1990.&P;  OS/2 use did
not accelerate as I had thought it would, and the smashing success of Windows
3.0 rolled mercilessly over my prediction.&M;

Unrepentant sinner that I am, I still think the move onward to OS/2 will
come.&P;  I think I was just a bit ahead of my time.&P;  The renewed cooperation
between IBM and Microsoft announced in September should help pave the way for
OS/2.&P;  Still, I rate zeros on both these predictions for 1990.&M;

My prediction that Unix would continue to go nowhere on the desktop, however,
made it through the year with flying colors.&P;  For all the talk about Unix,
and all the semi-fanatical enthusiasm on the part of its more zealous
partisan, Unix market share on office PCs isn't much different from what it
was a year ago.&M;

That EISA would emerge as the dominant 32-bit bus standard for vendors other
than IBM, and the MCA clones would go nowhere, also provided to be a correct
prediction.&P;  MCA clones are all but a dead issue at this point, and EISA
systems are now available from the majority of vendors other than IBM.&M;

Another prediction that fared well this year was that at least some of the
traditional PC software vendors would be in for a rough time.&P;  Ashton-Tate's
difficulties were obvious to everyone, and once-mighty Lotus no longer leads
the best-seller charts.&P;  The overall financial results for the established
market leaders were generally disappointing.&M;

I also said that IBM,'s OS/2 Exrended Edition and OfficeVision would "tread
water, at best."&P;  Score another hit there.&P;  EE has had only minor impact so
far, and OfficeVision is reported to be in serious difficulty at this point.&M;

My ninth prediction about 1990 being a "banner year for lawyers" was, of
course, undeniably correct.&P;  There hasn't been a more litigious year in the
industry in recent memory.&P;  Assertion of intellectual property rights seems
to have become nearly as important as building and selling good products for
a depressingly large number of vendors.&M;

The tenth prediction of big gains for network servers is arguably right or
wrong depending on what aspects of the matter are emphasized.&P;  While sales of
conspicuous products like Compag's Systempro did not meet many people's
expectations in 1990, a stunning array of vendors reading like a Who's Who in
the industry introduced server produdcts at a ferocious pace throughout 1990.&M;

Ialso predicted a hard year for Apple.&P;  That has been borne out by two
things.&P;  First is Apple's declining financial fortunes in the calendar year
1990.&P;  Also the denunciations of Apple's market strategy given at MacWorld
Expo last August by the likes of Bill Campbell, then head of Apple's Claris
subsidiary, have demonstrated Apple's serious marketing difficulties.&M;

This fall's new product introductions by Apple are aimed at turning things
around, but it remains to be seen how successful the company will be in doing
so.&P;  Nevertheless, 1990 is not a year Apple would want to repeat.&M;

While some diehards might want to argue the point, my prediction that "NeXT
Isn't" also looks good.&P;  NeXT sales were poor through the first part of the
year.&P;  The much-vaunted deal with Businessland did nothing for NeXT and
nothing for Businessland.&M;

NeXT respondended to its dismal showing in the market with an improved
product line, including color systems, this fall.&P;  So far, however, there is
little convincing evidence that this latest (and probably last) effort is
paying off, either.&M;

Finally, I said that IBM's epeatedly anticipated turnaround won't come in
1990, either.&P;  We won't know for sure how that one turns out until IBM
announces its fourth-quarter financial results in mid-January.&P;  Based on what
we've seen thus far, however, it looks like my prediction will prove correct.&M;

The bottom line, therefore, looks to me like eight correct, two wrong, at
least for 1990 (OS/2 and Windows), two probables (NeXT and IBM), and one in
between (network servers).&P;  That adds up to a win/lose/tie record of 8-2-3
which will go up to 10-2-1 if NeXT doesn't turn out to be the favorite
stocking stuffer this holiday season and IBM's financial results in the
current quarter are as dismal as I expect them to be.&M;

CHANGING WAYS OF BUSINESS&M;

Two events I didn't predict this year but wish I had may be even more
interesting than the ones I did.&P;  The first is the spectacular growth of
system vendors that sell direct.&P;  Vendors like Austin, CompuAdd, Dell,
Gateway 2000, Northgate, Swan, TriStar, and Zeos have radically and probably
permanently changed the distribution structure of the industry.&M;

The second is the general decline of traditional computer storefront dealers.&O;
Unable to meet their promise of service and support to justify higher prices,
they have seen their role reduced over the past year.&P;  Only those who truly
add value through expertise--MicroAge is a good example--continue to do well.&M;

In retrospect, 1990 is likely to prove to have been a key transitional year
for the industry.&P;  A number of important issues that were unsettled and
unsettling in 1990 appear on their way to resulution as 1991 approaches.&O;
Prospects are good for a solid resumption of growth in 1991, despite what may
be unfavorable conditions in the economy generally.&P;  That, however, is a
topic for my upcoming predictions for 1991.&O;

<SUMMARY>Microcomputers based on 33-MHz Intel 80386 microprocessors are the
best choice for mainstream power users.&P;  Selecting a computer can
be difficult because so many 33-MHz 386 machines are available.&O;
The difference in performance between most of the systems is less
than 10 percent on the 80386 Instruction Mix benchmark, so
peripheral performance is more an issue than processor
performance.&P;  All the systems use SRAM memory caching to improve
performance.&P;  Users should decide how the systems will be used and
choose a vendor that offers the suitable configuration at an
acceptable price.&P;  Many users consider documentation quality and
support services when choosing a system.&P;  Most vendors bundle
Microsoft Windows 3.0, DOS and a mouse, and some will configure
the system before delivery.&M;

Mainstream Muscle As 1990 winds down, we can look back on a big year in the
PC marketplace.&P;  Memory prices went down, 80486 systems began to appear in
quantity, hard disks got bigger, faster, and cheaper, and Microsoft Windows
3.0 gave us all a reason to want more in--and from--our PCs.&P;  No wonder,
then, that this was the year that saw the 33-MHz 386 taking over as the
mainstream power machine, leaving 486 systems to make their mark as very
high-end engineering, scientific, and graphics-intensive workstations.&M;

The demand for 33-MHz 386 PCs seems confirmed by the sheer number of vendors
selling these systems.&P;  It seems that there are more machines at this level
than at any other in the PC hierarchy.&P;  In this issue, we take a look at 45
computers with 33-MHz 386 brains.&P;  If you think that's an impressive figure,
you'll really be astonished to find that it doesn't begin to include all the
33-MHz 386 systems in existence.&P;  In the October 31, 1989 issue, we covered
22 computers in this class, and in the February 13, 1990 issue, we reviewed
another batch of 22.&P;  None of the machines represented in those tworeviews
are included in this roundup--that means you can ponder yet another 45
machines before you buy.&P;  (Watch for a near-future issue examining the 33-MHz
386s that have been significantly updated by their manufacturers since the
October and February reviews.)&M;

REVIEW CRITERIA&M;

Add to the above list two machines from well-known manufacturers that were
not included n this round-up.&P;  Tandy failed to get an evaluation unit to us
before our deadline, and Arche sent a machine that was too different from the
test specification--a 150MB hard disk, 4MB of RAM, a 64K RAM cache, one
floppy drive, and DOS 3.3 or 4.0--to be included.&P;  We made allowances only
for minor variations from the requested specification--for instance, machines
that came in with hard disks ranging from 120MB to 200MB, or those that came
with smaller RAM caches were fit for inclusion.&M;

The final list included systems from ACMA, AGI, ARC, Argo, ACT, Bitwise
Designs, Blue Star, Brain, BSI, CAF, Clone, CompuAdd, Computer Marketplace,
Core, CSR, DEC, Dynamic Decisions, EPS, Everest, Fortron, GRid, Hertz,
Hyundai, Insight, Master Computer, Matrix, Memorex, Micro Telesis, Mitsuba,
MultiMicro, Novacor, Peregrine, Premier, PSG, Quill, SAI, Swan, Tandon,
Tatung, Televideo, Tenex, Texas Micro Systems, Transource, Unisys, and Wang.&M;

BUYING DECISIONS&M;

In the crownded PC field, the 16- and 20MHZ SX models own the entry-level
layers, and the 486 systems get bragging rights for having the msot
technically advanced processor.&P;  But unless you rely on applications that can
make use of the 486 chip's built-in math coprocessor capabilities, such as
the ones mentioned earlier, or unless you must have the latest and greatest
design around, you'll find that the 33-MHz 386 gives you the most bang for
your buck.&P;  (See the sidebar "The 386-33: Today's Best Buy.")&M;

The wide range of 386/33 machines available leads to a buyer's dilemma: what
criteria do you use for selecting one system out of almost 100?&P;  It would be
a mistake to use the systems' results on our benchmark tests as your only
guide--we found that one 33-MHz 386 machine performs pretty much the same as
the other 33-MHz 386 machines.&P;  Aside from a few stragglers at the bottom of
the pack, there was less than a 10 percent difference on the 80386
Instruction Mix test results between the slower machines reviewed here and
their faster counterparts.&P;  Interestingly, these fast systems, which we
tested with BIOS shadowing turned on, didn't do drastically better on this
test than the 386/33s reviewed without BIOS shadowing enabled in our pervious
two roundups.&P;  The best score here was 1.59; compare that to the 1.63 and
1.61 Instruction Mix times racked up by machines in the October and February
reviews, respectively.&M;

Among the systems reviewed here, there were more significant differences in
the hard disk and video times, but since those results are at least as
dependent on the components used as they are on the motherboard design, you
can generally increase performance by opting for better parts.&P;  A traditional
ST-506 MFM drive was sufficient for older 8088 and 80286 systems, but a
386/33 can support faster components.&P;  ESDI, SCSI, and IDE interfaces are in
use among these machines, with ESDI being the most popular.&P;  Additionally,
part of the CompuAdd machine's integral design is its disk controller with
cache memory--a factor that no doubt played a large part in the system's
excellent performance on our PC Labs' Disk Benchmark test.&M;

All the 33-MHz 386s reviewed in this issue, and in the two previous, boasted
a processor RAM cache, usually 32K or 64K.&P;  The system cache speeds
performance by storing information in fast static RAM, so the CPU rarely has
to wait for a refresh cycle before fetching information from memory.&P;  This
design is typically behind a vendor's claim of "zero wait state" operation.&O;
Perhaps not surprisingly, the three top performers reviewed here boated 64K
caches; the three slowest, only 32K--again, though, the spread is so slight
that you shouldn't make your purchase based solely on these numbers.&M;

The PC marketplace, and the 33-MHz 386 arena in particular, has become so
crowded that a competitive price is almost assumed as a given requirement by
the buyers--of course, the definition of a competitive price varies depending
on whether you're speaking about a brand name product versus a clone, or a
retail product versus a direct-marketed machine.&P;  Your decisions will most
likely be based on factors such as what you plan to do with the system, the
vendor's warranty and support, and the extras included.&M;

Determining the use to which the system will be put is the first step.&P;  The
33-MHz 386 that you want to use as a file server for your network certainly
has different memory and storage expansion requirements than does the machine
destined to run large spreadsheets, or the one to be used for stand-alone
database applications.&P;  Most mail-order vendors stand ready with an a la
carte approach, offering you a zillion possible combinations of different
cases, hard drives, displays, and memory configurations.&P;  Some other vendors
are more inflexible in their offerings, with only a few hard disk options
defining your choices.&P;  Your job is to make certain that you can get your
system outfitted with the mix of components that you need.&M;

Many vendors today seek to differentiate their products through service
features; this is as true of the 33-MHz 386 as it is of most products in a
company's line.&P;  Some offer free technical support as long as you own the
computer; others provide 24-hour-a-day phone support.&P;  May use either their
own dedicated electronic bulletin board system (BBS) or a national service
such as CompuServe to post technical information and answer common questions.&O;
Of course, there are still those who offer little or no technical support
services--in these cases you typically trade support for lower prices.&M;

Repair policies also vary widely.&P;  Some vendors still require that you ship
the machine back to them for repair, but many have discovered that buyers
want faster and more convenient service.&P;  As a result, you will find more
on-site service contracts bundled with systems, or provisions for shipping
you parts overnight without waiting for the broken component to be received.&M;

THE WINDOWS EDGE&M;

Many of these vendors seek an edge by bundling more goodies with their
systems than the competition.&P;  In the past, this has been limited to
utilities such as backup and video programs, and the odd piece of hardware
like a mouse that comes with the display adapter card.&P;  With last summer's
release of Windows 3.0, however, the field has changed.&P;  Microsoft has made
it nearly irresistible to 386/33 vendors to bundle Windows; but the carch is
that Microsoft makes it part of the deal that the program be bundled with all
the vendor's machines of that model.&M;

Some vendors have taken Microsoft's deal and made it even better for the
buyer.&P;  Since the Windows bundle includes DOS and a mouse as well, some
vendors opt to install DOS and Windows on the hard disk.&P;  With the system
configured for you, all you have to do is take the machine out of its
shipping cart and plug it in.&P;  You'll be up and running in record time.&P;  The
best part of the Windows deal is that some vendors offer it at prices
comparable to systems that don't include it.&M;

Finally, the documentation delivered with a PC can be an important element in
the decision-making process.&P;  The only ones who won't care so much about
well-written documentation are the experienced power users familiar with the
insides of PCs in general--people who have no qualms about identifying video
cards and hard disk cable attachments just by looking inside.&P;  However, there
are many users out there who, however experienced they may be with software,
get lost when it comes to troubleshooting poorly documented hardware.&P;  As the
386/33 moves forward into the mainstream market, it's going to be showing up
on the desks of a lot more of the less-savvy users--people who will benefit
from the extra effort made by vendors who don't just throw in a collection of
pamphlets provided by the manufacturers of components like the motherhood,
I/O card, video adapter, disk controller, and hard disk.&P;  If a stack of stray
papers filled with technobabble doesn't intimidate you or the users you buy
for, then you may get away with spending a lot less money.&P;  If it does, then
your real savings may come by investing in a well-documented machine in the
first place.&P;  As a general rule, the bigger the vendor, the better documented
the system.&M;

Whether you opt for an inexpensive machine that doesn't have a lot of service
options or come with complete documentation, or you prefer a system with the
works, rest assured that you will be picking a PC that makes sense as the
practical business system in today's market.&P;  In less than a year and a half,
386/33 systems have gone from being an expensive hotshot rarity to an
affordable and commonplace workhorse ready to churn out your tasks.&P;  No
longer an extravagance, this is the level of machine to pick if you need full
power in a business computer.&O;

AGI Computer Inc. AGI 3900B AGI is a wholly owned subsidiary of Everex
Computer Systems, but don't think its 3900B is another Everex Step
machine--the AGI systems are designed and manufactured separately from the
parent organization's other lines.&P;  Sold primarily through consultants and
VARs, the AGI 3900B is a beautifully made, large-tower-based system that even
includes an excellent manual.&M;

At $7,438 for the standard configuration, this computer certainly isn't
inexpensive, but discounts of 25 to 35 percent are probably available.&P;  The
standard configuration, which is identical to the one we tested, includes 4MB
RAM, 64K processor RAM cache, a 158MB 14-millisecond Maxtor ESDI hard drive
with an Everex ESDI controller, a TEAC 1.2MB floppy disk drive, and an Everex
Viewpoint 512K Super VGA display adapter with the Tseng ET4000 chip set.&P;  A
14-inch color multisynchronous Evervision Monitor 300, featuring a
0.28-millimeter dot mask and up to 1,024-by-768 interlaced performance,
completes the display system.&P;  Other components include a 101-key Key Tronic
keyboard with 12 function keys, two serial ports, one parallel port, and DOS
4.01.&M;

Designed by AGI's engineers, the motherboard incorporates discrete logic for
both the 386 instruction set and the write-back processor RAM cache.&P;  The RAM
cache comes in just one size, 64K, and makes use of 20-nanosecond SRAM DIP
chips.&M;

You can set the system to run at 8, 12, or 33 MHz if you wish, and you can
separately set the bus speed to 8.25 (the safest), 12.5, or 16.5 MHz.&P;  The
ROM BIOS on the AGI machine uses AMI chips and includes selectable system ROM
BIOS shadowing, but won't shadow video BIOS instructions (not a loss since
the video times are great).&P;  The motherboard can handle either an Intel 80387
33-MHz or Weitek 3167 math coprocessor chip, but not both.&M;

The motherboard holds up to 8MB of interleaved page-mode memory using 1MB
SIMM modules rated at just 100 ns., but that didn't seem to hamper the
machine's performance on our memory benchmark test.&P;  To expand your system
beyond 8MB, you need to invest in a $280 memory card and then buy standard
memory modules through your dealer or consultant.&M;

The AGI 3900B scored consistently well on the PC Labs benchmark tests, with
average to better than average scores on the processor and memory tests.&P;  The
DOS File Access (Small REcords) test was a bit below average, but the large
record test and BIOS Disk Seek test scores were in the middle of the pack.&O;
The video Direct to Screen test and Video BIOS Routine with Scrolling test
scores were among the very top, although the Video BIOS Without Scrolling
test score was only in the middle-range of machines tested in this review.&M;

The massive AGI tower-style case measures 26 by 7 by 18.5 inches.&P;  If you
extend the system support feet, the width increases to 12.5 inches, but only
at the very bottom.&P;  The keyboard lock, power switch, and reset buttom are
all on the front of the case.&P;  Inside the case the frame and drive chassis
are very solid.&P;  An added measure of the case's quality is its FCC Class B
rating.&M;

ROOM FOR EXPANSION&M;

The AGI 3900B has room for loads of storage devices.&P;  Four half-height
5.25-inch drives, each with the potential of handling removable media
devices, can be stacked in front.&P;  Two full-height (or, if you prefer, two
more half-height 5.25-inch) drives also can be installed internally, one
right behind the other in the midsection of the case.&M;

To power a fully loaded system, the AGI computer has a Skynet Electronics
250-watt power supply with dual voltage and a full complement of six device
power leads.&P;  A full case generates a good deal of heat in the course of a
day's work, so there's a bottom from intake fan to work with the exhaust fan
that's part of the top-back-mounted power supply.&M;

The AGI 3900B's set of expansion slots is the norm for this class, with one
8-bit slot and six 16-bit slots, as well as a 32-bit slot for the optional
proprietary memory card.&M;

While AGI Computer sells systems solely to distributors, who in turn sell
them to the VARs, VADs, and consultants, AGI machines--though not this
particular system--have been advertised in such places as a Crutchfield
Personal Office catalog.&P;  All computers made by AGI come with a standard
one-year parts and labor warranty with service provided through dealers.&P;  An
extended warranty and optional on-site service are available, but the way
they're generally sold dictates that the consultants and VARs are the ones
who will be primarily responsible for system support and service should you
have a problem.&M;

The size and drive room of the AGI 3900B suggest its use as a file server or
multiuser computer.&P;  The price is fairly hefty, but then you're almost sure
to get hefty discounts, probably without even asking.&P;  This well-made system
with good test scores is just begging to be loaded with huge disk drives.&O;

<SUMMARY>AGI Computer Inc's AGI 3900B microcomputer is a well-built system
that would perform well as a file server or individual
workstation.&P;  The system is offered only through value-added
resellers (VARs) and consultants, and the $7,438 list price is
relatively high, although 25 to 35 percent discounts are
available, and VARs will typically set up systems and networks.&O;
The 3900B uses an AGI motherboard with 4Mbytes RAM and a 64Kbyte

uses 100 nanosecond (ns) DRAM, although the system performance was
good.&P;  A 14-millisecond (ms), 158Mbyte ESDI hard disk and
controller and a 1.2 Mbyte floppy disk are also included.&P;  The
system uses a Super VGA adapter with 512Kbytes video RAM and a

ACMA Computers Inc. ACMA 386/33 Corporate Workstation If you're in the market
for a plain-vanilla single-user computer, the ACMA 386/33 Corporate
Workstation may be exactly what you want.&P;  Reasonably priced, the FCC Class A
full-size desktop machine offers the requisite number of expansion slots and
bays, and registers acceptable but not astounding bencmark test scores.&M;

The list price for the standard (and tested) configuration is $3,295, one of
the lower quotes for fully equipped machines in this issue.&P;  The system came
with 4mb of 70-nanosecond RAM, a 64K RAM cache, an NEC 157MB 18-millisecond
ESDI hard disk with the Ultrastor 32K buffer combination hard and floppy disk
drive controller, and both 1.2MB and 1.44MB TEAC floppy disk drives.&P;  The
video system consists of Helm Engineering's Impression 512K RAM 1,024-by-768
video adapter with a Western Digital/Paradise video chip set and a dual
voltage (110/220) Impression Super VGA interlaced 1,024-by-768 color monitor.&O;
Other standard configuration features include a 101-key MaxiSwitch keyboard,
two serial ports, one parallel port, and one game port, and DOS 4.01 (DOS 3.3
can be substituted, instead).&M;

The Corporate Workstation employs ACMA'S own motherboard with a wiredin
discrete logic 386 chip set and the AMI ROM BIOS.&P;  This motherboard does not
support video or ROM BIOS shadowing.&P;  The cache is also controlled by
discrete motherboard logic circuitry, and makes use of 25-ns.&P;  64-kilobit
SRAM memory chips.&P;  The cache size is not expandable, though this should not
be considered a limitation since anything greater than an 8K cache often
yields no significant performance increse with standard DOS applications.&O;
The ACMA motherboard has a single math coprocessor socket that can take
either an Intel 80387 33-MHz or Weitek 3167 33-MHz unit, but not both.&M;

The Corporate Workstation can take up to 8MB on the motherboard using 256Kb
or 1MB SIMM modules in an interleaved page-mode memory configuration.&P;  If you
want to expand to the system's maximum 16MB RAM, a $150 proprietary 32-bit
memory board can hold an additional 8MB of RAM, currently priced at $100 per
megabyte.&M;

CORPORATE BEIGE&M;

The Corporate Workstation's fairly standard AT-style desktop case measures
6.5 by 21 by 16.8 inches (HWD).&P;  The power switch is on the right side and
the reset button and combination case and keyboard lock are on the front.&O;
The drive chassis holds up to five hald-height 5.25-inch floppy disk drives
(with three able to use removable media storage devices).&P;  The 200-watt
Taiwan Litton Electronic power supply has power leads for only four drives.&M;

There are eight expansion slots in the ACMA machine, one 8-bit, six 16-bit,
and the last serving double duty either for the 32-bit memory expansion board
or a standard 16-bit interface board.&P;  The test machine used the 8-bit slot
for an I/O board and two 16-bit slots for the video and drive controller
boards, leaving five slots free.&M;

The ACMA machine is an average performer in an overall speedy group, with
processor scores landing on the low end of the mid-range, but the memory
score falling on the high side of average.&P;  Drive scores varied in a similar
manner, with the unit garnering average DOS file Access test scores on the
small-record test, and above average results on the large-record test.&P;  The
BIOS Disk Seek scores were just below average, but true to the ESDI hard
drive's 18-ms.&P;  rate.&P;  The Direct to Screen video score landed right at the
median point of the tested range; Video BIOS with and without scrolling marks
were slightly below average.&M;

ACMA sells computers via mail order and telephone order only.&P;  The company
provides a one-year warranty on parts and two years on labor for all systems.&O;
There is no standard on-site service contract, although an option to secure
Memorex/Telex as the service provider is available.&P;  If you buy a system and
have a problem, ACMA supplies unlimited toll-free technical support and will
ship replacement parts via air freight.&P;  If you and its technical staff can't
solve the problem via telephone, ACMA will pay return shipping costs by
whatever method you use to send the computer to its California location.&P;  To
top it all off, ACAM offers a better-than-average 45-day money-back
guarantee.&M;

It's not the fastest machine around, nor the most expandable, but ACMA's
386/33 Corporate Workstation performs up to expectations, and sells for a
decent price.&P;  Standard on-site service would make the 386/33 more
competitive with other machines from mail-order vendors, but otherwise this
machine gives you solid value for your dollar.&O;

American Research Corp. ARC 386/33 Skyscraper As its name implies, American
Research Corp.'s ARC 386/33 Skyscraper is a fullsize tower-style machine,
measuring 23.8 by 6.5 by 19 inches.&P;  However, it offers only average
expansion room for a desk-top and only average performance; it's the
competitive price and the company's standard on-site service that make it
worthy of attention.&M;

Our test system, configured to the PC Magazine standard for this class, costs
$3,575.&P;  Components include 4MB RAM, a 64K processor RAM cache, a 137MB
15-millisecond Seagate SCSI drive with a Future Domain SCSI drive controller,
and 1.2MB and 1.44MB TEAC floppy disk driveS.&P;  The video card is a 16-bit
Super VGA 1,024-by-768 interlaced capable unit with a WEstern
Digital/Paradise video chip set that is paired with a Samsung CM4551 0.31
-millimeter dot-mask, 14-inch, 800-by-600 color Super VGA monitor.&P;  The
system also includes ARC's own 101 -key keyboard with a 60-inch cable, a
60-inch extension cable, two serial ports, one parallel port, DOS 4.01,
Windows 3.0, and a Microsoft serial mouse.&M;

The Skyscraper, which can run at either 8 MHz or 33 MHz, was a below average
performer on the PC Labs benchmark tests.&P;  The processor times were above
average but the memory speed test score fell at the bottom of the group; it
took 0.36 seconds compared with the median 0.31 seconds in the Conventional
Memory test.&P;  Relative to the drives in the other units, the hard disk times
were all fairly slow.&P;  The video scores produced mixed, but overall slightly
below average, results.&M;

ARC uses its own motherboard, including discrete 386 instruction circuitry
and the company's own cache controller.&P;  The ROM BIOS is by AMI.&P;  Both video
and system ROM BIOS shadowing can be selected independently via the CMOS
setup utility.&P;  The system provides for both an 80387 33-MHz math coprocessor
and a Weitek 3167 unit.&M;

The processor RAM cache is equipped with 25-nanonsecond, 64K SRAM DIP chips,
and can be expanded to 128K if specified.&P;  The ARC can provide for a full
16MB of processor RAM on the motherboard using 80-ns.&P;  SIMM module chips for
the interleaved page-mode memory architecture.&M;

LESS THAN TOWERING DRIVE CAPACITY&M;

Power, turbo, and rest switches and buttons are all on the front of the case.&O;
To help cool the Skyscraper's interior, the case includes an intake fan
located at the bottom front to work in conjunction with the 200-watt top-rear
mounted power supply's exhaust fan.&M;

The drive expansion setup on the FCC Class A--rated Skyscraper is a bit
unusual, though acceptable for a single-user machine.&P;  For drives with
removable media there are two exposed front 3.5-inch and two 5.25-inch
half-height bays.&P;  There's also an interior bay that can hold one full-height
or two half-height drives.&P;  The machine's ability to accommodate six devices
is about two short of what you might expect from a tower-size system being
positioned as a file server.&P;  Additionally, the power supply comes with only
four device leads, which you'll have to agument with power splitters if
necessary.&P;  There are eight expansion slots, two 8-bit and six 16-bit; five
were free in the review machine.&M;

ARC sells computers through dealers, a direct sales force, and VARs, as well
as via mail order.&P;  Its systems come with a one-year parts-and-labor warranty
and standard on-site service via Video Aid Corp.&M;

The Skyscraper's on-site service and 16MB-capable motherboard are definite
pluses, but its lackluster performance and middling drive expansion space
keep the system from earning a recommendation as a file server.&P;  It may
function better as a singler user's machine, particularly if that user is
more interested in price than performance.&O;

the highest video benchmark scores despite average system
performance scores.&P;  The standard configuration includes 4Mbytes
of RAM, expandable to 8Mbytes on the motherboard plus 12Mbytes on
a proprietary expansion board.&P;  The machine uses a 32Kbyte SRAM
cache and has a 179Mbyte hard drive and a 1.2Mbyte floppy drive.&O;
The Argo Tower's tower case includes a 230-watt power supply with
only four device power leads.&P;  Orchid's warranty covers parts and

Argo Computers Inc. Argo Tower 386/33 The Argo Tower 386/33 is a full-size
tower case machien with loads of drive room and solid performance, making it
an appropriate choice for a drive-crazy single user or as a file server.&M;

Argo has relabeled the superb Orchid system, selling it for $3,534 in the
standard configuration, including 4MB RAM, a 32K processor RAM cache, a
Connor IDE hard disk formatted to 179MB (it can be formatted to 212MB
maximum), a 1.2MB TEAC floppy disk drive, and an Orchid 1,024-by-768 display
adapter using the powerful Tseng ET4000 chip set.&P;  A 14-inch Sony MultiScan
Super VGA color monitor, capable of 1,024-by-768 interlaced resolution, is
also part of the deal.&P;  It's all topped off with a Monterey 101-key keyboard,
one parallel and two serial ports, and DOS 4.01 or 3.3.&P;  Our test machine
also included a 1.4MB floppy disk drive and a Logitech serial mouse, raising
the final price to $3,652.&M;

The 386/33 houses an Orchid motherboard using a VLSI brand 386 chip set and
AMI ROM BIOS.&P;  The unit runs at either 11.2 MHz or 33.3 MHz, with the bus
speed fixed at 8 MHz.&P;  The system supports both video and system ROM BIOS
shadowing, either of which can be selected via the CMOS setup program.&P;  The
motherboard has a math coprocessor socket that can handle either an Intel
80387 33-MHz or Weitek 3167 number cruncher.&M;

The nonexpandable 32K processor RAM cache uses 20-nanosecond SRAM chips and
utilizes the Intel 82385 cache controller for a two-way associative caching
scheme.&P;  A maximum of 8MB of fast page interleaved system memory can be
installed on the motherboard using 80-ns.&P;  1MB SIMM memory modules; you can
also use 256K modules on the motherboard.&P;  A $199 proprietary memory
expansion board takes up to 12MB of RAM with 1MB SIMM modules, although the
system can address just up to 16MB of RAM.&P;  Argo Computers' price for memory
upgrades at the time of this review was $73 per megabyte, the lowest quoted
retail price we've seen to date.&M;

NO DEARTH OF DRIVES&M;

The Argo's case measures 25.5 by 8 by 18 inches.&P;  All buttons and switches
are on the front, including the power switch, turbo, and reset buttons, and a
combination keyboard and case lock.&P;  The drive chassis has a stack of eight
half-height 5.25-inch drive bays that can also be used for four full-height
drives, or combinations of the two types.&P;  The top four bays can use drives
with removable media.&M;

The 230-watt Procase power supply has only four device power leads, too few
for the system's potentially very full house of drives.&P;  Additionally,
there's only one fan in the system, so if you load this box with RAM and
drives, it will probably be a good idea to add an intake fan on the bottom
inside front to aid in cooling.&M;

The system has a standard complement of interface card expansion slots: two
8-bit, five 16-bit, and a 32-bit for the optional proprietary memory
expansion card.&P;  The 32-bit slot will also accept a standard 8-bit card.&M;

Argo's 386/33 is certainly no performance slouch.&P;  It scored right in the
middle of the tested group on the processor, memory, and small-record DOS
File Access tests.&P;  The large-record DOS File Access test result was a bit
below average, but on the BIOS Disk Seek test the Conner drive outperformed
its 16-millisecond rating by scoring 15 ms.&P;  The video benchmark test scores
were all in the top quarter of the tested group.&M;

Located in Reno, Nevada, Argo Computers currently sells through two of its
own retail stores and via mail order, with 90 percent of its sales
distributed through the latter channel.&P;  Orchid backs this system with a
warranty that includes parts and labor for four years on the video board, two
years on the motherboard, and one year on everything else.&P;  There is no
provision for on-site service, but Argo will ship replacement parts or pay
shipping both ways if a unit fails in the first 80 days after purchase.&P;  For
the balance of the warranty period, the vendor pays shipping one way only.&M;

The Argo 386/33 is a well-performing machine at a competitive price.&P;  It
offers ample drive space for use as a file server, though a larger power
supply with more device leads and a second fan are in order if you're going
to stuff one of these computers to maximum capacity.&O;

Automated Computer Technology Corp. ACT386-33FC Automated Computer
Technology's 33-MHz mini-tower machine is a class act all the way around.&O;
The ACT386-33FC standard configurtion's $4,450 price tag is slightly higher
than other 33-MHz machies sold via mail order, but you may well decide the
extra money is worth it for the overall quality.&M;

The standard configuration comes with 4MB RAM, a 64K processor RAM cache, a
167MB Seagate/CDC/Imprimis 15-millisecond IDE hard disk, and a Chinon 1.2MB
floppy disk drive.&P;  The video system includes a PowerGraph 1,024-by-768
interlaced Super VGA display adapter with the impressive Tseng ET4000 video
chip set, and a CTX CSV-3450 Super VGA color monitor.&P;  Other standard
configuration features include a 102-key BTC keyboard, two serial ports, one
parallel port, DOS 4.01 Windows 3.0, and a Microsoft serial mouse.&M;

Our tet machine arrived equipped with 8MB RAM, an 80387 33-MHz coprocessor,
and both 1.2MB and 1.44MB Chinon floppy disk drives, at a list price of
$5,484.&P;  However, the ACT386-33fc achieved its noteworthy benchmark test
scores with only 4MB RAM installed (a math coprocessor chip will not affect
benchmark test results).&P;  The benchmark test scores generally testify to the
ACT386-33FC's intelligent design and combination of components.&P;  The
processor scores were way above average, the memory time was right in the
middle of the pack, and the small-record DOS File Access time ranked in the
top quarter.&P;  However, that was balanced by the large-record DOS File Access
time, which fell among the bottom quarter of units tested.&P;  While the Video
BIOS Routine test scores hovered in the low average range, the video Direct
to Screen test score was one of the fastest.&M;

The motherboard is ACT's own, using discrete circuitry instead of a separate
386 chip set, the Intel 82385 RAM processor RAM cache controller, and the AMI
ROM BIOS.&P;  The processor RAM cache uses 20-nanosecond SRAM chips, and can be
expanded to 256K.&P;  If you wish to install a Weitek math coprocessor you can,
but not simultaneously with an 80387 chip.&P;  The system allows optional
selection of both video and ROM BIOS shadowing.&M;

The ACT386-33FC accommodates either 256K or 1MB 80-ns.&P;  SIMM memory modules
in an interleaved page-mode memory scheme.&P;  With 1MB modules you can have a
maximum of 8MB on the motherboard; expanding to the system's 16MB maximum
requires a proprietary memory expansion card.&M;

The ACT's case, measuring 15.8 by 6.8 by 19.5 inches, is impressive.&P;  The
idea of a mini-tower design is to have a case that sits on a desktop without
taking up too much space, and that lets you easily insert and remove floppy
disks, tapes, CDs, or other removable media.&P;  A full-height door covers the
fronts of all the ACT's drive bays and the reset and turbo buttons and
keyboard lock; a window lets you see the two-digit LED processor speed
display.&P;  With the door closed, the only accessible control is the front,
top-mounted, red power switch.&M;

CONCERN FOR QUALITY&M;

Inside, the FCC Class A case's construction shines--as does the quality drive
chassis and other support bracing.&P;  All of the internal support structures
are shiny and well-finished, a touch that doesn't directly matter to
performance but does indicate a concern for quality.&M;

There is room in the ACT386-33FC for five half-height 5.25-inch drives,
stacked one on top of another in the front of the machine.&P;  All five can use
removable media, an unlikely necessity but an arrangement that allows
flexibility in where you place which drives.&P;  A 200-watt Enhance power supply
has five device connectors, so if you decide to load the case with drives you
needn't search for a power splitter.&M;

The ACT offers the usual complement of expansion card slots with one 8-bit
slot and six 16-bit slots; an eighth slot can be used either for the 32-bit
proprietary memory ccard or as a second 8-bit slot.&M;

Automated Computer Technology sells computers via mail order and through a
direct sales force.&P;  The company's background is in mainframe software
development and many of those customers make up its computer business.&P;  ACT
computers come with a standard one-year parts-and-labor warranty and an
on-site service contract with TRW.&P;  The service contract targets a 24- to
48-hour response time, if the problem cannot be determined and fixed over the
telephone.&M;

The ACT386-33FC is a well-made machine with easy drive access, good
performance, and impressive attention to construcction detail.&P;  This computer
is easy to recommend.&O;

Bitwise Designs Incc.&P;  Bitwise 333C Just under 19 inches tall, the Bitwise
333C, from Bitwise Designs Inc., qualifies as a large mini-tower, though
Bitwise prefers to call it midsize.&P;  By either designation, it offers plenty
of room for expansion and an innovative drive bay arrangement for maximum
flexibility.&P;  To cap it off, it's a better than average performer at a
midrange price.&M;

The 333C's PC Magazine standard configuration lists for $4,275 and comes with
4MB RAM, a 64K RAM cache, a TEAC 1.2MB floppy disk drive, an 18-millisecond
153MB hard disk, a CTX VGA monitor with 720-by-480 maximum resoluution, a
101-key Key Tronic keyboard, one parallel, one game, and two serial ports,
and DOS 4.01.&P;  However, our review unit arrived with a Conner 100MB 3.5-inch
hard disk and cost $3,975.&P;  For $2,700 Bitwise offers a base configuration of
1MB RAM, a 20MB hard disk, a Hercules-compatible card, and monitor.&P;  All
prices include a one-year guarantee.&M;

One of the 333C's more interesting features is its drive bay arrangement,
which can hold either five half-height 5.25-inch drives or three half-height
5.25-inch and four half-height 3.5-inch drives.&P;  Three 5.25-inch bays and two
3.5-inch bays are accessible with the case on.&P;  In addition to its
flexibility, this design provides more room for expansion than you would
expect in an 18.8- by 6.5- by 15.8-inch system unit.&P;  But given the
capacities of currently available 3.5-inch hard disks, even the seven-bay
arrangement may prove barely adequate for a network or power user's system.&M;

Bitwise covered the two accessible 3.5-inch bays with dummy floppy disk
bezels, so that if you look at the review system from a distance, it seems to
have two 3.5-inch disk drives.&P;  In fact, our review system came with just the
floppy disk drive and the 100MB 3.5-inch hard disk, leaving two 5.25-inch
bays and three 3.5-inch bays still available.&P;  The turbo switch on the
ffronnt panel is also strictly decorative, since the system operates only at
33 MHz.&M;

Inside the box, the Klever Computers motherboard houses a standard set of
components, including a 33-MHz 80386 processor, AMI BIOS, a coprocessor
socket for an 80387, a combination of discrete logic plus one chip from the
Chips and Technologies chip set, and discrete logic for controlling the
system cache.&P;  Bitwise sells the unit with either 64K or 128K cache.&O;
However, our tested machine's 64K was more than adequate, considering that
the 333C's performance was among the best on PC Labs' processor and memory
benchmark tests.&M;

A WISE UPGRADE CHOICE&M;

The 333C takes only SIMM memory, in sixteen SIMM sockets on the motherboard.&O;
This notable extra lets you upgrade to the maximum 16MB without using a
system slot.&P;  The review unit had four 1MB SIMM modules installed.&P;  Also on
the motherboard are six 16-bit and two 8-bit slots.&P;  On our review system,
two were filled--one with a Trident 8916-2/4 Super VGA card (with both
interlaced and noninterlaced 8514/A modes), and one with a DTK PTI-217 disk
controller and I/O card.&P;  The DTK card had both a serial port and parallel
port on the card itself, plus a second serial port and game port connected by
cable.&P;  The additional connectors were mounted in two of the five connector
cutouts on the back panel, saving yet another slot.&M;

Scores on disk tests were well below average, but that's largely a functtion
of the 25-millisecond drive in our review unit.&P;  Results would presumably be
better with a faster drive.&P;  Performance on the video tests was slightly
better than average.&M;

Certainly the Bitwise 333C has more going for it than against it.&P;  The number
of bays may be limiting for some purposes, but the number of available slots
offers more room for expansion than many systems.&P;  And even with the handicap
of a relatively slow disk, the overall performance is still better than
average.&P;  For most purposes, this 33-MHz 386 is a good, if not outstanding,
choice.&O;

<SUMMARY>Blue Star Marketing's Blue Star 80386-33 microcomputer has
below-average performance and price, but its support services are
excellent.&P;  The $3,749 test configuration includes 4Mbytes of RAM,
a 64Kbytes SRAM cache, a 150Mbyte hard drive, a 1.2Mbyte or
1.44Mbyte floppy drive and a Super VGA card and monitor.&P;  The
Caching Technologies motherboard has a 32-bit slot for a memory
card.&P;  The standard card takes up to 8Mbytes of DIP RAM, but a $65
replacement board holds up to 16 1Mbyte Single Inline Memory
Modules (SIMMs).&P;  The second serial port and the game port on the
standard multifunction board block the use of one slot, so the AT
I/O Plus card should be requested instead.&P;  The desktop case holds
five half-height 5.25-inch drives.&P;  Blue Star gives a five-year
warranty on the motherboard and memory and a one-year warranty on
the other system components.&P;  TRW on-site service and phone
support are included.&M;

Blue Star Marketing Blue Star 80386-33 Blue Star Marketing's desktop 80386-33
is strong on both service and support.&P;  And if its performance is on the low
side of average, well then, so is the price.&M;

Included in the $3,749 standard configuration are 4MB RAM, a 64K cache, a
150MB Seagate hard disk, a 1.2MB or 1.44MB floppy disk drive, an NEC 3D
monitor, a Paradise VGA 1,024 card (with up to 1,024-by-768 resolution), a
Nan Tan 101-key keyboard, one parallel, one game, and two serial ports, and
DOS 4.01.&P;  Our review unit came with two floppy disk drives, boosting the
system price to a still low $3,849.&P;  For those who like to design their own
systems, Blue Star offers a $1,839 basic configuration with 1MB RAM, no
cache, one floppy disk drive, one parallel, one game, two serial ports, and a
keyboard.&M;

The Caching Technologies' motherboard leans heavily on VLSI technology with
its lower power requirements.&P;  The board is dominated relatively few large
chips, including the 80386, the Chips and Technologies chip set, the Intel
82385 cache controller, and a coprocessor socket for an 80387 or Weitek 3167.&O;
Also on the board is an AMI BIOS and 64K of 25-nanosecond cache.&P;  Although
the system can take either 32K or 64K of cache, Blue Star Marketing sells it
only with 64K.&M;

MEMORY CHOICES&M;

All system memory goes on a card that plugs into the motherboard's 32-bit
slot.&P;  Be aware that there are two memory cards available; one takes a
maximum of 8MB of DIP RAM and the other takes a maximum of sixteen 1MB SIMMs.&O;
Our review unit came with the DIP memory card, with 4MB of RAM in the form of
1MB chips.&P;  however, if you buy this system, it is good idea to get the SIMM
card instead.&P;  It costs only $65 more and the price of RAM is the same for
either DIP or SIMM memory.&M;

In addition to the 32-bit memory slot, the motherboard provides two 8-bit
slots and five 16-bit slots.&P;  On our review unit, three of these were filled
with the Paradise Super VGA card, the Data Technology Corp. DTC 6280 ESDI
disk controller, and the parallel-serial card.&P;  Also, one slot was blocked by
the second serial port and game port, which attach to the parallel-serial
card.&P;  This left our review unit with a paltry three slots free for
expansion.&P;  According to Blue Star, there is an alternative I/O card that
takes advantage of the connector cutouts on the back of the system to free up
a slot.&P;  Be sure to specify the AT I/O Plus card if you order this system.&M;

The Blue Star's desktop case measures 6.5 by 19.3 by 17 inches.&P;  It has the
usual drive bay arrangement of three half-height bays plus two--with three
bays accessible with the cover on.&P;  Four of the bays were filled with the
full-height 150MB Seagate drive and two half-height Toshiba floppy drives,
leaving just one bay for expansion.&M;

One of the Blue Star 80386-33's strongest advantage is its service and
support.&P;  The system comes with a five-year warranty for the motherboard and
memory and a one-year warranty for everything else.&P;  Support includes phone
service with parts shipping, back-up on-site service through TRW, and the
option to return the unit to your dealer or to Blue Star Marketing for
repair.&M;

The Blue Star 80386-33 turned in lack-luster results on PC Labs benchmark
tests.&P;  In nearly every case it performed below average.&P;  The one exception
was the video test scores, which were slightly better than average.&M;

The bottom line?&P;  The Blue Star 80386-33's average performance matches the
machine's average price.&P;  It's hard to recommend unless you can get it for
well under its list price.&P;  The service and support policies are an
inarguable strength, butthey are counterbalanced by the merely adequate
performance and the somewhat limited room for expansion.&O;

Brain Computer Corp. The Brain 386-33 If you wouldn't mind other people
pointing to your computer and referring to it as "The Brain" in your office,
you might want to take a look at this 33-MHz machine.&P;  The Brain 386-33 is
overall a decent performer, with the added plus of a hot video board with 1MB
of video RAM and the excellent Tseng ET4000 chip set.&P;  The only drawback to
the reasonably-priced Brain machine is its full-size desktop case with rough
finished support pieces and relatively limited drive expansion room.&M;

Our $3,820 test system came with 4MB RAM, a 32K processor RAM cache, a
Seagate/CDC/Imprimis 160MB, 16-millisecond IDE hard disk, and both 1.2MB and
1.44MB Chinon floppy disk drives.&P;  The Tseng video board pairs well with the
NEC 2A 800-by-600 Super VGA monitor.&P;  Also included in the system price are a
Unitek 101-key keyboard, one parallel, one game, and two serial ports, and
DOS 4.01.&M;

The Brain system uses a Cache brand motherboard with an OPTI 386 chip set
that incorporates the processor RAM cache controller internally.&P;  The RAM
cache comes standard with 64K of 25-nanosecond SRAM, but that can be
increased to 128K.&P;  The system uses AMI ROM BIOS chips with video and system
ROM BIOS shadowing, both selectable through the CMOS setup program.&P;  There's
a single socket to handle either an 80387 33-MHz math coprocessor or a Weitek
3167 unit.&M;

While the company sells as system with as little as 1MB on board, the Brain's
motherboard has sockets for a full 16MB of RAM.&P;  Our tested unit had 60-ns.&O;
chips installed, but even 80-ns.&P;  chips should achieve the same results with
the RAM cache and the motherboard's interleaved page-mode circuitry.&M;

The system's performance on the video benchmark tests was among the top
quarter of machines reviewed here.&P;  Its processor test scores were slightly
below average, but that was balanced by the above average Conventional Memory
test results.&P;  The small-record DOS File Access test score was about average,
as was the BIOS Disk Seek score; however, the large-record DOS File Access
time was among the slowest.&M;

The Brain 386-33 case is standard AT-style unit with the power switch on the
right side and the reset button and keyboard lock on the front.&P;  It measures
6.5 by 21 by 16.8 inches, and has space for five half-height 5.25-inch
drives, three of which can use removable storage media.&P;  Five drives is
probably enough for most single users, but they'd probably rather see them
packaged in a more appropriate small-footprint case.&P;  Additionally, the
Powertronic 200-watt power supply has only four device power leads.&M;

Inside The Brain 386-33 are two 8-bit slots and six 16-bit slots.&P;  In our
test unit, after the video adapter and the combination IDE drive interface
and I/O card were installed, six slots were free.&P;  That's one more than
average for most computers in this category, and there's the added advantage
of not having to take up any of them with memory cards.&M;

Brain Computer is a relatively new company, founded earlier this year.&P;  It
sells directly via telephone and mail order and through a limited direct
sales force to corporate accounts.&P;  The standard one-year parts-and-labor
warranty is backed by free on-site service from General Electric.&P;  There's
also a 30-day money-back guarantee.&M;

It's hard to ignore the appeal of the system's excellent video performance
and overall decent benchmark test scores, as well as its motherboard memory,
expansion slot capacity, and low price.&P;  The Brain is a system to
consider--particularly if you can get it in a small-footprint case.&O;

8Mbytes of RAM can be held by the Datatech Enterprises
motherboard.&P;  Another 8Mbytes of RAM can be stored on a 32-bit
memory board.&P;  The 32-bit slot can be used as an 8-bit expansion
slot if the memory board is not used.&P;  The tower case and the
desktop case both hold five half-height 5.25-inch drive bays.&P;  An
expansion slot was blocked by the game port and second serial
port, but BSI can provide cables to connect the ports to separate
connector cutouts.&P;  BSI includes a one-year parts and service
warranty and phone support.&M;

BSI BSI 386-33 The BSI 386-33's $3,319 standard configuration list price may
be one of the least expensive in this review, but here low price does not
mean low performance.&P;  In selected tests, the 386-33 performed in the top
tier of all machines reviewed and scored better than average overall.&M;

For this review, BSI supplied us with a system that included a BSI Super VGA
card and a TVM SuperSync monitor (both capable of up to 1,024-by-768
resolution), 4MB of RAM, 64K of 25-nanosecond cache (which can be upgraded to
256K), a 1.2MB floppy disk drive, a 16-millisecond 158MB Micropolis hard
disk, a Fujitsu 101-key keyboard, one parallel, one game, and two serial
ports, and DOS 4.01.&P;  You can substitute a 1.44MB drive for the 1.2MB unit
for the same price.&M;

Our review machine came with a 21.5-by 7.3- by 19-inch tower case.&P;  The
company's $1,839 basic configuration--with 1MB of RAM, a 64K cache, 40MB hard
disk, and Hercules-compatible card and monitor--comes in an AT-style case.&O;
However, there is little practical difference between the two, since both
have five half-height drive bays, three of which are accessible with the
cover on.&P;  In our review unit, two bays were filled with the Panasonic floppy
disk drive and micropolis hard disk.&P;  The three remaining bays may be enough
for a network or power user, but just barely.&M;

SOLID AND STANDARD&M;

The construction provides solid support for the Datatech Enterprises
motherboard, without any flexing at all.&P;  The motherboard houses the
80386/33, the AMI BIOS, a coprocessor socket for an 80387 or Weitek 3167, and
a combination of discrete logic plus one chip from the VLSI chip set.&O;
Elsewhere on the PC's motherboard are eight SIMM sockets.&P;  Anything over 8MB
of RAM goes on a memory board that allows a system maximum of 16MB.&M;

The 32-bit memory slot can also function as an 8-bit slot.&P;  In addition, the
motherboard offers six 16-bit slots and one 8-bit slot, for a typical
eight-slot total.&P;  On the review unit, three slots were filled with the Super
VGA card, the disk controller card, and a serial-parallel card.&P;  Yet another
slot was tied up with the game port and second serial port attached to the
serial-parallel board by ribbon cable.&P;  However, according to BSI, you can
avoid tying up a slot by getting cables that go to the additional connector
cutouts on the back panel.&P;  If you buy this unit, be sure to order it that
way.&M;

On PC Labs' processor and memory benchmark tests and on the disk tests,
scores varied from among the best of the field to slightly below average.&O;
The video scores were midrange or below.&P;  That can't take away from the fact
that the performance is more than you might expect for the price.&M;

The one-year warranty for parts and service includes phone support with parts
shipping, as well as the usual option to return the unit to the manufacturer
or dealer.&M;

If price is no object, you can easily find systems with better performance or
more expandability, but the BSI 386-33 offers a combination of price,
performance, and support that makes it a more than reasonable choice.&P;  If
you're on a budget, you'll find that this is a lot of computer for the price.&O;

CAF Technology Inc. CAF Master 386C/33T If money's tight and you're willing
to live with a few limitations, the CAF Master 386C/33t from CAF technology
provides a way to get into the 33-MHz game at a budget price.&P;  The machine
offers a mix of features that include a tower case, more drive bays but fewer
slots than usual, a notably low price and, unfortunately, lower than average
performance.&M;

CAF's version of the PC Magazine standard configuration is just $3,079.&O;
Included at this price is 4MB RAM, 64K of 25-nanosecond cache, a 150,MB hard
disk, a 1.2MB floppy disk drive, a Hisland Super VGA card and ADI monitor
(both with up to 1,024-by-768 resolution), a Fujitsu 101-key keyboard, one
parallel, one game, and two serial ports, and DOS 4.01.&P;  You can substitute a
1.44MB floppy disk drive at the same price.&P;  Our review unit added a second
floppy disk drive for a system price of $3,179.&P;  And for those who like to
start with a stripped-down system, $1,575 will get you the same case and
keyboard with 1MB RAM, 64K cache, one floppy disk drive, one parallel, one
game, and two serial ports.&P;  All prices include a one-year warranty and phone
service with parts shipping, though the only backup to the phone service is
to return the system to CAF.&M;

The 24.5- by 7.5- by 17-inch (HWD) tower offers reasonably solid
construction, though there is a slight flexing with the cover off.&P;  Under the
category of intelligent design, you'll find six half-height drive bays in a
single stack, so that you can fill them with any combination of half-height
or full height drives.&P;  And since all six bays are accessible with the cover
on, there is plenty of room for such additions as Bernoulli drives, tape
drives, or optical drives.&P;  Alas, you may run out of expansion slots before
you run out of bays because the CAF Technology motherboard has only seven
slots.&M;

Only two of our review unit's slots were filled, one with the Hisland Super
VGA card and the other with a Western Digital ESDI controller card.&P;  A third
slot should have been filled with the parallel-serial card, except that CAF
accidentally shipped the system without one.&P;  Additional connectors cabled to
the card do not block another slot, since there is an extra slot cover on teh
back panel.&P;  Of the four remaining slots, one can function as either a 16-bit
or a 32-bit memory card slot.&P;  If you want to upgrade the system to its full
16MB, you only have three slots left for expansion.&P;  Add a tape drive, a fax
board, and a bus mouse, and you've filled this system to capacity.&M;

The CAF Technology motherboard provides eight SIMM sockets for up to 8MB of
RAM.&P;  On our review unit, for of these were filled with 70-ns.&P;  SIMMs,
yielding the 4MB total.&P;  The motherboard also held the 33-MHz 80386
processor, 64K cache RAM, AMI BIOS, a socket for an 80387 coprocessor, and
discrete logic serving for both system and cache control.&M;

Performance was lower than average.&P;  Although the system scored well on the
memory test, all other results were well off pace.&P;  In general, it scored
significantly bettern than the worst performers, but significantly worse than
the best.&M;

All told, the CAF Master 386C/33T cuts a few corners (particularly in leaving
out the eighth slot), but it avoids any truly fatal flaws and may be just the
machine for those on a tight budget.&O;

Clone Computers Clone 386-33C If you think of a clone computer as a generic
term with a lowercase c, you've probably never seen a system from Clone
Computers.&P;  Consider, for example, its Clone 386-33C, a unit that delivers
high-quality construction, more drive bays than most, better-than-average
performance, and a PC Magazine standard configuration list price of only
$3,684.&M;

The mini-tower case that is included in thi price is actually a $75 upgrade
from a desktop case; while you can get the latter, Clone says that the
mini-tower is more representative of its 386 sales.&P;  Our review machine also
included 4MB of 70-nanosecond RAM, 64K of 25-ns.&P;  cache, a 160MB Imprimus
hard disk, an STB Systems Super VGA card and Liton monitor (both with
resolutions up to 1,024-by-768), a Focus Electronics 101-key keyboard, one
parallel, one game, and two serial ports, DOS 4.01, and Windows 3.0.&P;  Note
that our review unit lists for $3,763 because of the presence of a second
floppy disk drive.&P;  Clone does provide a $1,599 base model for those who
prefer to start with a stripped-down system--it includes only the desktop
case, a keyboard, 1MB RAM, a 64K cache, one floppy disk drive, and one
parallel, one game, and two serial ports.&M;

DRIVE DESIGN TWIST&M;

The 15.8- by 8.8- by 20-inch mini-tower case provides some very attractive
details, such as high-quality construction and a second fan that, in addition
to the fan on the power supply, helps keep temperatures low and so prolongs
component life.&P;  An interesting design twist is the way the case provides for
up to six drives.&P;  In addition to five half-height bays in the front, all in
one stack, there is a rail for mounting one half-height drive vertically,
next to the expansion cards.&P;  The positioning means you have to remove the
drive to get at the cards, but for most people, this isnt't an issue.&M;

Our review unit's Mek-Fab motherboard contained an 80386-33 processor, AMI
BIOS, a combination chip set and cache controller from OPTI, a 64K cache, and
a coprocessor socket that supports an 80387, Weitek 3167, or both on a Weitek
daughterboard.&P;  The motherboard also had eight slots and eight SIMM sockets;
four sockets were filled with 1MB SIMM models.&P;  If you need more than 8MB,
you have to get a 32-bit memory card, which will let you raise the system
total to a maximum of 16MB.&P;  According to Clone Computers, the memory card
uses DIP-type RAM.&M;

The system slots include one 8-bit and six 16-bit slots, and a 32-bit memory
slot that can also serve as an 8-bit slot.&P;  On our review system, three slots
were filled, one with the Super VGA card, another with a Western Digital ESDI
disk controller, and the third with the I/O card with one serial port and the
game port.&P;  Connectors for the parallel port and second serial port are
mounted in the connector cutouts on the back panel.&M;

To say that the Clone 386-33C's performance is respectable is something of an
understatement.&P;  On PC Labs' benchmark tests, the Clone 386-33C scored far
better than average overall.&P;  It was one of the best performers on the video
tests and the memory test and was not far off the mark on the processor
tests.&P;  The machine achieved some of the best disk test scores, if you ignore
systems with caching controllers.&M;

At this writing, clone's one-year warranty is limited to phone support with
parts shipping and return to the manufacturer if necessary.&P;  However, by the
time this is published, Clone expects to have on-site service available as a
backup to phone support.&P;  One nice touch is that the warranty can be extended
to five years for a relatively low premium ($649 for the review unit).&M;

The Clone rates as a high-quality package, and it will become even more so
once the on-site service is added.&P;  The combination of performance, quality
construction, support, and price is rare.&P;  And that makes it well worth your
attention.&O;

CompuAdd Corp. CompuAdd 333T By any measure, the CompuAdd 333T from CompuAdd
Corp. qualifies as a heavy-duty system for serious computing.&P;  Whether you're
looking for lots of drive bays, plenty of free slots for expansion, quality
construction, uniformly fast performance, or an FCC Class B rating, the 333T
has it.&P;  Even better, this full-size tower offers all these features at a
nearly midrange price of $5,975 for the PC Magazine standard configuration.&M;

Our tested configuration included 4MB of 80-nanonsecond RAM, 64K of 15-ns.&O;
cached RAM, a 150MB Seagate hard disk, 1.2MB and 1.44MB floppy disk drives, a
CompuAdd Hi-Rez VGA card and a Seiko CM 1440 Super VGA monitor (both with up
to 1,024-by-768 interlaced resolution), a Mitsumi 101-key keyboard, one
parallel and two serial ports, DOS 4.01, and Windows 3.0.&P;  The system also
came with 1,024K RAM on the video card rather than the usual 512K, increasing
the system's price to $6,024.&P;  All prices include one-year on-site service
through Memorex-Telex.&M;

(UN)CONVENTIONAL SRAM&M;

The CompuAdd 333T features an SRAM board that provides 640K of 25-ns.&P;  SRAM
as conventional memory.&P;  While the system comes in its stripped down version
without the board, CompuAdd says that the motherboard was in fact designed
around the SRAM, and that it is considered an integral part of the system.&O;
In any case, the board is included in the CompuAdd package that most closely
matches our standard configuration, and we included it as part of the review
unit.&M;

Similarly, the company says that the motherboard is also designed around
CompuAdd's caching controller.&P;  Not only does the controller provide caching
for the disk drive, it operates at the equivalent of 12.5 MHz, but only in a
specially designed hot slot.&P;  The bus speed is 8 MHz, but setting a jumper
changes the wait state setting for the hot slot, yielding the equivalent of
12.5 MHz.&P;  Here again, because the hot slot and caching controllr are central
to the system design, we allowed the controller as part of the review unit.&O;
(The motherboard also has a second has slot for the CompuAdd video card.)&M;

On the PC Labs benchmark tests, the 333T handed in just the kind of
performance you would expect from the SRAM card and the caching controller.&O;
It is certainly among the fastest of the 33-MHz machines we've tested.&P;  It
scored the best time in the group, or close to it, on every test we put it
through, boasting the best overall performance in the field.&M;

Performance isn't the 333T's only virtue.&P;  The case, for example, features
quality construction throughout.&P;  And the 25.8- by 8- by 19-inch tower design
leaves ample room for expansion.&P;  Our review system had four half-height bays
filled with a full height 150MB hard disk and two floppy drives, and there
were still five empty bays left over.&P;  The nine half-height bays come in one
stack of six and one of three.&M;

CompuAdd's motherboard also houses the 33-MHz 80386, the Phoenix BIOS, 64K
cache, a coprocessor socket for an 80387 or Weitek 3167, and discrete logic
serving for the chipset and cache controller.&P;  Also on the motherboard are
the slot for the SRAM board, six 16-bits slots, one 8-bit slot, and a
dedicated 32-bit memory slot.&P;  The memory board has 16 SIMM sockets, for a
maximum of 16MB.&P;  Four 1MB SIMM modules on our review system, plus the 640K
SRAM board, brought the system up to a total of 4,736 kilobits of RAM.&P;  Even
with the memory board, VGA card, and disk controller installed, the 333T
still has five free slots, thanks to an extension to the motherboard that
includes the parallel port and two serial ports.&M;

Its obvious that there is a lot to like here and very little to dislike.&O;
About the only trick CompuAdd missed is providing support for both the Weitek
and the 80387, but that won't be an issue for most users.&P;  Whether you're
looking for a network server or a power user's dream machine, this
combination of performance, quality construction, and expandability will be
hard to beat at any reasonable price.&O;

Computer Marketplace Inc. Ultra 386C-33 People at PC Labs walked around the
jet-black Ultra 386C-33, humming a familiar movie score.&P;  Indeed, the way the
Ultra dwarfed PCs of lesser stature made it resemble the monolith from the
movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.&P;  Now, imagine putting that monolith to use,
configuring it exactly, not giving up any performance, and still spending
less than expected.&P;  This accurately describes the Ultra 386C-33, which had a
tested version at the bargain price of $3,995.&M;

If you can tear your eyes away from the solidly constructed, imposing black
case measuring 23- by 7.5- by 18-inches (HWD), you should look inside.&O;
Computer Marketplace's emphasis on configuring machines to personal
preference does not extend to offering shoddy components.&P;  The only real
complaint to be lodged against the machine is the way it is finished inside;
loose, knotted, and sloppily tie-wrapped cabling and wires detract from an
otherwise professional job.&P;  The low price is no excuse and according to the
company, the factor is now in the process of rectifying it.&M;

Orchid Technology provides the motherboard, VLSI the chip set, and AMI the
BIOS, which can be shadowed in both the video and system modes.&P;  Expansion
capabilities are more than adequately handled, with two 8-bit and five 16-bit
slots, plus a 32-bit slot for a proprietary memory board.&P;  The motherboard
also supports either an 80387 or Weitek 3167 coprocessor chip, though not
concurrently.&M;

In a move that is rapidly becoming a standard for machines of this class, the
Ultra offers an Intel 32K disk cache, consisting of four 8K chips.&P;  Unlike
other systems, the Ultra's cache cannot be altered in any way, but
performance is anything but downgraded.&P;  The 386C-33 stayed well into the top
third of the machines PC Labs tested, proving that top speed does not
necessarily require top dollar.&M;

The Ultra 386C-33's tested version came with 4MB of RAM, expandable to 8MB on
the motherboard, packaged in 1MB 80-nanosecond DRAM.&P;  An available $129
proprietary 32-bit add-in board will allow you to boost RAM up another 8MB.&O;
Upgrades to 2, 4, 8, and 16MB are $149, $298, $596, and $1,192, respectively.&O;
Here lies a weak spot for the Ultra--power users utilizing CAD or DTP
programs will be right at the edge of their RAM limits.&P;  Though its current
RAM allotment can hardly be considered a liability, this machine needs more
RAM capability if it is to meet these specialized needs.&M;

In terms of mass storage, the 386C-33 has things more adequately covered.&O;
The system can have a 1.4GB hard disk installed, though at nearly the price
of the machine as tested.&P;  More down-to-earth hard disk options exist.&P;  The
tested version came with a Micropolis 150MB hard disk, with an integrated
Western Digital controller for the TEAC 1.2MB floppy and the Toshiba 1.44MB
floppy.&P;  Also available is a 32K Conan cache controller, though it was not
installed on the tested unit.&M;

The Ultra also featured PC Power and Cooling's excellent 300-watt power
supply, as well as a crisp CTX Super VGA monitor.&P;  Deserving special mention
is the Focus Electronics FK-5001 keyboard.&P;  The 386C-33 also came generously
endowed with software, featuring DOS 4.01 and Windows 3.0 with a Microsoft
serial mouse.&M;

Computer Marketplace also doesn't ignore the service aspect of its business:
In a nice display of nonstandard support behavior, the company offers a full
two-year parts-and-labor warranty with Phoenix Service Technology as its
on-site service agent.&M;

Computer Marketplace has put together a remarkably competent machine for the
price.&P;  As a total package of possible configurations, price, and support,
the Ultra 386C-33 can please even the most jaundiced PC buyer.&P;  It's a
machine worthy of your consideration.&O;

Core International Core 386/33 Core has long been a power player in the PC
game.&P;  Its latest machine, the Core 386/33, continues in that tradition.&O;
Though somewhat pricey at $10,785 in PC magazine's standard configuration
(4MB RAM, a 64K disk cache, a 150MB Core ESDI hard disk and integrated
hard/floppy drive controller card, TEAC's 1.2MB floppy disk drive,
Mitsubishi's 1.44MB floppy drive, a VGA monitor, and one parallel and two
serial ports), the Core 386/33 is a big, brawny machine endowed with lots of
room for expansion and the speed to make it all work.&P;  As a file server or
CAD platform, the Core 386/33's abilities are every bit as good, if not
better, than many of its competitors.&M;

Core has the basics down right.&P;  Inside the rugged 386/33's 23- by 9- by
24-inch (HWD) tower case, Core has installed a Micronics motherboard.&P;  Chips
and TEchnologies provides the chip set, and Phoenix the BIOS that can shadow
in both video and system modes.&M;

Core's own motherboard recognizes the need for expansion by intelligently
providing two 8-bit and five 16-bit slots.&P;  It also has an additional slot
for a proprietary 32-bit memory expansion card.&P;  The slots are mounted at the
top of the motherboard and getting to them is a fairly simple exercise.&P;  As
configured for the benchmark tests, with video card, floppy controllers and
I/O, there still remained five slots, though two were of the less handy 8-bit
variety.&P;  The Core 386/33 also provides for an 80387 or Weitek 3167 math
coprocessor.&M;

Core's quest for breakneck performance accounts for the built-in 64K cache,
using an Intel chip set.&P;  Since memory is always an issue with power users,
the 4MB of RAM provided in the test system is also a feature echoed in the
most basic configuration of the 386/33 (which does not, however, include a
hard disk).&P;  RAM can be expanded to 16MB, employing 1MB SIMM chips rated at
80ns.&P;  RAM can be boosted a further 8MB--using 1MB DPS chips--by installing
the memory expansion card.&M;

Further reinforcing the idea of the 386/33 as a file server, Core makes a
provisions in the tower configuration for up to ten half-height drives to be
installed within the chassis, though at the cost of precious 16-bit slots for
the interface cards.&P;  A good selection of Core's own tape drives is
available, ranging in capacity from 150MB to 2GB.&M;

The 386/33 more than meets its video needs; Paradise provides both the 16-bit
card and chip set for the VGA system, while a very good Mitsubishi monitor
handles output duties.&P;  Rounding out the impressive specifications of the
386/33 is a powerful 250-watt, switchable Skynet power supply and a superb
Focus Electronics keyboard, one of the nicest keyboards around.&M;

The unit doesn't provide a mouse, as Core does not bundle Windows with the
machine, though it does include an expanded memory manager, some disk
utilities, partitioning software, and Novell, OS/2, and Xenix drivers.&P;  The
relatively high price of the Core 386/33 does nit include any operating
software, though DOS 4.01 can be bought for $119.&M;

Service for this Class A-rated machine is the standard fare for the
industry--one year's parts and labor and TRW on-site service, with phone
back-up.&M;

If you look at the Core 386/33 as a pack mule with exceptional legs, you're
not too far off the mark, though admittedly at a price.&P;  This machine just
about has it all--well-proven components, all the speed a user could want, a
standard warranty and real expansion ability.&P;  The very capable 386/33
reinforces Core's position as a heavy hitter.&O;

the price.&P;  The system includes 4Mbytes of RAM, a 64Kbyte SRAM
cache, a 150Mbyte hard disk, 1.2Mbyte and 1.44Mbyte floppy drives
and a VGA board and monitor.&P;  The FCC Class B-rated case has a
door over the front panel that makes the drives warmer than usual.&O;
The Hauppauge motherboard holds only 4Mbytes, but a 32-bit
proprietary expansion slot holds 8Mbytes of RAM, and five 4Mbyte
daughterboards can increase the system RAM to 32Mbytes.&P;  The
386/33 will support Intel 80387 and Weitek 3167 math coprocessors
simultaneously.&P;  The warranty covers parts for two years and labor
for one year.&P;  The dealer provides on-site service.&M;

CSR Inc. CSR 386/33 With the CSR 386/33, flexibility is the name of the game.&O;
The machine can assume one of three different configurations--a tower,
mini-tower, or desktop--but the unifying feature that all the models enjoy is
the reassurance of reliable components inside, good performance and service,
and a relatively low price.&P;  As a file server host or as a CAD platform, the
CSR 386/33 would make an intelligent choice.&M;

The 386/33 mini-tower we tested lists for $5,299, including 4MB RAM, an
Imprimis-built CDC 150MB hard disk, a Western Digital combined hard/floppy
disk controller, both Toshiba 1.2MB and 1.44MB floppy drives, a VGA monitor,
and DOS 4.01.&P;  Other hardware includes an Aztec 200-watt power supply and a
terrifically clicky Focus Electronics keyboard.&M;

Measuring 15- by 8.5- by 17-inches (HWD), CSR's 386/33 doesn't take up much
space.&P;  The machine is nicely styled in the fron, featuring an LED display,
as well as other control functions and the two disk drives.&M;

A door that covers the panel when access isn't required drew mixed
reviews--it seems precariously attached and keeping it closed during extended
use made the drives warmer to the touch than normal.&P;  The rest of the chassis
is well-constructed and up to long-term use.&M;

CSR's commitment to making the machine perform well is readily apparent.&O;
Internally, the Hauppauge motherboard, Chips and Technologies chipset, and
the Award 3.03 BIOS--which can be shaddowed in both system and video
modes--reflects this, just as the number of available expansion slots does.&O;
You will find two 8-bit and six 16-bit slots, plus a proprietary 32-bit slot
for an add-in memory card on the motherboard.&P;  Even when configured for the
review, with video, floppy/hard drive controller and I/O (one parallel and
two serial ports) installed, the CSR had five slots open, though two were
eight bit--a common failing in machines of this class.&M;

LOADS OF BUILT-IN MEMORY&M;

The real strength of this machine, making it particularly attractive to CAD
users, is the amount of memory CSR has built into it.&P;  The company starts
with a non-adjustable Inter 64K cache comprised of eight 8K chips.&P;  A maximum
of 4MB RAM is available on the motherboard, and an optional 32-bit
proprietary add-in card ($253) can add another 8MB of RAM to the mix.&P;  Five
optional daughterboards, at a cost of $227 each, are necessary to bring the
machine up to 32MB.&P;  Each of the daughterboards holds up to 4MB; the RAM
upgrade costs $235.&P;  Adding to the appeal of the CSR is the fact that it will
support both an 80387 and a Weitek 3167 simultaneously.&M;

Performance in benchmark testing placed the CSR in the top quarter of the
machines in the roundup--fast access being important in any application.&P;  The
CSR also did well in video testing, owing in part to the Video Seven 16-bit
video card and chip set, which plugs into a NEC 2A monitor.&M;

Since CSR sells mostly through dealers, service is done primarily through
them.&P;  The warranty runs for two years on parts and one year on labor, and
includes a year's on-site service from your dealer.&P;  CSR also maintains an
800 number for factory technical support.&M;

The CSR 386/33 makes very few compromises on the way to delivering
satisfaction.&P;  Its price is impressive, particularly considering its generous
RAM accommodations and good performance as well as class B FCC approval.&P;  For
a real price/performance value, you need look no further.&O;

Digital Equipment Corp. DECstation 333c Digital Equipment Corp. has long
maintained a low-key presence in the DOS marketplace; in fact, its DECstation
333c is manufactured by Tandy.&P;  The machine lists for $6,540 in its tested
configuration, including 4MB RAM, a 32K cache, a 1.44 MB Sony floppy disk
drive, a 170MB Imprimis SCSI hard disk rated at 19 milliseconds, a Super VGA
adapter and Super VGA display, DOS 4.01, and Quarterdeck's QEMM memory
manager.&P;  Leave out the hard disk, the video adapter, the monitor, and DOS,
reduce the RAM to 1MB, and you wind up with the machine in its $4,640 basic
configuration.&M;

The Tandy tie-in offers a reasonable guarantee of both reliability and IBM
compatibility.&P;  Inside the handsomely styled small desktop machine, the Tandy
influence is readily apparent, as the company supplies the motherboard that
contains sepaate Adaptec hard disk and Tandy floppy disk drive controllers.&O;
Chips and Technologies provides the 386 chip set, and Phoenix the BIOS.&P;  The
BIOS cannot be shadowed in system and video modes.&P;  The motherboard supports
both an 80387 and a Weitek 3167 math coprocessor, but not simultaneously.&M;

The chassis is finished like a vault; it's as rugged and well though-out as
they come.&P;  You'll find one parallel and two serial ports, but don't look for
a turbo switch--there isn't one.&P;  A mechanical lock lets you secure the case
but not the keyboard.&P;  You can protect the latter through a
software-supported password.&M;

One of the inherent disadvantages of small-footprint machines is the physical
limitations placed on expandability.&P;  The 6.3- by 17- by 16-inch DECstation
333c does not escape this.&P;  Two of its six 16-bit slots can be configured to
accept 32-bit memory expansion cards; with a video adapter, an I/O
controller, and a memory board installed in three slots and the drive
controllers housed on the system board, our evaluation unit had three 16-bit
slots remaining.&P;  Potential users will have to carefully weigh their options
when it comes time to fill the remaining slots.&M;

DEC equips the DECstation 333c with an Intel 82835 cache controller.&P;  Its
cache, which is fixed at 32K, helped to keep the machine in the top third of
those tested.&P;  The Tandy motherboard consigns system RAM to a $125 32-bit
add-in card, which uses 100-ns.&P;  SIMMs and supports up to 8MB of RAM.&P;  In
order to boost memory to the full 16MB usable by the system, you'll have to
buy a second proprietary add-in card from DEC.&M;

The chassis for the DEC supports up to four half-height devices.&P;  Next to the
three fron accessible drive bays and behind the face plate is another
3.5-inch drive bay.&P;  This expandability works well for the DEC; not many
small footprint machines allow this kind of flexibility.&M;

THE TANDY TOUCH&M;

Tandy Corp. makes itself known again, providing the DECstation's 16-bit Super
VGA card, a fairly fast adapter that uses the Paradise chip set.&P;  It's
connected through a 9-pin port to a 14-inch Matsushita Super VGA monitor
that's capable of a top pixel resolution of 1,024 by 768.&P;  The DECstation
33c's video performance is indicative of the rest of the machine: solid,
reliable, and component.&M;

The respectability of the DECstation 333's components extends to both the
power supply and the keyboard.&P;  Aztec provides the 200-watt power supply for
the machine, and Tandy, the 101-key keyboard, a singularly pleasant typing
device.&M;

Since the machine is manufactured by Tandy, you might think that you'll be
able to have it repaired at the nearest Radio Shack Computer Center.&P;  But
because the DECstation differs from Tandy's machines in several respects,
Tandy will not handle it.&P;  The DECstation's one-year parts-and-labor warranty
is standard fare for this clas of machine.&P;  If you have a defective unit or
part, you'll have to either ship it back to DEC or take it to a service
center for repair.&M;

All told, the FCC Class B-certified DECstation 333c is a well-made machine
that benefits by its association with two well-regarded companies: Tandy, for
components that are reliable if fairly conservative in execution; and
Digital, for its reputation for quality.&O;

Dynamics Decisions Inc. Dynex 386-33 It would be difficult to find a clunker
in Dynamic Decisions' lin of PCs, in part because the company uses proven if
unexciting technology.&P;  That combination works well for the Dynex 386-33, a
machine that's equally at home as a personal workstation or as a file server,
despite the lack of extensive disk and board expansion room.&M;

The Dynex 386-33 won't leave you gasping for breath after you hear its list
price.&P;  As tested, the system costs only $4,200, including 4MB RAM, a 64K
cache, two TEAC floppy disk drives (1.4MB and 1.2MB), a 150MB Micropolis ESDI
hard disk rated at 16 milliseconds, a Super VGA adapter and monitor, and DOS
3.3--a nice configuration for the money.&M;

At first glance, the big Dynex system unit looks like just another AT-size
clone.&P;  But inside the 5- by 21- by 17-inch case are all kinds of goodies
that some more-expensive machines don't have.&P;  AMI builds the motherboard and
the BIOS, and an outfit named Describe manufactures the chip set.&P;  The BIOS
supports both system and video BIOS shadowing through its setup utility.&P;  The
system will also support Intel 80387 and Weitek 1167 math coprocessors; an
optional daughterboard allows them to run at the same time.&M;

On the outside, you'll find that the Dynex 386-33 is also well equipped.&P;  On
the front panel are reset and turbo switches as well as an LED turbo
indicator and a mechanical keyboard lock.&M;

MONDO MEMORY&M;

Two features go a long way toward making the Dynex 386-33 an appealing
machine.&P;  First is the standard, nonadjustable 64K cache, which uses fast
15-nanosecond DRAM and adds real bite to the machine's performance.&P;  Overall,
the Dynex performed in the top third of the machines we tested.&M;

Second is the Dynex's ability to accommodate up to 28MB of RAM, which should
sate even the most memory-hungry applications.&P;  The motherboard will hold up
to 20MB using 1MB 70-ns.&P;  DIPs--16MB more than we had in our evaluation unit.&O;
You can add another 8MB of memory with an optimal ($199) 32-bit add-in board
that uses 1MB DIP chips.&M;

The Dynex offers eight slots: two 8-bit slots and six 16-bit slots, with the
first 8-bit slot doubling as a 32-bit slot for the proprietary memory card.&O;
With the video adapter, I/O controller, Western Digital WDC-1007V hard and
floppy disk controller, and memory board installed, our evaluation unit was
left with four slots for expansion.&P;  The machine offers space for up to five
half-height devices within the chassis, two of which are hidden behind the
face plate.&M;

The Dynex 386-33 did very well on PC Labs' video benchmark tests, performing
in the top third of the reviewed machines; ATI's 16-bit card and chip set see
to that.&P;  When coupled with the evaluation unit's 14-inch View Perfect Super
VGA monitor, the result is a top resolution of 1,024 by 768.&P;  The Dynex
386-33 also features a quiet Senstron 200-watt power supply, and the
company's own great 101-key keyboard.&M;

In addition to bundling DOS 3.3 with the system, Dynamic Decisions offers
Windows 3.0 for $99 and Microsoft Mouse for $55.&P;  The FCC Class B-certified
system comes with a one-year parts-and-labor warranty, along with the
considerable benefit of having TRW provide the on-site service.&M;

The Dynex 386-33 deserves your consideration--it may not offer the most drive
or card expansion room, but its huge memory capacity and good performance,
not to mention its price, make it a contender for single users or networked
operations on a budget.&O;

EPS Technologies Inc. EPS 386-33 That EPS Technologies has only been around
for a little more than a year should not discourage potential buyers from
considering its EPS 386-33.&P;  On paper and in our tests the machine gives up
nothing to its competitors.&M;

Outfitted to conform to our standard test configuration, the EPS 386-33 costs
$4,020 and comes with 4MB RAM, a 64K cache, a 160MB (formatted) Micropolis
ESDI hard disk, an Orchid ProDesigner II Super VGA adapter and Sony Super VGA
monitor, two TEAC floppy disk drives (1.2MB and 1.44MB), DOS 4.01, and
Quarterdeck's QEMM (with Manifest).&P;  In its basic configuration, the machine
costs $2,799 and includes 4MB RAM, a 64K cache, one 1.2MB floppy disk drive,
a 65MB Mitsubishi hard disk, a Hercules adapter, and a 14-inch amber monitor.&O;
Both setups feature one parallel, one game, and two serial ports.&M;

Inside the generously shielded and well-constructed 24- by 8- by 21-inch
tower chassis, EPS's own motherboard, a Chips and Technologies chip set, and
AMI BIOS provide the underpinnings for the 386-33.&P;  The BIOS supports system
and video BIOS shadowing and runs the I/O bus at 8, 11, and 16.5 MHz.&P;  The
motherboard can accept either an Intel 80387 or a Weitek 3167 math
coprocessor.&M;

HOME, HOME FOR THE RAM&M;

The EPS motherboard is also home for 8MB of interleaved page-mode system RAM,
which is packaged in the form of 1MB 80-nononsecond SIMMs.&P;  But the EPS
386-33 is even more generous with system memory, supporting up to 16MB with
the addition of an optional $169 32-bit add-in board.&M;

Using an Intel 82385 cache controller, the EPS 386-33 can accommodate either
32K or 64K of cache memory.&P;  Our evaluation unit was configured with 64K of
25-ns.&P;  static RAM.&M;

Of the EPS 386-33's eight slots, three are 8-bit, one of which will serve as
a 32-bit slot for a memory card, and five are 16-bit, with one of those a
slot designed to accommodate either a proprietary Super EMS or memory board.&O;
With video adapter, I/O controller, memory board, and integrated Adaptec hard
and floppy disk controller installed, you'll have four open slots--the bare
minimum you'd want for the types of work this machine will be called on to
do.&M;

EPS offers only a few hard drive options for the 386-33, but they are useful
choices that should serve the machine well.&P;  Starting with the base
configuration price, add $395 for a 118MB hard disk, $795 for a 345MB device,
and $2,195 for a 676MB unit.&P;  With three half-height drives installed, our
evaluation unit still had three empthy half-height drive bays.&M;

The EPS 386-33's strong showing in the PC Labs video benchmark tests can be
traced to its Orchid ProDesigner II 16-bit Super VGA video card, which uses a
Tseng Labs chip set.&P;  EPS bundles Sony's Super VGA monitor with the machine,
creating a reliable and powerful video package with a top pixel resolution of
1,024 by 768.&M;

EPS looks after the less-heralded parts of its 386-33 as well, powering the
machine with a quiet 220-watt Seasonic power supply.&P;  A Fujitsu 101-key
keyboard makes for comfortable typing.&M;

For a young company, EPS has managed to build an impressive service
infrastructure.&P;  Free on-site service is provided by TRW as part of a
one-year parts-and-labor warranty, and a toll-free number is also available
for technical support.&P;  EPS claims to have FCC Class B certification by the
time this article is published.&M;

The EPS 386-33 is a machine that is bursting with promise.&P;  Its strong
performance across the board on the PC Labs tests and good after-sales
support are evidence that EPS is committed to the long haul.&P;  As a flagship,
the 386-33 is a fine effort and should not be ignored.&O;

Everest Computer Corp. Everest Column 333 Professional Everest Computer Corp.&O;
is a name of convenience for the U.S.&P;  arm of Taiwan-based CMP Enterprises,
which manufactures the system board and most of the other components of the
Column 333 Professional.&P;  Although the company name evokes the idea of peak
performance, the moniker casts only a tall shadow on the Column 333 which was
the among the slower systems we tested.&P;  But even if it is not at the
pinnalce of its class, the $3.480 Column 333, including (as reviewed) 4MB
RAM, 64K cache RAM, a 1.2MB floppy disk drive, a 147MB IDE hard disk, a
proprietary Super VGA adapter and monitor, and DOS 4.01, is still a good buy.&M;

Nearly all of the Column 333's system board circuitry is made from discrete
logic chips, which alter the function of the one Chips and Technology VSLI
module on the board.&P;  One result of this design is the system's somewhat
laggardly performance on PC Labs' benchmark tests.&P;  Future versions of the PC
may get a boost from a redesign, which will provide for a scalable cache of
128K, 256K, or 512K of fast, 25-nanosecond static RAM, instead of the 64K
currently available.&M;

Up to 8MB of interleaved page-mode 60-ns.&P;  SIMMs of either 256K or 1MB
capacity fit on the system board.&P;  By seating an 8MB card in a proprietary
32-bit slot, you can stretch the system to its 16MB addressing limit.&P;  None
of that memory is used for video or system BIOS shadowing, which the Column
333 does not support.&M;

The system setup procedure is built into the machine's AMI BIOS and can be
entered when the Column 333 Professional is booting up.&P;  You can slow the
33-MHz 80386 microprocessor to 8.25-MHz, which is also the bus speed of the
system.&M;

The Column 333 earns its name from its 25-by 7.5-by 16.5-inch (HWD)
TOWER-style case, which provides ample room for expansion.&P;  Substituting a
desktop case, which Everest calls a "block," cuts the system cost by $125.&O;
The overall design and workmanship of the machine are good but not
remarkable.&P;  The chassis itself is brightly plated, and the few wires and
cables inside are neatly bundled together.&P;  An ill-fitting handle with
hand-grooving square corners retracts into the top of the case.&M;

Accommodations for disk and tape drives include six half-height 5.25-inch
bays, two of which are completely internal; for expansion boards, eight
full-size slots fill the bottom third of the case.&P;  The Column 333 even
provides cut-outs for four 9-pin and four 25-pin D-shell connectors on the
rear panel.&M;

After you pop off a decorative plastic rear panel from the case, you can
unscrew and slide off both the right and left side panels of the Column to
gain access to the screw slots on both sides of the system's top four drive
bays.&P;  Some parts of the Column 333 are more difficult to reach, however.&O;
for example, if you want to install either an Intel 80387 or 33-MHz Weitek
math coprocessor, you'll have to remove an internal bay to gain access to the
socket.&M;

The Column 333's front panel looks Spartan but includes the usual controls:
pushbuttons for turbo mode and reset; LED indicators for power, turbo
operation, and disk activity; a cylindrical keyboard-only lock; and a red
power switch.&M;

In its basic configuration, the system costs $2,185 and comes with 1MB RAM, a
64K cache, one 1.2MB or 1.44MB floppy disk drive, a Hercules adapter, a
14-inch TTL monitor, and a 40MB IDE hard disk.&P;  The Fujitsu hard disk in our
evaluation unit, a $385 upgrade, actually configures to 129MB of useful
storage.&P;  A Chicony CH-101B host adapter provides the IDE connection for
either drive as well as the one parallel and two serial ports that are
standard in the Column 333.&M;

Our evaluation system's Super VGA output is provided by an Everest 16-bit
adapter based on the Western Digital VGA chip.&P;  The Everest color display,
manufactured by Taiwan-based Intra Electronics Co., is a dual fixed-frequency
display (horizontal frequencies are 31.5 and 35.2 kHz) with a top resolution
of 1,024 by 768.&P;  The Nan Tan keyboard is a 102-key design with a loose,
clicky feel and a generous 10-foot cable.&M;

The power to run it all comes from a 235-watt supply with four drive
connectors that generates somewhat more wind noise than most.&P;  Both a 3-volt
battery soldered on to the system board and a holder filled with four AA
batteries attached by Velcro to its rear panel provide CMOS power for the
Column 333.&M;

The Column 333 delivers the look, feel, and performance of a budget computer.&O;
And that's exactly what this system is.&O;

a Super VGA board and monitor.&P;  The Fortron motherboard can hold
up to 32Mbytes of RAM in 36 DIP and four single inline memory
module (SIMM) sockets.&P;  A 32-bit daughterboard can hold up to

expansion slot.&P;  The NetSet's turbo switch, which should toggle
the processor's operation from 33 MHz to 8 MHz, rarely works.&P;  The
chassis is sturdy, but it has some sharp edges.&P;  The drive bays
and 220-watt power supply are arranged in the top of the case,

Fortron Source Corp. Fortron NetSet 333 Fortron Source's NetSet 333 will
accommodate more memory than even the greediest of today's applications will
demand--up to 64MB, split half on the system board and half in its single
proprietary 32-bit slot.&P;  Although the NetSet 333 placed in the bottom third
of the machines we reviewed, its Maxtor 160MB (151MB formatted) ESDI hard
disk delivers excellent performance.&P;  That, together with its RAM capacity,
makes the NetSet 333 a viable file server.&P;  At $3,945 for the tested system,
which included 4MB RAM, a 64K static RAM cache, a Fortron Super VGA adapter
and display, DOS 4.01, Windows 3.0, PC-Kwik disk caching software, and one
floppy disk drive in addition to the hard disk ($2,250 in its basic
configuration sans hard disk, video adapter, and monitor), Fortron Source's
entry is less expensive than dedicated servers from network vendors and will
likely suffer neither disgrace nor distinction in comparison.&M;

With only twin 3.5-inch and half-height 5.25-inch drive bays, the towering
24-by 6.5-by 17.8-inch (HWD) NetSet 333 has little more than adequate drive
capacity.&P;  At the top of the chassis is space for a full-height hard disk.&O;
Although this design uses space efficiently, it also makes the tower somewhat
top-heavy.&P;  Thus, you'll want to make sure that the NetSet 333 stands firmly
on its four flipper-like feet.&M;

Fortron's full AT-size system board, which is based on a Chips and Technology
chip set and discrete logic, houses the machine's vast array of memory in an
assortment of 36 DIP and four SIMM sockets.&P;  Both 1MB and 4MB DIP chips will
fit, as will 256K, 1MB, and 4MB SIMMs, for a total of 32MB on the system
board.&P;  Of the system's eight slots, the bottom-most accommodates either an
ordinary 8-bit expansion board or a proprietary 32-bit board with up to
another 32MB of 70-ns.&P;  interleaved page-mode RAM.&M;

The NetSet 333 uses a 64K cache of very fast 15-ns.&P;  static-RAM but to little
avail.&P;  Its performance on the PC Labs benchmark tests was about 6 percent
slower than that of the leader.&P;  The size of the cache is fixed.&M;

A socket for either an Intel 80387 or Weitek 3167 coprocessor is readily
accessible just above the expansion slots.&P;  Setup procedures are built into
the AMI BIOS, including facilities for disabling the system and video BIOS
shadowing.&M;

To show off its two-speed operation--33 MHz or 8 MHz--the NetSet 333 has a
large 6.25-inch LED speed display with a molded rectangular turbo switch
nearby.&P;  unfortunately, the switch proved only intermittently functional,
rarely changing the speed of the system.&M;

Fortron has chosen its disk subsystem well.&P;  The NetSet 333's 16.5-ms.&O;
Maxtor hard disk performed particularly well on the PC Labs DOS File Access
test, no doubt in part because of its Western Digital WD1007V-SE2ESDI
combined hard/floppy disk controller, which occupies a 16-bit slot.&P;  Two
other 16-bit slots in our evaluation unit held a proprietary I/O board, which
yields two serial, one parallel, and one game port, and a proprietary Super
VGA controller.&M;

The design and construction of the NetSet 333's chassis are good but not
exemplary.&P;  The unplated, unpainted steel fabrications are sturdy, but some
edges are sharp enough that you might cut yourself if you're not careful.&O;
All wiring is tie-wrapped into place, and the system board is generally
accessible.&P;  To add drives you will have to remove entire drive bays to
access hidden screw holes--an intricate maneuver.&M;

The Fortron 220-watt power supply offers four power connectors, three of
which were already used in our evaluation unit.&P;  A Tadrian 6.8-volt lithium
battery powers the CMOS and clock.&P;  Besides the four-inch fan in the power
supply, a second fan located near the bottom of the front panel and just
above the NetSet's tiny, two-inch loudspeaker helps to cool the system unit.&M;

The 101-key Fortron keyboard has a quiet touch and rubbery over-center
tactile feedback.&P;  The Fortron Super VGA monitor is actually a Tatung in
disguise.&P;  Its 13-inch screen delivers a bright, sharp image at a pixel
resolution of up to 1,024 by 768 (but at a slow 35.5 kHz horizontal
frequency).&P;  To cope with various video standards, the monitor has extra
horizontal phase and width controls below the front edge of its bezel and
vertical size and position controls on its rear panel.&M;

Backed by a one-year parts-and-labor warranty that include on-site service by
GE Computer Services, the NetSet 333 is a workable but not remarkable
computer.&P;  Although it has no major weaknesses, it lacks the strength to
elbow its way out of the crowd.&O;

<SUMMARY>GRiD Systems Corp's GRiD 386is-33 microcomputer is a well-made but
high-priced machine with limited expansion capability.&P;  The $8,449
test configuration includes 4Mbytes of RAM, 32Kbytes of cache RAM,
a 1.44Mbyte floppy drive, a 150Mbyte hard disk and a VGA board and
monitor.&P;  The GRiD employs an active backplane design with a
dedicated slot for the microprocessor and cache and two slots that
can hold proprietary 32-bit memory boards or 16-bit option boards.&O;
The small-footprint chassis holds two 3.5-inch drive bays and two
half-height, 5.25-inch drive bays.&P;  The FCC Class B-certified case
is sturdy, and the keyboard's action and feedback are good.&P;  GRiD
designed the system for Tandy, so Tandy peripherals will operate
with the system.&P;  The GRiD is only sold direct and through
value-added resellers, so lower prices may be obtained.&M;

GRiD Systems Corp. GRiD 386is-33 According to GRiD Systems Corp., its
engineers designed the GRid 386is-33 for manufacture by its parent company,
Tandy.&P;  If so, GRiD's design effort might have begun and ended with a look at
a Tandy 386-based PC in a Radio Shack catalog, since the resemblance between
the machines stops only at their name tags.&M;

While the GRiD 386is-33 offers some enhancements over its all-Tandy
inspiration--a great keyboard and an almost-unlimited variety of drive
options--it is very much a Tandy computer.&P;  That means good quality at a
relatively steep price.&P;  The $5,999 base system includes 4MB RAM, a 1.44MB
floppy disk drive, and a VGA adapter.&P;  Add an Imprimis 150MB ESDI hard disk
($1,800), a Tandy VGM-200 VGA monitor ($500), and DOS 4.01 ($150) to extend
the 386is-33 to the standard PC Magazine test configuration, and the list
price rockets up to $8,449.&P;  (For other monitor options, check with your
local Radio Shack store, which should sell the same monitors that are
marketed by GRiD for the 386is-33.)&M;

A small-footprint design, the GRiD 386is-33 measures a trim 6.5 by 17 by 15
inches (HWD) by shaving off a couple of expansion slots and a drive bay.&P;  It
offers two side-by-side 3.5-inch bays and two stacked half-height 5.25-2nch
bays that will also accommodate a full-height device.&P;  Proprietary plastic
mounting rails for both 5.25-inch bays are already installed.&M;

The seven retaining brackets on the rear panel of the GRiD 386is-33 belie the
system's real expansion capacity.&P;  Because it uses a backplane design, three
expansion slots are filled with the basic necessities of computing.&M;

A microprocessor-and-cache card resides in a proprietary slot,and two
outboard slots do double-duty for memory and options.&P;  Each of the two has a
proprietary 32-bit connector for system RAM boards (one of whixh was filled
in our review system).&P;  The remaining four slots accommodate full-length,
full-height 16-bit ISA expansion boards.&P;  In our evaluation system, one of
them was filled with an Adaptec ESDI hard disk controller card although an
IDE connector is provided on the system board.&P;  Thus, systems that use IDE
drives will have one more full-lenth slot free than we did.&M;

With memory installed, each short slot can hold an AT expansion board up to
7.25 inches long.&P;  One of these in our review system was filled with a Tandy
VGA-16 display adapter.&P;  Each six-inch memory board has eight SIMM sockets,
giving the GRiD 386is-33 machine total capacity of 16MB of 80-ns.&P;  page-mode
memory that's interleaved in even increments of 8MB.&M;

The microprocessor board is home for the system's 33-MHz 80386
microprocessor, a socket for an optional 80387 coprocessor, and an Intel
82385 cache controller.&P;  Sixteen sockets hold the 32K of nonexpandable 20-ns.&O;
cache memory.&P;  Even with the cache, the 386is-33 scored near the bottom of
the machines in its class.&M;

The backplane of the GRiD 386is-33 is active.&P;  That is, the Tandy system
board provides all the support functions to operate the computer except for
memory and microprocessor.&P;  Included in its circuitry are the floppy disk
drive controller, which is capable of handling two disk drives; serial,
parallel, and PS/2-style mouse ports (one each); clock and CMOS; and the IDE
connector.&P;  The backplane fills nearly the entire bottom of the computer, cut
away only under the drive bays.&M;

Controls on the front of the GRiD 386is-33 case are minimal.&P;  The on/off
switch at the upper right edge of the front panel connects to the 200-watt
Tandy power supply at the right rear corner of the chassis with a long
plastic rod.&P;  At the left on the front panel is a reset switch and a
mechanical lock for the case.&P;  Password protection for the keyboard is
provided as part of the Phoenix BIOS.&M;

The system unit itself is sturdily made with steel that's thick for the size
of the chassis.&P;  Interior wiring is kept to a minimum and is well-controlled.&M;

Screening has been added in a couple of places to cut emissions down to the
FCC Class B level.&P;  Although the ESDI cable looks odd in that it sqeezes
between some of this screen and the top of the microprocessor board, this
scheme is the only way to achieve a good interference-reducing connection
between the top of the case and the bottom.&M;

The GRid 101-key keyboard deserves special note for its precise action and
exacting tactile and gentle audible feedback.&M;

There's little wrong with the GRiD 386is-33 other than its price.&P;  But since
the 386is-33 is sold only by the GRiD direct sales force and through VARs,
you stand a good chance of negotiating a more reasonable price.&O;

160Mbyte hard disk and a Super VGA board and monitor.&P;  Intel Corp
builds the system, which includes ten expansion slots.&P;  Two are
Intel 32-bit bus slots, seven are standard Industry Standard
Architecture (ISA) bus slots and one is an 8-bit slot.&P;  The
motherboard can hold 8Mbytes of RAM, and a metal channel directs
cooling air over the RAM chips.&P;  The case holds four half-height,
5.25-inch drive bays, two full-height bays and a 302-watt power
supply.&P;  The FCC Class B-rated case is extremely strong, and
secondary metal coverings shield the drive bays and expansion
boards.&P;  The system's performance is average, but the system would
make a good file server or workstation.&M;

Hertz Computer Corp. Hertz 386/33i Saying that Hertz Computer Corp.hs 386/33i
is built like a tank is more truth than simile.&P;  This file server
extrordinaire is reinforced with layers of heavy armor plating and has more
expansion options than most people might normally need.&M;

For $5,095, you can buy the Hertz 386/33i in its basic configuration, which
includes 4MB RAM, a 64K processor RAM cache, either a 1.2MB or 1.44MB floppy
disk drive, either DOS 3.3 or 4.01, and a controller but no hard disk, video
adapter, or monitor.&P;  Add a second floppy disk drive, a Micropolis 160MB ESDI
hard disk, a Trident VGA adapter, and a Sony CPD-1304 monitor, all of which
came with our evaluation system, and the price jumps to $7,595, makig the
package expensive but competitive with major-brand PCs and ones of equal
quality.&M;

This 24.5- by 6.8- by 26.5-inch (HWD) tower system is, in fact, made by a
major brand: Intel Corp. Hertz was Intel's first OEM vendor for the company's
386-based systemboards in 1986,and the 386/33i continues that tradition.&M;

Intel builds--or perhaps overbuilds--sturdy computers.&P;  The armor on the
386/33i is couble-thick.&P;  After you remove the heavy steel decorative case
sheath, you still must pry off additional sheet metal coverign the drive bays
and expansion slots to get at the system's innards.&P;  Underneath is plenty of
room for expansion, including four half-height 5.25-inch drive bays, two
full-height bays, and ten (yes, ten) expansion slots.&M;

The slots themselves are vertical; expansion boards hang down from them like
sleeping bats.&P;  Two slots use Intel's 32-bit expansion bus and seven the
standard 16-bit ISA bus; the last is an 8-bit slot designed for an expansion
board with a drooping skirt.&P;  In all working models, two of the 16-bit slots
are filled--one with a Trident VGA adapter and the other an Ultrastor Ultra
12(F) combined ESDI hard/floppy disk controller.&M;

Additional sheet metal is used to form a cooling channel over the 386/33i's
memory: eight SIMM Sockets for 1MB modules (although 256K modules will work,
Hertz doesn't ofer them), and eight 4-by-64K, 25-ns.&P;  SRAM chips that serve
as a cache.&M;

The Intel motherboard does not use an Intel 82385 cache controller but
instead opts for a proprietary design, which is said to offer better
performance.&P;  Even so, the Hertz 386/33i scored only in the middle of the
spectrum of machines reviewed here.&M;

You'll have to remove the wind-tunnel cover to access the 33-MHz 80386
microprocessor and coprocessor socket, which will accommodate either an 80387
or Weitek 3167 operating at 33-MHz.&P;  The Phoenix BIOS includes setup
procedures in its code, and supports system and video BIOS shadowing.&M;

A large six-inch fan blows air through the cooling channel and out of the
rear bottom of the chassis.&P;  A 302-watt power supply is tucked in the bottom
front corner of the chassis.&P;  Although the power supply has only four DC
connectors, the chassis has a strip of additional power connectors into which
you can plug cables.&P;  Battery power is packaged along with CMOS memory and
the system clock in a Dallas module.&M;

The power cord and output jack for monitor power are situated at the very
bottom of the back of the case, the best possible location.&P;  Expansion board
connections run through a tunnel at the top of the case,hidden by a pivoting
plastic trap door, and out an opening in the rear.&M;

The front control panel offers a minimum of controls--a keyboard lock, reset
switch, and two indicators for power and drive activity.&P;  The power swith is
at foot level in front of the chassis.&P;  Although there's no turbo switch, you
can slow the 386/33i down to 8-MHz by pressing a three-kay combination on the
keyboard.&M;

The Hertz 101-key keyboard uses Cherry switch mechanisms.&P;  It's a lightweight
product with a gentle snap action.&P;  However, keys must be fully released
before they will snap a second time.&M;

The Class B-certified 386/33i is protected by a one-year warranty that
provides for on-site service anywhere in the world by Intel.&P;  But the
well-armored Hertz 386/33i is unlikely to need that, even in a network war
zone.&O;

Hyundai Electronics America Hyundai Super-386T Anyone who is familiar with
the Korean industry giant Hyundai would expect a computer bearing that label
to use exclusively imported components.&P;  Not the Super-386T.&P;  This compact
powerhouse bears a Made-in-USA label and uses American parts, from its system
board to its hard disk drive.&P;  That was a good decision: the Super-386T came
in second in overall performance on PC Labs' benchmark tests.&M;

The Super-386T also bears an American sticker price rather than that of a
budget import.&P;  With 4MB RAM, a 64K processor RAM cache, a 200MB IDE hard
disk, one 1.2MB floppy disk drive, and a Super VGA video display, the system
costs $7,840; with 4MB RAM, a 64K processor RAM cache, a 40MB hard disk, one
1.2MB floppy disk drive, a VGA adapter but not monitor, the system costs
$5,595.&M;

As stylish as it is speedy, the Super-386T comes in a 6.3- by 16- by
16.5-inch (HWD) case with smoothly rounded edges on its front panel.&O;
Everything you need--on/off, reset, turbo, and keyboard-lock switches as well
as colorful LED indicatiors for power, disk activity, and turbo operation--is
up front where it counts.&P;  The chassis is as sturdy as it is attractive.&P;  The
unpainted heavy-weight stamped steel doesn't give in the least even when
leaned upon heavily.&M;

The small-footprint case allows for about all the expansion a desktop
computer might need.&P;  The unit has two 5.25-inch horizontal half-height drive
bays with front-panel access and two vertical 3.5-inch bays, one with
front-panel access and the other hidden deeply inside.&M;

Seven expansion slots line the left side of the case: one 8-bit, one 32-bit,
and the rest 16-bit ISAs.&P;  Two of the 16-bit slots are filled in any working
system, one with an ATIVGA Wonder display adapter, the other with a Silicon
Valley Computers combined IDE host adapter and floppy disk controller.&M;

The Super-386T's motherboard itself is manufactured by the Motherboard
Factory.&P;  It uses an AMI BIOS, with its setup function built into the BIOS.&O;
Most of the circuitry is made from discrete chips, with only one large ASIC
from VLSI Corp.&P;  The three standard ports--two serial (both with 9-pin
connectors) and one parallel-all originate in systm board circuitry.&M;

The heart of the system board is, of course, a 33-MHz Intel 80386
microprocessors.&P;  A socket awaits the addition of an Intel 80387 or Weitek
3167 coprocessor, either of which must be rated at 33-MHz.&P;  Eight sockets are
provided for page-mode SIMMs with either 256K or IMB capacity and an 80-ns.&O;
speed rating.&P;  Complementing the computer's main memory is 64K of 20-ns.&O;
SRAM cache control, which uses discrete circuitry.&P;  Neither system nor video
BIOS shadowing is supported.&M;

Those who want to add a numeric coprocessor themselves will have an easy
time, because the socket is easily accessed once the system is open.&P;  Adding
memory is a different story.&P;  The SIMM sockets are hidden under the power
supply, which you must remove (or remove the system board) in order to get at
them.&M;

The Super-386T's hard disk, a Conner 200MB 3.5-inch unit, sits in an internal
bay next to the power supply.&P;  Its formated capacity is 203MB.&P;  Although you
must remove both 3.5-inch bays to add (or subtract) a drive unit, the
operation is easy, involving the removal of only two screws.&M;

The Hyundai's 200-watt power supply is electrically linked to the on/off
switch on the front panel.&P;  The switch is enclosed in a metal box, which
keeps it safe when the system unit is opened.&M;

Although the disk drive ribbon cables are snarled in the case, the rest of
the internal layout is very clean, and power supply wires are neatly bundled.&O;
Four power connectors for drives are provided, two of which are used.&M;

Hyundai supplies an Oki Japan 101-key keyboard, which has a quiet click and
good tactile feedback.&P;  Also standard with the FCC Class B-rated Super-386T
is an 18-month parts-and-labor warranty.&P;  You'll have to return the system to
your dealer if it needs service.&M;

As the Super-386T proves, Hyundai isn't only a manufacturer of budget-priced
imports.&P;  Its name should also be associated with a quality American-made
computer--albeit one that doesn't cost all that much less than a subcompact
car.&O;

Insight Distribution Network Inc. Insight 386-33 Aiming high, Insight
Distribution Network Inc. targets systems from leading mail-order vendors as
the competition it hopes its new Insight 386-33 will crush.&P;  The machine has
the potential.&P;  It's got the power, is backed by good service, and has an
appealing list price.&P;  But its design and overall quality fall short of the
mark.&M;

The Insight system taht comes closest to the others reviewed in this roundup
includes a 200MB Conner hard disk, one 1.2MB or one 1.44MB floppy disk drive,
a Super VGA adapter and display, a 64K processor RAM cache, either DOS 3.3 or
4.01, and 4MB of RAM, and costs $3,695.&P;  (Recently, Insight upped the
standard memory of the 386-33 to 8MB, which raises the system cost by $200.)&O;
The least expensive system, with a 40MB IDE hard disk, one floppy disk drive,
64K processor RAM cache, and Hercules video system, costs $2,739 with 8MB
RAM.&M;

Instead of using custom-designed cases and system boards like its direct-mail
rivals, Insight has assembled its system from generic components and backed
their workmanship with a one-year parts-and-lavor warranty.&P;  The centerpiece
of the Insight 386-33 is its Armas motherboard, which is based primarily on a
Chips and Technologies chip set and an AMI BIOS.&P;  The 33-MHz 80386 can be
augmented by either an Intel 80387 or Weitek 3167 math coprocessor operating
at 25 MHz or 33 MHz.&P;  On PC Labs' benchmark tests the board's 64K cache and
interleaved page memory earned the Insight 386-33 a performance score in the
upper third of the machines we tested and within a fraction of the leaders.&O;
Both video and system BIOS shadowing are supported.&M;

Perhaps the most notable detail of teh Armas motherboard is its memory
accommodations: 12 SIMM sockets and 36 DIP sockets.&P;  In the standard 8MB
configuration, eight of the SIMM sockets are filled with 80-ns.&P;  1MB modules;
the remaining sockets and the DIPs (armed with 1Mb chips) can extend the
Insight's memory to 16MB.&P;  The Armas motherboard makes no provision for
high-speed add-in memory board.&M;

Of the eight ISA slots housed in the Insight's tower-style case, two are used
by standard equipment: a Chicony host adapter for IDE hard disks, which also
supplies the system's one parallel and two serial ports; and an ATI VGA
Wonder, which offers video output to match any standard from Hercules to
Super VGA.&P;  These two 16-bit boards leave four 16-and two 8-bit slotsfree for
future expansion.&P;  The bus operates at either 8 MHz or 16 Hz.&M;

The big Insight case, which measures 24 by 7.5 by 19 (HWD) inches, doesn't
provide much room for drive expansion.&P;  In our evaluation system, the two
3.5-inch bays contained a TEAC floppy disk drive and a 200mb Conner hard
disk, which formats to 204MB.&P;  One of the two half-height 5.25-inch bays
housed a Toshiba floppy disk drive.&P;  Only an internal full-height and a
half-height 5.25-inch bay were vacant.&P;  The five connectors of the 250-watt
KPI power supply are exactly what's needed to accommodate additional drives.&M;

Inside, the Insight 386-33 is neat though not a paragon of design elegance.&O;
Outside, however, the system is attractive, with its turbo and reset buttons
molded into the control panel.&P;  A two-digit LED display indicates whether the
Insight is operating at 33 MHz or its slower 8 MHz rate.&P;  The front panel
keyswitch locks the keyboard but does not prevent access to the inside of the
case.&M;

Insight provides adequate peripherals for the 386-33, among them a Chicony
soft-click 101-key keyboard with 12 top-row function keys and a TVM Supersync
3A Super VGA monitor.&P;  The one-year of on-site servie through TRW should
allay whatever fears you might have about the system or these accessories.&M;

Price is the prime reason for choosing the Insight.&P;  Although its frive
accommodations and 16MB maximum memory may prove limited in the future, the
386-33 will likely provide a lot of assistance until then.&O;

Master Computer Inc. Cascade 386/33 Master Computer's Cascade 386/33 comes in
a so-so, mini-tower chassis, runs at respectable speeds, and sells at a
lower-to-middle-range prices.&P;  Overall, however, the Cascade 386/33 stops
short of distinguishing itself--either for its vices or virtues.&M;

Prices for the Cascade 386/33 start at $2,795, which buys you 4MB RAM, a 64K
static RAM cache, one 1.2MB 5.25-inch and one 1.44MB 3.5-inch floppy disk
drive, and DOS 3.3 or 4.01.&P;  Our evaluation unit came with a 150MB hard disk
and color Super VGA display, bringing the list price to $4,495.&M;

The machine's respectable collection of name-brand components begins with a
Micronics motherboard.&P;  Unlike the Micronics board used in several other of
the machines reviewed here, this version untilizes discrete logic instead of
a single chip set.&P;  The board employs Phoenix BIOS and provides two 8-bit
slots, five 16-bit slots, and one proprietary, 32-bit slot.&M;

One of the few recognizable chips on the motherboard is the Intel 82385 cache
controller, which accommodates either 32K or 64K of static RAM and allows
either direct map or two-way set associative operation.&P;  Our unit came fully
configured with 64K of 25-nanosecond static RAM and was set to operate with
the two-way set-associate cache.&M;

The motherboard relegates all system RAM to one proprietary, 32-bit board,
populated to half its capacity in our unit with 4MB of 9-by-1MB, 80-ns.&O;
SIMMs.&P;  Two 40-pin connectors allow installation of an optional daughtercard,
which brings the total 32-bit memory capacity to 16MB.&M;

Other motherboard features include a single 121-pin PGA socket, which
accommodates either an Intel 80387 or Weitek 3167 math coprocessor.&P;  The
motherboard supports both system and video BIOS shadowing and can run the I/O
bus at 8.25 MHz or 11 MHz.&M;

The hard disk in our evaluation unit was the NEC LR 56913, a 16-millisecond
ESDI drive with a formatted capacity of 157MB.&P;  A Western digital WD1007-SE2
controller with an 8K buffer played host to the hard disk and Chinon floppy
disk drives.&M;

The Super VGA video subsystem comprised a 16-bit ATI VGA Wonder with 512K RAM
and an analog-only Gold-Star 1460 Pluus monitor.&P;  As a team, the two are
capable of a top resolution of 800-by-600 with 16 colors.&P;  The adapter can
drive an 8514/A or high-resolution multiscanning monitor at a resolution of
1,024-by-768 interlaced with four colors.&M;

Master Computer ships the Cascade 386 with a 101-key Key Tronic keyboard.&O;
The Key Tronic feels notably solid and substantial, but buyers who like a
little click in their key action are in a for a bit of a disappointment.&M;

The mini-tower chassis, which measures 18.6 by 6.8 by 15.8 (HWD) inches,
boasts a few nice features but suffers from a notable drawback or two.&P;  The
niceties include plenty of back-panel port cutouts, a thin but effective
tower stand, and a full assortment of front-panel features: reset and turbo
buttons, keyboard lock, a two-digit LED turbo indicator, and front-panel
access to three half-height drives and two micro-height, 3.5-inch drives.&O;
The drive carriage makes room for three additional micro-height 3.5-inch
drives behind the front panel.&M;

The bad news comes to light the first timme you need to poke around inside
the machine.&P;  The chassis frame seems sturdy enough, if somewhat roughly
finished, but putting the over and coated-plastic front panel back on can
test one's patience and upper-body strength--the fit is a bit too snug.&P;  When
we had managed at last to reassemble the Cascade 386/33, we noticed that the
front-panel power buttom had receded from its cut-out at some point during
the operation.&M;

Master Computer has made at least some attempt to provide real documentation
with this machine, but the resulting 34-page manual is exceptional only in
its poor use of language, lack of illustrations, and dearth of useful
information.&P;  Neither novice nor power user will glean much from these pages.&O;
Fortunately, Master also provides vendors' manuals for major components,
including the Micronics motherboard.&M;

The Cascade 386/33 comes with a one-year, parts-and-labor warranty.&P;  Master
reports that it sells its machines both through dealers and via mail order.&O;
Mail-order buyers can receive service via phone with 24-hour parts shipping
or by shipping the machine back to Master.&P;  Those who buy from a dealer must
return the machine to the dealer for service.&M;

Master Computer's 33-MHz entry performs competently, offers a nice selection
of features, and comes with well-known, capable components.&P;  Overall,
however, Master provides no compelling reason for buyers to opt for the
Cascade 386/33.&P;  Other machines reviewed in this roundup offer comparable
features, quality, and performance at a lower price.&O;

<SUMMARY>Matrix Digital Products Inc.'s Matrix 386/33 microcomputer lacks
polish and documentation, but its performance is respectable, its
construction is solid, and its price is acceptable.&P;  The $4,880
test configuration includes 4Mbytes of RAM, 64Kbytes of cache
SRAM, a 159Mbyte hard drive, a 1.2Mbyte floppy drive and a Super
VGA board and monitor.&P;  The Micronics motherboard is neatly
arranged and can hold a maximum of 4Mbytes of RAM.&P;  Matrix
includes a 32-bit memory card that will accept up to 16Mbytes of
RAM.&P;  The system will accept a maximum of 16Mbytes of RAM, so the
motherboard or the memory card's bank 0 must be left empty.&P;  The
motherboard has seven 16-bit slots but no 8-bit slots.&P;  The FCC
Class A-rated case holds two full-height drive bays, two
half-height, 5.25-inch bays and two 3.5-inch bays.&P;  The disk
controller's 8Kbyte buffer should be fully populated to 32Kbytes
to improve disk performance.&M;

Matrix Digital Products Inc. Matrix 386/33 The Matrix 386/33 lacks any
semblance of custom documentation, carries only FCC Class A certification,
and sells at a price a good bit above that of some of its more-aggressive
competitors.&P;  For those in the market for a low-cost network file server,
however, this machine begins to look like a bargain, thanks in large part to
its roomy tower chassis.&M;

In its basic configuration, the Matrix 386/33 lists at $2,435 and comes with
4MB RAM, a 32K processor RAM cache, one 1.2MB 5.25-inch floppy disk drive, a
14-inch monographics monitor.&P;  QAPlus diagnostics, and DOS 3.3 or 4.01.&P;  Our
evaluation unit, which came with a 64K cache, 159MB hard disk, color Super
VGA display, and Disk Manager 4.0, carried a list price of $4,880.&P;  All
configurations include one parallel, one game, and two serial ports.&M;

Though lacking the reassuring heft and internal finish you'd generally get
with a more expensive machine, the tower chassis of the Matrix 386/33 fits
together well and seems solidly built.&P;  The chassis, which measures 23.8 by 7
by 19.1 (HWD) inches, provides room for a respectable number of storage
devices.&P;  Our evaluation unit came with a full-height, 159MB ESDI drive--a
Seagate ST 4182E--tucked into one of two hidden, full-height bays.&P;  The
chassis provides front-panel access to an additional four drive bays--two
standard-height, 3.5-inch bays and two half-height, 5.25-inch.&P;  Other chassis
features include a two-digit system speed indicator on the front panel and
two pairs of pivoting feet on the bottom panel, which swing out to provide
additional stability.&M;

The Micronics motherboard mounted at the lower end of the chassis deserves
special mention.&P;  You probably won't look at the board often, but you'll feel
good about the machine when you do.&P;  Micronics built the board around its own
four-chip chip set, which lies in a grid arrangement next to the 33-MHz 386
chip and Intel 82385 cache controller.&P;  The static-RAM chips line up in two
columns to the right, near the 121-pin math coprocessor socket and Phoenix
BIOS chips, and four SIMM connectors line up to the left.&P;  An ugly
motherboard might work just as well, but this clean, integrated design should
make system upgrades and maintenance somehwat quicker and easier.&M;

Our evaluation unit came fully endowed with eight 25-ns., 8-by-8K chips,
providing the 64K static RAM necessary to allow two-way associative cache
operation.&P;  With only 22K installed, the motherboard must be configured to
run with a direct-mapped cache.&M;

Our unit also provided not only the maximum of 4MB of 80-nanosecond
motherboard SIMMs but also an unpopulated 32-bit memory card.&P;  The card,
which occupies the board's one 32-bit expansion slot, will accommodate a
maximum of 16MB RAM via four banks of four SIMM connectors.&P;  Lest youu
conclude that 4MB plus 16MB equals 20MB, however, beware: either the
motherboard SIMM connectors or bank 0 on the memory card must be left vacant,
which results in a total 32-bit system RAM capacity of 16MB.&M;

The 121-pin PGA socket accommodates either an Intel 80387 or Weitek 3167 math
coprocessor, and the motherboard supports both BIOS and video shadowing.&P;  Bus
speed can be set through hardware at 8.25 MHz, 11 MHz, or 16.5 MHz.&M;

Micronics dispensed with the traditional 8-bit slot or two when designing
this motherboard, providing instead seven 16-bit slots in addition to the
high-speed memory slot.&P;  Three of the seven in our unit were occupied, one by
the 8-bit I/O controller, another by the Data Technology Corp. (DTC) ESDI
disk controller, and the third by a 16-bit Super VGA adapter.&M;

The I/O controller provides a parallel port and 9-pin video port via its slot
bracket.&P;  Two additional ports, a game port and 25-pin serial port, extend
via cable to the chassis' back-panel port cutouts.&M;

The DTC 6280-15T disk controller, which accepts a maximum track buffer of
32K, came with an 8K buffer and played host to the 1.2MB Epson floppy drive
and 16.5-ms.&P;  Seagate ESDI hard drive.&M;

The 16-bit video controller, fully loaded with 512K RAM, bears no
identification but uses the Paradise/Western Digital chip set and is an OEM
version of a Paradise board.&P;  As a team, the Paradise board and our machine's
14-inch monitor--a Relisys RE5155 TTL/analog multiscanning monitor--are
capable of a maximum resolution of 800 by 600 with 16 simultaneous colors.&M;

Matrix Digital's warranty covers parts and labor for the Matrix 386/33 for
one year through its dealers.&P;  The company reports that it will begin
providing four months of free on-site service through Nationwide Warranty
Corp. in January of 1991.&P;  System documentation is limited to the DOS manuals
and vendors' component manuals.&M;

The Matrix 386/33 performed respectably on all of the PC Labs benchmark
tests, but its hard disk performance fell toward the slow end of the pack.&O;
If you buy this machine, you'll probably want to upgrade the disk controller
to its full 32K RAM track buffer.&M;

All in all, the Matrix 386/33 is nothing to rave over, but it does offer
respectable performance, relatively solid construction, and name-brand
components.&P;  If you're looking for a low-cost network file server and are
willing to forgo documentation and Class B certification, this machine might
be worth a closer look.&O;

<SUMMARY>Memorex Telex Corp's 7075 microcomputer is a slightly modified AST
Premium 386/33 that offers high quality at a high price.&P;  The
$11,619 test configuration includes 4Mbytes of RAM, a 32Kbyte RAM
cache, a 1.44Mbyte floppy drive, a 16-millisecond (ms), 160Mbyte
hard drive and a Super VGA board and monitor.&P;  AST's system board
has three 32-bit slots that are used for the processor board and
two 16Mbyte memory boards.&P;  The processor board can hold 4Mbytes
of RAM to hold the system maximum of 36Mbytes.&P;  The FCC Class
B-rated chassis holds one full-height and three half-height drive
bays.&P;  Memorex Telex includes AST's well-written users manual.&O;
The parts-and-labor warranty provides 90 days of on-site service
or one year of carry-in service.&P;  The on-site service can be
extended to one year for $35.&P;  The system is slow, but users who
want Memorex Telex's service and support may overlook its price
and performance.&M;

Memorex Telex 7075 Long a seller of 3270 terminals and AS/ peripherals,
Memorex Telex has expanded its line of offerings to include intelligent
workstations--a.k.a.&P;  PCs.&P;  In this case, the intelligent workstation, the
Memorex Telex 7075, is a repackaged and slightly altered AST Premium 386/33
(see "22 Powerhouse PCs Top Off at 33 MHz," October 31, 1989).&M;

In keeping with its major-league corporate image, Memorex Telex lists the
7075 at prices most of us would rather not pay.&P;  The base system is
configured with 4MB RAM, a 32K processor RAM cache, and one 1.44MB 3.5-inch
floppy disk drive, and carries a list price of $7,300.&P;  Additionally equipped
with a 160MB ESDI hard drive, a Super VGA display, and DOS 4.01 to meet our
standard configuration for this article, the system costs $11,619.&P;  Our
evaluation unit also came with a 33-MHz 80387 math coprocessor, which brings
things up to $13,219.&M;

Of course, as with IBM, Compaq, and other companies that go the
high-list-price route, Memorex Telex might be willing to lower the selling
price somewhat.&P;  A Memorex Telex representative declined to say that the
company offers discounts but did say that selling prices were competitive.&O;
In addition, the company stresses its strong customer support service and
total-solution, direct-sales approach.&M;

Aside from differences in chassis color and markings, the Memorex Telex 7075
looks identical to the AST machine, and the FCC Class B certification
statement on the back panel of the system even bears the AST Premium 386/33
name.&P;  This should in no way be construed as a complaint.&P;  The desktop
chassis is an excellent one, well-built, well-fitted, and offering abundant
features, including a flush-mounted front-panel reset button and front-panel
access to three half-height drives.&P;  Two additional half-height drives lie
hidden behind the front panel.&P;  The back panel includes a chassis lock and
cutouts for the standard-equipment parallel port and two serial ports, which
derive from the system board.&M;

Internally, the 7075 uses the same AST system and processor boards as the
Premium 386/33.&P;  The system board provides one 8-bit slot, three 16-bit
slots, and three 32-bit slots.&P;  The processor board installs into one of the
32-bit slots and provides the 386 processor, sockets for both the Intel 80387
and Weitek 3167 math coprocessors, 4MB of 80-nanosecond memory, an Intel
82385 cache controller, and 32K of 25-ns.&P;  cache memory.&P;  The Award-based AST
BIOS supports video and system BIOS shadowing and offers three types of
password protection.&P;  It also provides an extensive CMOS setup program, which
allows a great deal of flexibility in specifying system operation and
includes a few options that can be tailored to network applications.&M;

In what has to be one of this machine's most unusual features, the two
additional 32-bit slots can each accommodate an extra 16MB of high-speed RAM
via AST add-in cards, which will provide users with an upper limit of 36MB of
high-speed, 32-bit RAM.&M;

Of the seven system board slots, one of the 16-bit slots and two of the
32-bit slots use AST's SMARTslot extensions.&P;  In theory, the SMARTslot bus
was to allow AST machines to make use of bus-mastering adapters, but the
adapters never materialized, in part because AST joined the rest of the "gang
of nine" in creating and endorsing the EISA 32-bit bus architecture.&P;  While
the SMARTslot extensions, which are simply remnants of pre-EISA days, won't
do anything for you, they won't get in the way, either.&M;

In one of its departures from the AST machines PC Magazine has reviewed in
the past, the 7075 uses a 16-bit Headland Technology Super VGA adapter and
Tatung VGA monitor rather than AST video components.&P;  The hard disk subsystem
in our evaluation unit comprised a Western Digital WD1007V-SE2 ESDI
controller and Seagate/Imprimis 94246 hard disk, which is rated at 16-ms.&O;
and formats to a capacity of 160MB.&P;  Instead of using the floppy controller
integrated into the motherboard, the 7075 connects its TEAC floppy disk drive
to the floppy interface integrated into the Western Digital controller.&M;

The 7075's keyboard, manufactured by NMB Electronics, rates no less than
wonderful.&P;  This large, 101-style keyboard feels substantial and provides a
clicky key action every IBM keyboard fan should appreciate.&M;

Memorex Telex ships the 7075 with AST's excellent 150-page user's manual,
albeit relabelled with the Memorex Telex name.&P;  Memorex Telex gives buyers
two free options for the standard warranty: the company will cover parts and
labor for one year under a carry-in arrangement or for 90 days with on-site
service.&P;  For the paltry sum of $35, you can upgrade service to one full year
of on-site service.&P;  With any of these arrangements, service is performed by
the company's national network of 240 service centers.&M;

The 7075 performed about as fast as its AST counterpart on the PC Labs
processor and memory benchmark tests, but, like the AST, rates among the
slowest 33-MHz machines you'll find in these types of tasks.&P;  This
disappointing speed can probably be attributed to the machine's use of the
Intel cache controller in its direct-map mode and the straight row/column
system memory arrangement.&P;  The 7075 turned in respectable results on disk
and video tests, however, and actually showed some better speeds than the AST
Premium system that was reviewed previously.&M;

Despite its mediocre performance and substantial list price, the 7075 should
be an attractive machine for a number of buyers, and particularly for those
working in 3270 and AS/400 environments.&P;  If you need the support and service
a company like Memorex Telex can provide and want a solid, well-built
machine, the Memorex Telex 7075 may be the perfect computer for you.&O;

<SUMMARY>Micro Telesis Inc's MT 386DX microcomputer offers respectable

a 64Kbyte SRAM cache, 1.2Mbyte and 1.44Mbyte floppy drives, a
150Mbyte hard disk and a Super VGA board and monitor.&P;  The SIC Inc
motherboard holds 16Mbytes of RAM, but the board's alternate
processor speed is 16 MHz, which is probably too fast for some
software.&P;  The RAM cache can be expanded to 256Kbytes.&P;  The disk

MT 386DX Micro Telesis Inc. sells its 33-MHz MT 386DX at about the price
you'd expect to pay for a comparably equipped 386SX machine, and an
inexpensive one at that.&P;  In its base configuration, the MT 386DX costs
$2,399, including 2MB RAM, 64K processor RAM cache, two floppy drives, a 40MB
hard disk, a VGA display, and either DOS 3.3 or 4.01.&P;  Loaded with 4MB RAM,
64K of processor RAM cache, a 150MB ESDI hard disk, two floppy drives, a
Super VGA display, and DOS 3.3, our evaluation unit carried the incredibly
low list price of $2,899.&P;  Whether or not you should give in to the
temptation of this pricing will depend primarily on how much irritation
you're willing to put up with, and how much of a risk you're willing to take.&M;

The most unusual aspect of the MT 386DX is its mini-tower chassis.&P;  The
front-panel controls of the chassis, which measures 15.7 by 8.6 by 19.5
inches (HWD), lie behind a hinged door, which extends from the bottom of the
top edge of the panel and across most of the width.&P;  On the upside, the door
gives the machine an uncluttered look and protects the reset button from
accidental depression.&P;  A small window in the door allows viewing of the
indicator lights and two-digit speed indicator even when the door is closed.&O;
On the downside, you'll have to open the door to hit the reset or turbo
button or to use either of the floppy drives.&P;  The MT 386DX comes with
Panasonic 1.2MB and 1.44MB Floppy drives and makes room for three additional
half-height drives, all with front-panel access.&M;

Unfortunately, the machine's chassis dealt us an unwanted surprise or two.&O;
After removing the three expansion cards from the machine, we found that
reinstalling the cards was no easy task.&P;  While none of the adapters seemed
to fit just right, the problem was most severe with the 16-bit Paradise OEM
Super VGA adapter.&P;  The top lip of the adapter slot bracket hit against the
top ledge of the slot opening before the card was seated far enough into the
slot.&M;

This improper spacing probably resulted from faulty motherboard mounting.&O;
The board that came in our test unit was supported by the chassis only near
its side edges and bowed inward at the middle.&P;  Whether this sloppy mounting
was the fault of the installation technician or the design of the chassis
itself is difficult to say, but it was more than a trivial problem.&P;  A PC
Labs technician finally got the board into a slot after all of our other
attempts failed.&P;  It shouldn't have required so much effort, however.&M;

An outfit named SIC Inc. manufactures the motherboard that came with our
evaluation unit.&P;  The motherboard makes use of one ASIC chip by VLSI but
depends primarily on discrete logic.&P;  AMI provides the BIOS.&M;

The SIC board departs from the norm for 386 machines in a number of ways.&O;
For instance, the alternate processor speed is 16 MHz rather than the more
typical 8 MHz.&P;  If you occasionally need to slow your system down to
accommodate finicky software, a 16 MHz speed is not likely to do the trick.&M;

In another departure from 386 mother-board design, the SIC board has two
8-bit slots and six 16-bit slots but no 32-bit slots.&P;  While this is somewhat
unusual, it shouldn't be viewed as a problem: the motherboard accommodates a
maximum of 16MB of 80-nanosecond RAM, 12MB via three banks of four SIMM
connectors and an additional 4MB via one bank of 36 DIP sockets.&P;  Four
1MB-by-9 SIMMs provided the 4MB of RAM in our evaluation unit.&M;

The processor RAM cache provided by the motherboard is one of the bright
spots of the MT 386DX.&P;  Controlled by discrete logic, the cache accommodates
a minimum of 64K static-RAM and a maximum of 256K.&P;  The 64K cache in our
evaluation machine comprised ten 4-by-16K chips rated at 20 ns.&M;

Micro Telesis equips the MT 386DX with an Ultrastor U12F/32 controller, which
is another piece of good news.&P;  The Ultrastor, which comes with a 32K track
buffer, boasts a number of unique features, including support of three floppy
drives and the ability to coexist with other ESDI or IDE interface boards.&O;
The half-height ESDI hard disk in our evaluation unit, the NEC LR 56913,
carries a 17-ms.&P;  rating and formats to a maximum capacity of 143MB.&M;

Other components that came with our unit include a Key Tronic 101-key
keyboard of the no-click variety and a 14-inch Tystar Super VGA monitor.&O;
Standard-equipment ports comprise one parallel, one game, and two serial, all
provided by one 8-bit adapter.&M;

Micro Telesis provides only individual component manuals for the MT 386DX.&O;
The company indulges in a bit of obvious one-upmanship with its warranty,
which covers parts and labor for 13 months.&P;  Service is via phone with
overnight parts shipping.&P;  But, if our experience is any indication, demand
on the technical support line may be outstripping manpower.&P;  We had problems
getting correct answers from the technical support staff to fairly simple
questions regarding motherboard components, such as what chip set and cache
controller it used.&P;  This was the result not of a lack of technical knowledge
on the part of the support representatives or of any lack of concern, but of
confusion as to exactly which motherboard was installed in our machine.&M;

The MT 386DX offers a few nice features and sells at an appealing price.&P;  It
also turns in respectable results on PC Labs' benchmark tests, lagging
slightly behind the pack only in video performance.&P;  In all, however, the
difficulties that we experienced with the chassis of this machine and with
the Micro Telesis technical support staff make this system difficult to
recommend.&O;

Mitsuba Corp. Mitsuba 386-33 The Mitsuba 386-33 numbers among the small group
of low-cost machines truly worthy of consideration.&P;  From its Micronics
motherboard to its sturdy desktop chassis, this system offers considerable
quality at a very appealing price.&M;

Equipped with 4MB RAM, 64K of cache memory, one 1.2MB 5.25-inch floppy drive,
a 144MB ESDI hard disk, a Super VGA monitor, and DOS 4.01, the Mitsuba 386-33
carries a list price of $3,895.&P;  (Its base configuration price is $2,465,
including 4MB RAM, 32K processor RAM cache, and one 1.2MB or 1.44MB floppy
disk.)&P;  While this price is a bit steeper than that of several machines
reviewed here, differences such as the Mitsuba's FCC Class B certification
make the machine well worth the extra cost.&P;  In addition, Mitsuba reports
that quantity discounts are available through its dealers.&P;  Mitsuba backs the
machine through its dealers with a one-year, parts-and-labor warranty.&M;

The Mitsuba chassis, which measures 6.5 by 21 by 16.8 (HWD) inches, adheres
to the AT form factor inside and out.&P;  Of course, you do get a few
enhancements, such as updated styling, plenty of rearpanel port cutouts, and
a third half-height drive bay.&P;  The heavy-gauge metal also matches that of
the AT.&M;

The Micronics motherboard employed in the Mitsuba machine is the same capable
board used in the Matrix 386-33, also reviewed in this roundup.&P;  The BIOS is
Phoenix, the chip set is Micronics, and the 121-pin PGA socket accommodates
either an Intel 80387 or Weitek 3167 math coprocessor.&P;  An Intel 82385
provides the smarts for a 32K direct-mapped cache or, with 64K of static RAM
installed, a 32K two-way set associate cache.&P;  Our unit came with a full 64K
of 25-nanosecond static RAM.&M;

The motherboard accepts a maximum of 4MB of 80-ns.&P;  motherboard RAM via four
SIMM connectors.&P;  A Micronics 32-bit card, which was not provided with our
evaluation unit, can hold 16MB, but the system will accommodate no more than
16MB of system RAM.&M;

Of the seven 16-bit slots in our test unit, three were occupied, one by a
Data Technology Corp. (DTC) ESDI disk controller, another by a Paradise OEM
Super VGA adapter, and the third by an 8-bit Mitsuba I/O adapter, which
provides one game port, one parallel port, and two serial ports.&M;

Mitsuba teams the Data Technology DTC6280 controller with a full-height,
23-millisecond Toshiba drive, which formats to a capacity of 144MB.&P;  A
Mitsuba TTL/Analog multi-scanning monitor, the 14-inch 710MH, provides a good
match for the 16-bit video controller.&P;  The duo can handle a top resolution
of 1,024 by 768 with four colors.&P;  The keyboard, made by Honeywell, doesn't
offer much in the way of clicky key action but it does come with a 124-inch
cord.&M;

The machine turned in respectable marks on the PC Labs benchmark tests,
ranking among the fastest of those reviewed here in processor and memory
speed and landing in about the middle of the pack in video performance.&P;  Disk
speed was on the slow side, whether the result of the Toshiba's 23-ms.&O;
average random access time orthe controller's lack of a buffer.&M;

Our only major complaint with this machine is its lack of proper
documentation.&P;  Mitsuba provides a nicely labelled three-ring binder and
jacket with the system, but it fills the binder with the separate component
manuals.&P;  This approach is understandable for vendors who toss machines
together from the hot components of the week, but Mitsuba seems to use a
fairly consistent set of components--Micronics motherboards.&P;  DTC disk
controllers, Toshiba hard drives, Mitsuba monitors.&P;  One hopes the company
will see fit to produce a manual in the near future.&M;

Aside from its lack of custom documentation, the Mitsuba 386-33 compares
favorably to much of the higher-priced competition and blows away just about
everthing in its own price range.&P;  If you're looking for an IBM or a Compaq,
buy an IBM or a Compaq.&P;  If you're looking for a solid, low-cost machine,
give the Mitsuba 386-33 a closer look.&O;

<SUMMARY>MultiMicro Inc's MMI-3364T microcomputer offers decent performance
and comes with one year of on-site service, but the list price is
too high for the machine's mediocre craftsmanship.&P;  The $4,495
test configuration includes 4Mbytes of RAM, a 64Kbyte RAM cache,
1.2Mbyte and 1.44Mbyte floppy drives, a 150Mbyte hard disk, a
Super VGA graphics board and a VGA monitor.&P;  The Technology Power
motherboard does not support system or video BIOS shadowing.&P;  The
motherboard will hold 8Mbytes of RAM, and 8Mbytes of additional
storage can be placed on a 32-bit memory card.&P;  A slot on the test
system was blocked by two ports, which had not been mounted in the
port cutouts.&P;  Power leads and ribbon cable were secured by
masking tape, but MultiMicro says it has stopped using masking
tape inside machines.&P;  The documentation was poorly presented.&O;
MultiMicro provides phone service once the on-site service has
expired.&M;

MultiMicro Inc. MultiMicro MMI-3364T If MultiMicro Inc. were to sell the
MMI-3364T at an outrageously low price, one might be persuaded to overlook
its faults.&P;  As it stands, this machine must be seen for what it is: a
mediocre clone selling at an unspectacular price.&M;

Equipped to meet our standard configuration for this roundup, the MMI-3364T
sells for $4,495.&P;  That price includes 4MB RAM, a 64K processor RAM cache,
1.2MB and 1.44MB floppy disk drives, a 150MB SCSI ahrd disk, a VGA display,
DOS 4.01 and a 101-key Key Tronic keyboard of the no-click variety.&P;  Remove
DOS 4.01 from the picture and substitute a 212MB IDE hard disk for the 150MB
SCSI, and you've got what MultiMicro considers its basic configuration at a
price of $4,295.&P;  All configurations include four I/O ports--one game, one
parallel, and two serial.&M;

Our test unit came in a solid tower chassis with a 250-watt power supply.&O;
Measuring 24.4 by 7.4 by 16.8 (HWD) inches, the chassis provides front-panel
access to as many as six drives and comes with a full assortment of
front-panel controls, including reset and turbo buttons.&M;

Inside the machine, all components but the all-important motherboard bear
names that are at least somewhat familiar.&P;  The SCSI controller, a Future
Domain TMC-885, runs the TEAC floppy drives and 24-millisecond Toshiba MK
156FB-I hard disk, which formats to a capacity of 150MB.&P;  The controller uses
a modified 8-bit interface but requires a 16-bit slot.&M;

The 16-bit Orchid ProDesigner II video board came equipped with 512K RAM for
support of Super VGA modes, but the Tatung 1496G monitor provided with our
evaluation unit is capable only of VGA resolutions.&M;

The motherboard itself, manufactured by a company named Technology Power,
eschews the popular chip sets in favor of discrete logic and makes use of AMI
BIOS.&P;  The board runs the I/O bus at a safe 8 MHz and the processor at either
of two speeds, 10 MHz or 33.5 MHz.&P;  Neither system nor video BIOS shadowing
is supported.&M;

The processor RAM cache, also controlled by discrete logic, employs up to
256K of 20-nanosecond static RAM.&P;  The 64K cache in our test unit used ten
4-by-16K chips.&M;

The system accommodates up to 16MB of 32-bit memory, 8MB via motherboard SIMM
connectors and 8MB on a 32-bit add-on card.&P;  The memory arrangement is
row/column rather than the faster interleaved or interleaved page, but
Technology Power has at least partially made up for this by using 70-ns.&O;
memory.&P;  Our 4MB of motherboard memory came in the form of four 9-by-1Mb
SIMMs.&M;

In addition to the 32-bit proprietary slot, which can also accommodate 8- and
16-bit cards, the Technology Power board provides one 8-bit and six 16-bit
slots.&P;  With the video adapter, disk controller, and 8-bit I/O adapter, our
fully configured machine should still have left us with five free slots.&O;
Instead of utilizing the port cutouts on the back of the chassis, however,
MultiMicro inexplicably mounted two of the ports in a slot-bracket,
effectively reducing the number of open slots to four.&M;

In another odd move, MultiMicro tidied up the inside of the system by
security the power leads into one bundle and folding together excess lengths
of ribbon cable, but all of this was achieved with the use of masking tape.&O;
Aside from being a shoddy solution to a realtively simple problem, this
indiscriminate use of masking tape can cause serious problems.&P;  Give the tape
sufficient time to dry out, and you may well end up with a blocked
power-supply fan.&M;

The MMI-3364T turned in mixed results on PC Labs' benchmark tests.&P;  The
machine edged out in front on the Instruction Mix and Floating Point tests
but lagged toward the rear on Conventional Memory and Disk Throughput tests.&O;
Video performance was respectable despite the machine's lack of BIOS
shadowing.&M;

MultiMicro provides little in the way of documentation with the MMI-3364T.&O;
Our unit came with a three-ring binder bearing the MutliMicro name, but the
binder held only the video utilities diskettes, two slim component manuals,
and a few other small items, all of which amounts to a total thickness of
three-eighths of an inch.&P;  You also get the Orchid manual and motherboard
manual, but the motherboard manual doesn't fit into the binder and the Orchid
manual lacks the three necessary holes.&P;  Of course, you can punch the holes
yourself.&M;

The MMI-3364T comes with one year of free on-site service, provided through
Repair Technologies International.&P;  Once the on-site contract expires,
MultiMicro supports the machine via phone with parts shipping.&M;

The MultiMicro MMI-3364T is not a bad machine, and the free on-site service
is a definite plus.&P;  All things considered, however, the package as a whole
simply doesn't inspire confidence.&P;  MultiMicro reports that it has stopped
using masking tape on the inside of its machines and has begun running the
I/O ports to the backpanel cutouts, but this is the kind of detail you expect
a company to get right the first time.&P;  If you're willing to put up with
mediocrity for the sake of a low price, you'll find less-expensive machines
of comparable quality elsewhere in this roundup.&O;

Novacor Inc. Novas Optimum 386-33 Novacor is ballyhooing its $3,795 Novas
Optimum 386-33 mini-tower as the first 33-MHz 80386-based machine with a
programmable chip set.&P;  What this means is that there are some adjustable
features to the OPTI and Chips and Technologies board and 64K RAM cache
controller.&P;  When considered along with the system's above average
performance, these features look attractive--especially if you hate poking
around inside a PC searching for jumper switches.&P;  Be forewarned, if you
start to poke around inside this PC, you'll find that some of the finer
points of construction have been overlooked.&M;

The programmable chip set, configured to the PC Magazine standard, allows you
to perform system adjustments from the extended CMOS setup, including
altering the number of caching lines from 8 to 16 bits, switching wait states
(0 or 1), activating RAM shadowing (system and video), and changing
interrupts and bus speeds (12 MHz, 10 MHz, or 8 MHz).&P;  The last is
particularly useful if you have an old expansion board you just can't part
with.&P;  For the security conscious, the current AMI BIOS also supports
password protection.&P;  Documentation for these features was slim but the
company claims user-friendly manuals are in the works.&M;

Novacor delivered the Optimum with 4MB of RAM expandable to 8MB on the
motherboard using 80-nanosecond 1MB SIP packaging, which is harder to find at
competitive prices when you want to upgrade.&P;  Moreover, the SIPs on the
motherboard blocked one of the expansion slots, preventing the use of a
full-length card (only a half-length would fit).&P;  This was disappointing, but
not unexpected in a mini-tower design.&P;  Of the eight slots in the review
machine two 16-bit slots were occupied by the video card and hard disk
controller, and the lone 8-bit slot was filled with an I/O board.&P;  A
proprietary 32-bit 8MB add-in memory board is available from Novacor for
$800.&P;  If you still feel bootless you can spring for additional 2MB upgrades
at $200 apiece.&P;  Novacor rates the Optimum's processor for 25-MHz and 33-MHz
operation and its ISA bus at 8 and 16 bits.&M;

Most discomfiting about the Novas Optimum was the shoddy craftsmanship
inside.&P;  Four alkaline batteries for the clock were swathed in plastic and
taped to the side of the power supply, blocking necessary ventilation holes.&O;
A standard lamp cord had been used to connect the power switch to the
200-watt power supply--not a confidence booster.&P;  Furthermore, the machine's
speaker had been jury-rigged to the underside of the case where a hole was
cut for it but no protecting screen was attached.&P;  This meant the speaker's
magnet collected staples and pins off the desktop.&P;  This is a detail that
should be repaired.&P;  Lastly, the front panel reset lamp remains on during
operation.&M;

Given this description, and its FCC Class A certification, you might expect
less than optimum performance from Novacor's machine.&P;  On the contrary:
Though varied, the PC Labs benchmark test results were respectable.&P;  The
ESDI-governed 150MB Maxtor hard disk produced a slow time (61.48 seconds) on
the small records DOS File Access test, but showed far better performance on
the large records (4.85 seconds) and BIOS Disk Seek trials (14.89 seconds).&O;
At 0.25 seconds on the Conventional Memory test, it was topped by only one
other 386 in this review.&P;  Video performance times were equally impressive.&M;

The Optimum's Super VGA card is Novacor's own and uses a Chip and
Technologies 45C controller chip.&P;  The Novas Optimum arrived with a 14-inch
Relisys VGA monitor, so if you want the full potential of the card, add a few
bucks for the monitor upgrade.&P;  Novacor offers a $745 Sony 1304 as its next
step up in Super VGA that costs $400 more than the Relisys model.&P;  Rounding
out the system were a couple of Teac 1.2MB and 1.44MB floppy disk drives,
which together with the full-height hard drive leave one half-height bay
vacant.&M;

With its limitations on possible expansion and its jerry-built appearance,
this mini-tower isn't a reliable LAN server candidate by any means despite a
one-year warranty on parts and labor.&P;  On the other hand, at its below-$4,000
price point, a user who feels at home dealing with the somewhat minor
annoyances of poor construction details may find it worth considering as a
speedy business machine for general applications.&O;

Peregrine Computers Peregrine 386/33SF Flying under the somewhat corny banner
"Computers With Wings," the $3,999 Peregrine 386/33SF configured for this
review is definitely no turkey.&P;  This small-footprint model not only has
attractive plumage, it also comes with enough power to earn its keep in the
office or at home.&P;  Moreover, the 386/33SF will find itself alien in few
environments, especially with its 4MB RAM, 161MB hard disk, Super VGA color
display, and a good assortment of software.&P;  Even at its $2,999 base price,
it comes with 2MB RAM, Microsoft Windows 3.0, DOS 4.01, LIM 4.0, disk caching
software, and a Microsoft Mouse installed as standard features.&M;

To get the full power of a 33-MHz 386 system into a small footprint,
Peregrine saves space inside with a couple of nifty maneuvers.&P;  A compact
200-watt power supply is used, along with an XT-size Atronics motherboard,
and an unusual controller card built by Informtech.&P;  Using IDE controllers, a
single 16-bit card handles not only the floppy and hard drive connections,
but one parallel and two serial ports plus a game port.&P;  There are screw-on
25-pin connector holes in the back of the case but they don't currently
accommodate the 15-pin game port, which takes up an extra slot.&P;  Remove the
game port, and there are six free expansion slots.&M;

Space-saving RAM packaging is laid down in 70-nanosecond 1MB SIMM modules
between the slot connectors, allowing for a total of 8MB on the motherboard,
with an additional 8MB of memory available on a $399 32-bit add-in card.&O;
Included with this is an up-to-date AMI BIOS and keyboard-selectable wait
states of zero or one.&P;  The system board can accommodate an 80287, 80387, or
Weitek 3167 coprocessor.&M;

The Speedstar Super VGA card with a Tseng Labs chip set took flight and
performed extremely well on PC Labs' Direct to Screen and Video BIOS test
routines, putting the Peregrine in the top five in this category.&P;  Processor
speed was above average, certainly enough for most business applications.&M;

Storage devices included with the 386/33SF are two 1.2MB and 1.44MB drives
from TEAC and a 169MB Quantum IDE hard disk, which leaves one half-height bay
vacant.&P;  The Quantum drive DOS File Access and BIOS Seek test times failed to
match the high performance of the video system, capturing one of the slower
large records access times of 5.87 seconds.&P;  Peregrine offers an upgrade to a
200MB IDE hard disk for only $139.&P;  The only cost here is the room lost for
Peregrine's $399 120MB internal tape backup option by migrating to a
full-sized hard disk.&M;

Nevertheless, it's an inescapable rule of small-footprint PCs that you have
to give up some expandability either for extra power or extra space.&P;  The
Peregrine is no exception.&P;  Even though it has the full array of eight slots,
the last two are restricted to three-quarter or half-length cards by the
intrusion of the 3.5-inch floppy disk drive.&M;

However, for those wags who'll complain that the Peregrine is just a bird in
a gilded cage, the company offers a full-sized tower case upgrade for a
paltry $100, which gives you six half-height drive bays and plenty of room.&O;
A standard AT box is available at no extra cost, too.&P;  It's not as pretty as
the small footprint model, but you'll get five half-height bays and
unrestricted internal movement.&M;

Part of the Peregrine 386/33SF package is a reliable Hi-Tek 101 key keyboard.&O;
Here's the rub of a very minor rap against it: There are no finger-position
bumps on the F and J keys.&P;  Otherwise, it's a sturdy and responsive input
device.&P;  Topping off the system's features, we also liked what we saw on the
14-inch MAG Computronic high-resolution Super VGA color monitor.&P;  Its image
quality was good enough to recommend it for user's working with graphics
packages.&M;

The external construction of the 386/33SF elicits confidence, with firm and
tight front-panel power, reset, and turbo switches.&P;  The accompanying user's
manual, although preliminary, is lucid without assuming a great deal of
knowledge on the part of the user.&M;

According to the manufacturer, it's working on Class B FCC certification for
the 386/33SF.&P;  Though the current Class A rating poses the question of a
fly-by-night-operation, Peregrine is far from it.&P;  Our contacts with
technical and support staff confirmed this.&P;  Furthermore, the one-year
parts-and-labor warranty is covered through dealers.&P;  If you can't resolve
your problem by using the toll-free technical support line, Peregrine will
pay full shipping costs.&P;  Important considerations if youre Peregrine ever
breaks a wing.&O;

coprocessors simultaneously and can accept 64Mbytes of RAM, but
its performance is sluggish and its construction seems flimsy.&O;
The $4,265 test configuration includes a 33-MHz 80386
microprocessor, a Cyrix FasMath coprocessor, 4Mbytes of RAM, a
152Mbyte hard disk, 1.2Mbyte and 1.44Mbyte floppy drives and a
Super VGA board and monitor.&P;  The Hauppauge motherboard can hold
4Mbytes of RAM, and a 32-bit card can hold an additional 16Mbytes
of memory.&P;  Precision Systems Group plans to release a
daughterboard to increase system memory to the 64Mbyte limit.&P;  The
processor, video and hard disk benchmark scores were below
average, and the desktop case is only FCC Class A-certified.&P;  The
chassis was strained and warped without the cover on, but the
components have a two-year warranty, and the system has a standard
one-year warranty.&M;

Precision Systems Group Precision 386/33 Any comfort gained at the sight of
sight of fammiliar components under the cover a PC is quickly lost when it's
discovered the parts don't perform well as a whole.&P;  The Precision 386/33 is
a case in point.&P;  This 33-MHz 386 machine, which has strong potential as a
number-crunching, graphics, or design workstation, turned out below-average
scores on PC Labs' comparative testing results.&P;  Although none of its results
landed it in the basement, overall, it hung in the bottom third of the 33-MHz
crowd.&M;

To the Precision's credit, this $4,265 test system includes 4MB RAM, a
Paradise VGA 1024 card, a full-sized 152MB Seagate hard disk, 5.25- and
3.5-inch floppy disk drives from TEAC, a Western Digital integrated disk
controller card, and a Magic I/O card from Everex.&P;  Precision saved a slot
here by taking the second serial port off the Everex card to a cutout in the
back of the case.&P;  The hearty 230-watt power supply and the Seagate hard disk
eat up a considerable amount of space, but this machine can afford it.&P;  With
all that installed, you still have one half-height drive bay, one
8-bit/proprietary 32-bit slot, and four 16-bit slots left open to make your
own arrangements.&M;

On the machine's system board, Precision includes the Cyrix FasMath
coprocessor as part of the Chips and Technologies chip set.&P;  If you choose,
the motherboard can support Intel's 80387 coprocessor and Weitek's 3167
simultaneously, a very attractive arrangement for CAD/CAM use.&M;

Maximum motherboard memory is 4MB of 70-nanosecond four-way interleaved RAM
intended to increase performance with large programs.&P;  According to the
company, if you're particularly hungry for power, the system will handle up
to 64MB of RAM.&P;  Currently, Precision offers a 32-bit 16MB expansion board
that piggybacks additional 1MB DRAM chips to bump the usable memory up to
20MB.&P;  To get the system up to the 64MB stratosphere, Precision will offer a
daughterboard expansion card in the future.&P;  The 64K of 15-nanosecond RAM
caching on the computer is provided by Intel's 82385 controller.&M;

The fact that the Precision's 16-bit ISA bus runs at 8.25 MHz, and that there
was no video or system shadowing under the Award BIOS, may have hurt the
machine's test performance.&P;  Processor and memory times on PC Labs' benchmark
tests were situated in the bottom third of the pack.&P;  Our Video BIOS routines
showed consistently low marks, too.&P;  The Seagate hard disk, which is rated at
15 milliseconds, tested out at 16.96 ms.&P;  in the BIOS Disk Seek test--below
average for the group.&P;  To assist the drive's performance, Precision includes
a disk caching utility supplied by the motherboard marker, Hauppauge Computer
Works.&P;  The utility, called 386 Boost, allow you to set the unit for
track-by-track caching.&M;

Also included with the 386/33 is DOS 4.01, a Hi-Tek keyboard, and a Super VGA
monitor from CTX, which scores points for its front-mounted resolution
controls.&P;  Nice features for users who have a considerable amount of graphics
to run.&M;

The system we tested was FCC certified for Class A operation only and came in
a plain desktop case that seemed strined.&P;  In fact, the chassis was strained
to flexing with the cover off.&P;  Indeed, the machine had already begun to warp
under the weight of its own components.&P;  However, these components are from
well-known manufactures, and Precision has enough confidence in them to cover
the parts for two years.&P;  The standard service warranty is for one year, and
if you can't be helped through the company's toll-free technical support
line, you'll have to ship it back to Precision if there are serious problems.&M;

This time around Precision managed to distinguish itself in only two
respects: its ability to run the Intel and Weitek coprocessors simultaneously
and its promise of memory to burn.&O;

<SUMMARY>Premier Innovations Inc's Premier 9200 microcomputer is sturdy,
expandable and affordable, but its poor processor and hard disk
performance reduce its appeal for use as a file server.&P;  The
$3,900 test configuration includes a 33-MHz 80386 microprocessor,
4Mbytes of RAM, a 64Kbyte RAM cache, 1.2Mbyte and 1.44Mbyte floppy
drives, a 177Mbyte hard disk and a Super VGA board and monitor.&O;
The Tatung motherboard holds up to 128Kbytes of cache RAM, but it
holds only 4Mbytes of RAM.&P;  A proprietary memory board can add up
to 12Mbytes of additional memory.&P;  The FCC Class B-rated tower
case has six half-height drive bays, eight expansion slots and a
230-watt power supply.&P;  The Premier's system performance ranked in
the bottom third, and its hard disk access times were the slowest
in the evaluation.&P;  The keyboard is flimsy and unpleasant to use.&O;
Premier Innovations provides one year of TRW on-site service.&M;

Premier Innovations Inc. Premier 9200 On first impression, the Premier 9200
certainly looks the part of a stalwart 24-hour-a-day LAN server.&P;  Standing
more than 27 inches high, this full-tower 33-MHz 80386-based system with its
locking case and carrying handle has all of construction and design potential
of a workhorse server.&P;  The PC Magazine Labs tests paint this machine a horse
of a different color, though.&M;

The design and engineering points are all there: front panel controls,
accommodations for up to 16MB of usable system RAM, a maximum of 128K RAM
caching, eight standard expansion slots, six half-height drive bays, a fat
230-watt power supply, and two convection-current fans to keep the CPU
running cool.&P;  All these features suggest that you could load up this machine
for network duty.&P;  The only trouble is, the $3,900 Premier 9200 con-figured
for our tests wouldn't make a particularly fast server.&P;  That specific system
includes a 4MB block of RAM, 64K of processor RAM cache, a 177MB Imprimis IDE
hard disk, and a VGA display among its features.&M;

Of all the benchmark test scores for the Premier 9200, two stand out.&P;  The
1.71-second 80386 Instruction Mix test result, in particular, indicates
overall slow system speed, placing the 9200 in the bottom third of the review
machines tested.&P;  What is more, the notably poor 9.49-second showing on the
DOS File Access test for large records, the slowest average access time of
the group, will steer potential server buyers to other machines.&P;  However,
since this result is a reflection of the 8-MHz speed of the 16-bit ISA bus,
IDE disk controller, and disk speed, the culprit may be the underpowered
Imprimis hard disk.&P;  Choosing a faster full-sized drive should improve the
throughput results, though Premier offers limited IDE and no ESDI options.&M;

Tatung makes the motherboard for the Premier 9200.&P;  Mounted with
60-nanosecond 1MB SIMM packages, the motherboard is limited to a maximum of
only 4MB of DRAM, the amount installed for review.&P;  If you want more, you'll
have to move to an expansion card.&P;  Premier offers a proprietary add-on board
holding up to 12MB of RAM.&P;  The motherboard's Intel chip set controls 64K of
20-nanosecond RAM caching.&P;  Like most of the models in this roundup, the
9200's open sockets accommodate either the Intel 80387 coprocessor or Weitek
3167 coprocessor.&P;  Shadowing of the Phoenix ROM BIOS is provided, and both
video and system shadowing can be disabled in CMOS setup when memory
conflicts arise.&M;

The 9200 arrived outfitted with a 16-bit Super VGA card, 8-bit I/O card, and
hard disk controller card.&P;  This left only four slots open (three 16-bit and
one 8-bit).&P;  After installing a LAN card, an additional memory board, a
modem, and a bus mouse, the Premier 9200 would be full.&P;  However, closer
inspection revealed that the installers didn't bother to use the 25-pin punch
outs in the back of the chassis for the second serial connector.&P;  We checked,
and the port could be moved over easily enough to free up the extra 8-bit
slot.&P;  If you want to install a tape drive, there's room for it, even with
the down-sized Imprimis hard disk and the standard 5.25-inch Panasonic and
3.5-inch Toshiba floppy disk drives installed.&M;

The 9200 comes with a Premier label VGA display coupled to a Super VGA card
with a Trident chip set.&P;  Its slow 2.69-second performancce on the Direct to
Screen test was much improved on the Video BIOS routines.&P;  Though not avail
able for review, a Super VGA screen comes with the standard system, according
to Premier.&P;  The vendor covers the 9200 with its standard one year,
parts-and-labor warranty.&M;

As a final note, the AT-style keyboard made by Forward Electronics seems a
rather unworthy companion to the 9200.&P;  The keyboard did not have the
solidity of the CPU, and its metal bottom scrapes along desk tops.&P;  Touch
typing sessions reveal that there isn't much travel in the keys.&P;  Ironically,
this only contributes to the system's workhorse impression.&P;  Onsite service
for the system is provided by TRW for a year.&P;  The machine also carries an
FCC Class B certification.&M;

With its promising appearance and feature potential, the Premier 9200 cries
out to be used as a LAN server.&P;  Unfortunately, its poor processor and disk
performance denies that appeal.&O;

Quill Corp. QTech 386-33 Judging by the Quill Corp. catalog, the QTech 386-33
seems to be aimed directly at the home office market.&P;  The QTech's sliding
smoky plastic drive bay cover and hinged reset and speaker-off button panel
adopt the familiar styling points of home electronic equipment.&P;  Similarly,
the company's mail-order office supply background and its packaging of OEM
computer components at bargain prices adopt successful home consumer
marketing practices.&P;  Mail order is hot, and at $4,040 for a system with 4MB
RAM, a 158MB hard disk, and a color VGA display among its features, the QTech
386-33 is the top catalog offering from this Illinois-based company.&P;  Quill's
base 33-MHz 386-powered PC with 1MB RAM, monochrome monitor, and no hard disk
lists at $2,499.&P;  In our tests, it certainly wasn't tops, but users looking
for a bargain shouldn't be dismayed by this machine's performance.&M;

OEM'd from Everex, the QTech's standard desktop chassis holds the motherboard
mounted with 4MB RAM, 64K maximum of RAM caching, five 16-bit slots, one
32-bit slot, one 8-bit slot, an open socket for either the Weitek 3167 or
Intel 80387 coprocessor, a Chips and Technologies chip set, and an integrated
disk controller.&M;

The system's 16-bit ISA bus can be toggled to run at a maximum of 16 MHz, and
the system has three keyboard-selectable operating speeds of 11 MHz, 16 MHz,
and 33 MHz.&P;  In the machine that we reviewed, two slots were occupied by the
8-bit Magic I/O card and a 16-bit Everex VGA card.&P;  For usable memory, up to
16MB of RAM may be installed in 80-nanosecond 256K and 1MB SIMM packages--8MB
on the system board for $700 and 8MB on 32-bit proprietary card for $1,670.&M;

You'll find other companies, such as Spear, peddling nearly identical
machines.&P;  You won't, however, see similar offerings from Everex.&P;  A separate
division of that well-known manufacturer is responsible for OEM equipment.&M;

The QTech 386-33's performance on PC Labs' processor and memory benchmark
tests showed the machine holding its own with the rest of the tightly knit
pack, so power users shouldn't be disappointed.&P;  True, hard disk access times
on the $1,200 158MB Maxtor system were not the best, with the 62.13-second
DOS File Access (Small Records) test time ranking it in the bottom third.&O;
But the unit's respectable large records access speed of 4.78 seconds means
the QTech could be pressed into service to manage a small LAN.&M;

Times on the Direct to Screen and Video BIOS routines, while certainly not
the worst, also fell into the bottom third of this issue's covenant of 33-MHz
386 PCs.&P;  Considering that the QTech doesn't offer video BIOS shadowing, the
times aren't bad.&P;  If you're dong CAD/CAM work, however, you may want
slightly better video performance, and you probably would want more detail
than that yielded by the 14-inch Leading Technologies color monitor reviewed
here.&M;

Evidence of standard expandability is found in the QTech's AT-style case,
which allows room for five half-height drives.&P;  The system came with a TEAC
1.2MB floppy disk drive and the full-sized Maxtor hard disk.&P;  A 3.5-inch
floppy disk drive from the Quill catalog will set you back another $90,
leaving one half-height drive bay vacant for additional storage needs.&O;
Though our unit didn't have a second serial port, one can easily be added
without taking up an additional slot.&P;  A game port also can be added for a
nominal charge.&M;

A familiar Key Tronic AT-style keyboard--one cherished by many PC
users--comes with this FCC Class B machine.&P;  Though the QTech's slim
documentation will occasionally leave the first-time user in the dark, the
potential buyers of this mail-order system aren't likely to be driven from
this fairly proiced, expandable system.&O;

SAI Systems Laboratories Inc. SAI 386/33 SAI Systems Laboratory really wants
you to buy one of its computers.&P;  The company's functional base machine, a
$1,995 system fitted with 1MB RAM, 40MB hard disk, and monochrome display,
makes the SAI 386/33 seem like low-cost booty of the 386 dollar war.&P;  Even
with a configuration upgrade to PC Magazine's standard 4MB of RAM, 64K RAM
cache, a 1.2MB or 1.44MB floppy, a 150MB hard disk, a Super VGA display
setup, and DOS 4.01, SAI's 33-MHz machine is a comparative steal at $3,395.&M;

Make no mistake, this is a no-frills computer.&P;  The case is a standard AT box
with five half-height bays, three of which have front access.&P;  Its standard
reset and turbo buttons are controlled from the front panel.&P;  Power for the
386/33 is supplied by a 200-watt Le Amatic unit.&P;  Take the cover off and
you'll find evidence of major diagonal flex in the chassis.&P;  As with any mail
order computer, you are well advised to remove the cover and check that all
of the boards and chips are firmly seated in their slots and sockets.&M;

Inside the case you'll find an 80-Data motherboard with two 8-bit and six
16-bit slots.&P;  The installed VGA card, disk controller, and I/O board leave
five slots available for expansion.&P;  Discrete components take the place of a
large scale integrated 80386 chip set, but AMI BIOS chips are plainly visible
for those who need the comfort of a name brand.&P;  Likewise, an Intel 82386
cache controller directs the 64K of 20-nanosecond cache RAM that link the
processor to the installed 4MB of 80-ns.&P;  system RAM.&P;  The motherboard will
handle 8MB of system RAM in SIP configuration before you'll need to resort to
an add-in card to take the system up to its 16MB maximum.&M;

For review, SAI provided a $300 200MB Conner Peripherals IDE hard disk with
the machine that PC Labs' BIOS Disk Seek test clocked at a 15.88 millisecond
average access time.&P;  While this is a fast access time, the drive is leashed
to an embedded AT controller that hinders the true throughput potential.&P;  SAI
offers 80MB, 150MB, 300MB, and 600MB alternative ESDI drives at $700, $995,
$1,895, and $3,295, respectively, that couldn't help but improve access
times.&M;

Video is the performance bonus from the SAI 386/33.&P;  Although devoid of any
name, the 16-bit VGA card carries a Western Digital chip set and did quite
well on PC Labs' video BIOS scrolling benchmarks with elapsed times of 0.33
and 1.04 seconds.&P;  Coupled with the NEC 3D monitor, the display system is
more than adequate for video intensive software applications.&M;

Two words describe the SAI 386/33 documentation: slim and none.&P;  Four manuals
arrived with the system and it's a stretch to actually call them manuals.&O;
Two of them are for the VGA card, one covering the hardware and the other
describing the VGA utility software.&P;  NEC's own user manual for the 3D
monitor was included, of course, and the quartet was completed with a 22-page
document describing the various options available on the 80-Data motherboard.&O;
You won't find documentation and guidance on system operations and setup.&M;

Naturally, none of that will matter if you're one of the personal computing
cognoscente.&P;  Indeed, the SAI 386/33 may be best appreciated by those who
need a limited amount of support.&P;  Its lack of an FCC Class B rating keeps it
from being a home machine of choice, but it could be a good machine to stock
hackers and programmers in your shop.&O;

Swan Technologies Swan 386/33 Forget the analogies; the Swan 386/33 computer
is neither graceful nor flighty.&P;  Locked in a tower case, its 4MB of RAM, 64K
of cache memory, 200Mb hard disk, and Super VGA display system lets you into
the realm of 33-MHz 386 computing for $4,344 at our standard configuration.&O;
The budget conscious can save $250 by opting for the desktop version, but
there's something about a 33-MHz machine that begs for the stronger
impression of a tower case.&M;

When submitted for review, the machine had no FCC Class B rating; if
certification comes through, however, the Swan 386/33 would make an ideal
power system for the office at home.&M;

Swan's front-access tower case, which holds 6 half-height drives, puts large
round power, reset, and turbo buttons up top where they're easily accessible.&O;
The power button is color-coded green.&P;  Since the legends on the case are
difficult to read, the reset and turbo vuttons would benefit from color
coding to prevent accidents.&M;

As reviewed, the Swan included both 3.5- and 5.25-inch floppy disk drives,
plus a 200MB Conner Peripherals hard disk.&P;  The system's 230-watt power
supply and additional fan provide power and cooling for up to six devices in
its bays.&P;  Five half-height bays and a 200-watt power supply come with the
desktop version.&M;

Swan chose an 8-slot Micronics ASIC motherboard as the platform for its
386/33 computer.&P;  The hallmark of this motherboard is its reliance on a
single large-scale integrated chip to handle DMA and interrupts, while the
balance of the 80386 functions are relegated to discrete integrated chips.&O;
The Micronics board uses an Intel 82385 to direct the 2-way associative RAM
cache and the reviewed machine contained 64K of 25-nanosecond devices.&P;  They
link the processor to 4Mb of 80-ns.&P;  system RAM in 1MB SIMM packages.&P;  Should
you need to expand the system beyond this 4MB motherboard maximum, additional
RAM can be added to the system's o2-bit slot to bring the 386/33 to its 16MB
limit.&P;  Swan sells memory upgrades in 2MB increments.&P;  The first upgrade
includes the memory board and sells for $249.&P;  A 4MB jump boosts the price of
the option to $469.&M;

PC Labs' benchmark tests for the 80386 Instruction Mix, Floating-Point
Calculation Without Coprocessor, and Conventional Memory show the Swan 386/33
as a performance checkerboard.&P;  Its processor and RAM performance set the
machine firmly among all but the slowest of the machines reviewed.&P;  Though
the Swan fared well among processors, it lost its performance edge in the
disk access tests.&P;  The strength of Swan's 16.55-millisecond drive carries it
through the small record DOS File Access test competitively at 55.07 seconds.&O;
However, the 5.41-second throughput speed displayed in the large record DOS
File Access test is where the system's edge dulls.&P;  A quality ESDI hard disk
would do the job, but an ESDI option is not listed among those Swan sells.&M;

Then there's video.&P;  Visually, the Qume Multiscan 850 monitor is excellent.&O;
Swan's generic 16-bit VGA card, with a Tseng Labs chip set, brings the
386/33's sharp performance back with exceptional numbers on the Direct to
Screen and Video BIOS Routines.&P;  It's noteworthy to mention that the Swan
386/33 is bereft of video and BIOS shadowing.&P;  The system earns the good
processor and video numbers without its benefit.&P;  Should you want to add
shadowing, a utility disk included with the 386/33 contains sosftware that
will reserve an area of memory and implement shadowing.&P;  It might be an
interesting experiment to see what additional performance gains you can eke
out of the Swan, but if you're running software that works in protected mode,
such as Windows, the Swan 386/33 works well enough in stock trim to make
shadowing a dubious choice.&M;

Neither an FCC Class A certification nor an irregular dip in hard disk
performance can prevent the Swan 386/33 from getting a strong recommendation
as an ideal home or small office machine.&O;

<SUMMARY>Tandon North America's Tandon 386/33 microcomputer has excellent
hard disk performance, but the system as a whole has only average
performance and a midrange price.&P;  The $4,999 test configuration
includes a 33-MHz 80386 microprocessor, 4Mbytes of RAM, a 64Kbyte
RAM cache, a 200 Mbyte hard disk, a 1.2Mbyte or 1.44Mbyte floppy
drive, a mouse and a Super VGA board and monitor.&P;  The
Micronics/Tandon motherboard holds the 64Kbytes of cache RAM, but
all system memory is stored on a 32-bit add-in card.&P;  The memory
card can hold up to 8Mbytes of RAM, and a daughtercard can hold up
to 8Mbytes of additional memory.&P;  The Tandon hard disk's large
record throughput was the second-fastest in the group, but the
video performance is below average in most benchmarks.&P;  Tandon
offers good manuals, a one-year warranty covering parts and labor,
and optional on-site service contracts.&M;

Tandon North America Tandon 386/33 If you're a manufacturer beset by
blistering competition in one area, you might look to expand into other
areas.&P;  Give Tandon credit for being able to take the heat in the crowded
kitchen of desktop computing.&P;  Long known for its premier line of hard disks,
Tandon's latest entree on the 33-MHz 386 menu is a machine that, under PC
Magazine's standard configuration of 4MB RAM, 64K cache memory, 110MB hard
drive, a choice of 1.2 or 1.4MB floppy drives, monochrome VGA display, 2
serial and 1 parallel ports, and DOS 4.01, lists for $3,999.&M;

As delivered for testing, the Tandon 386/33 came with 4MB of RAM, a single
1.2MB floppy drive, 200MB hard disk, and a Super VGA display system bundled
with DOS 4.01, Windows 3.0 and a Microsoft Mouse for a $4,999 package.&P;  For
about $1,000 more (excluding Windows and the mouse), the manufacturer offers
the same standard configuration with 256K caching memory, a Princeton
Graphics or NEC 14-inch display, and choice of floppy disk drives.&M;

Tandon's pastel stripe has become a signature for its products.&P;  Here a
turquoise strip marks the top of the soft, rounded edges of this desktop
enclosure.&P;  Under the sylized face plate, the chassis is a conventional AT
design with five half-height drive bays, three of which have front access.&O;
Atypical for 80386-based systems, the power supply with this case is rated at
only 190 watts.&M;

The platform for the Tandon 386/33 shares Micronics and Tandon labels.&P;  The
motherboard uses discrete components to govern 80386 operations in lieu of
large scale integrated circuits.&P;  Intel's 82385 processor controls the 64K of
RAM cache and while the review system contained 20-nanosecond static RAM
chips.&P;  Tandon switched to 25-ns.&P;  devices just after the machine wa shipped
for testing.&P;  More than likely, the performance diferential will be
negligible.&M;

Of the eight slots in the motherboard, one is used by the video card, and
another is the home for the combination floppy drive controller,
parallel/serial interface, and an embedded AT controller link to the 16-bit
ISA bus.&P;  A third is a proprietary 32-bit memory expansion slot that provides
all of the system memory and held 4 megabytes of memory in 256K and 1MB DIP
packaging with an 80-ns rating.&P;  Tandon claims a 16MB maximum for the system,
with 8MB on the card itself and an additional 8MB on a daughtercard at an
upgrade cost of $369 per 4MB of RAM.&P;  PC Labs' suite of processor and memory
benchmark test show no apparent performance loss with the use of carded
memory.&M;

With the build-up about Tandon's hard disks, it would be disappointing if the
200MB drive in this machine didn't live up to its reputation.&P;  It does, with
a scorching 4.09-second score on the large record DOS File Access test and a
respectable 15.03 millisecond time on the BIOS Disk Seek test.&P;  Naturally it
bears the Tandon logo, but while this 15-ms.&P;  IDE drive scores an average
rating for small record handling, its large record results are exemplary.&P;  It
gobbles down large bits of data, displaying the second fastest throughput
time of the group for this test segment.&M;

Tandon's choice of video cards is not as pleasing.&P;  Here too, the 16-bit
Super VGA card carries the Tandon name.&P;  The Zymos chip set keeps video
order, but its performance falls well below average in all but the Video BIOS
Routines Without Scrolling.&P;  Tandon lists no other video board options even
though the system would certainly benefit from the added speed of something
like an Orchid ProDesigner II card.&P;  Visually, the companion Princeton
Graphics Ultra 14 monitor provides excellent color and crisp character
representations.&P;  The pair prove adequate for most applications that are not
video intensive.&M;

On a strict dollar basis it's difficult to distinguish Tandon's 386/33
computer from many of the others in this review.&P;  Its one-year warranty on
parts and labor is nearly standard at this point, as is the onsite service
plans that are optionally available.&P;  Even the manuals are not distinct
enough to give the computer an edge.&P;  The main advantage this sytem enjoys is
the superlative hard disk performance which makes the 386/33 a logical choice
for environments with demanding hard disk needs.&O;

Tatung Co. of America Inc. Tatung TCS-8600T/33 Tatung has dropped the second
shoe with the 33-Mhz version of its TCS-8600T cache computer.&P;  While you
won't be getting the most expensive computer reviewed, you will pay a $5,499
premium for the 4MB of RAM, 150MB hard disk, and VGA display system in the
tower configured to PC Magazine's standard.&P;  However, Tatung may well have
found a good combination of components to justify that premium.&M;

The tower enclosure is solidly built and containts six half-height bays.&O;
Front panel controls include power, reset, and turbo switces with LEDs to
indicate turbo mode and hard disk activity.&P;  A hefty 230-watt power supply
comes with the tower, and Tatung has tacked on an additional cooling fan at
the front of the unit to counter heat problems.&M;

Tatung claims this eight-slot motherboard as its own.&P;  The board's 64K of
20-nanosecond RAM cache for the Intel 82385 holds sockets for an additional
64K.&P;  BIOS functions are governed by a Phoenix ROM, and ther's an open socket
for an 80387 coprocessor.&P;  The system's ISA bus is rated for speeds of 7 MHz
and 12 MHz.&M;

The 7600T/33's 16MB maximum of system RAM capacity is defined in part by the
standard 4MB of 80-ns.&P;  motherboard mounted SIMM packages, the most that will
fit.&P;  Normally, further expansion requires buying an add-in board, but Tatung
drops that requirement--as far as paying for one is concerned.&P;  The 12MB
expansion card is actually a daughter-board mounted with 1MB SIMMs that
attaches directly to the motherboard and is included with the system--albeit
without the chips.&M;

When PC Magazine last looked at the 25-Mhz version of Tatung's tower, it was
filled to overflowing with a 300MB ESDI drive.&P;  While not as impressive for
its sheer physical size, the $1,200 150MB Seagate ESDI unit in this computer
displays above-average performance in the DOS File ACess tests for small and
large records.&P;  The tradeoff in drive also means a lower overall price that
moves the TCS-8600T/33 closer to its competition.&P;  The upgrade to 300MB would
bump the price up by $400 and there's also a 600MB ESDI drive available for
an additional $1,250 should you decide to make the 8600T/33 a server.&M;

As you might expect from a company that was primary a monitor manufacturer,
the Tatung CM-1496 monitor is excellent.&P;  This version is a VGA-only display,
with the $799 1,024-by-768 CM-1498X Super VGA display an available option.&O;
The comparison TVGA-16 video card is a 16-bit VGA device, but it has little
performance to offer on either PC Labs Video BIOS with Scrolling or Direct to
Screen tests.&P;  The Paradise chip set doesn't tow the mark on this card.&O;
Tatung offes a Super VGA card called the Omni-VGA that may boost peformance.&M;

At first glance the documentation for the system won't look like much at all,
but the small, spiral bound manual is deceptive.&P;  Typeset on slick paper, it
provides a walk through the computer's setup and operations in simple
language.&P;  If this isn't your first computer you can ignore the manual; if
it's your first machine you'll love the extra help.&M;

Tatung isn't dragging its heels in the service and support areas either.&O;
Both parts and labor are covered for a full year with 120 days of on-site
coverage after purchase provided by Memorex Telex.&P;  It's a nice concession to
the fact that most problems occur during the first three months of ownership.&O;
support is no further away than your telephone, and if the few calls needed
to confirm how the TCS-8600T/33 works are any measure of their
responsiveness, Tatung should proved relatively fast and reliable.&M;

While the $500 to $1,500 premium you'll pay for this system may seem harsh,
it is an FCC Class B device that fits best into your office at home.&O;
Tatung's choice of an ESDI drive and the addition of onsite service are
premium features and they cost money.&P;  Fortunately, it's money well spent on
this system.&O;

Televideo Systems Inc. Televideo Tele386e Once known only a a manufacturer of
network terminals, Televideo's product line now includes 80386-based machines
for the 33-MHz environment.&P;  Televideo's Tele386e is not an outstanding
example of the genre, and configured to our standard 4MB of RAM, 200MB hard
disk and VGA display system, its $7,609 price tag outdistances the majority
of the field.&P;  Performance potential and Televideo's on-site service and
support package make the machine worth looking at, though.&M;

Televideo's eight-slot motherboard is an enigma of sorts.&P;  While Televideo
claims the board as its own, a silk-screened emblem under the stick-on label
pronounces the board's point of origin as Wong's Electric Co.&P;  Be that as it
may, there's no masking the motherboard's performance.&P;  While discrete logic
makes up for the lack of a large scale integrated 80386 chip set, AMI
provides the BIOS that motivates the machine.&P;  An Intel 82385 cache
controller manages the 64K of 20-nanosecond static RAM.&P;  Together with the
4MB block of 80-ns.&P;  system RAM, the Tele386e motherboard manages to rank
solidly among the top performers.&P;  Be mindful that this is one of the handful
of motherboards that does not use either system or video BIOS shadowing to
garner its position.&M;

Memory expansion is provided on the motherboard to a maximum of 8MB while
additional upgrades beyond that level require a plug-in memory card for the
Tele386e's proprietary 32-bit slot.&P;  The add-in board carries 100-ns.&P;  Simms
which are extremely slow for a 33-MHZ computer.&P;  Normally the cache will
absorb the disparity, but it's likely that the system could experience up to
three wait states on a cache miss.&M;

Atypical for many of the systems reviewed is Televideo's choice of hard
disks.&P;  It's a $539 Maxtor LXT-200S SCSI hard disk and it bucks the trend of
machines usinf embedded AT drive controllers.&P;  Whether or not there's any
rela performance gain is dubious since the drive was literally clobbered by
the DOS File Access test using small records.&P;  The SCSI interface comes into
better light when viewed from the results of our test using large records.&O;
Here the interface's inherently faster throughput potential boosts the drive
into the top five.&M;

For a company that made its name in video terminals, one would hope for video
greatness from Televideo.&P;  The reality is that the Tele386e's 13-inch
Televideo/Samsung VM200 video system shows greatness in appearance only, not
on the PC Labs suite of video tests.&P;  On the Direct to Screen test, the
display's 16-bit Western Digital VGA card, with Paradise chip set, scores a
reasonable 2.08-second time on direct writes to the video hardware.&P;  However,
the system becomes recalcitrant when asked to perform Video BIOS Routine
functions--nearly the slowest times of the test group.&P;  This board is the
only video option Televideo lists, so it's not an easy workaround.&M;

The documentation that was shipped with the Tele386e for review arrived in
prerelease format as a packet of galley proof pages.&P;  If the printed manual
retains the content of its galleys, it should prove helpful to the owner with
a modicum of personal computing exprerience, but many be a less helpful guide
for inexperienced users.&M;

Televideo backs the Tele386e for one-year on parts, labor, and on-site
service; a plus for corporate or personal buyers.&P;  Despite a Class A FCC
certification that relegates this machine to the office environment, the
documentation describes it as a Class B device.&P;  Our assumption is that the
Class B rating is pending from the FCC despite Televideo's failure to provide
a certificate number to verify the upgrade.&P;  Even so, the relatively high
price of the computer might intimidate potential home buyers.&O;

Tenex Computer Express&M;

Tenex 386C-33&M;

Power Column&M;

When you get right down to it, there's really nothing remarkable about
another 33-MHz 386 tower enclosure with 4MB of RAM, a 150MB hard disk, and a
VGA display system.&P;  But discover a mail-order machine with a two-year
warranty, the first year covered by on-site service, tie a $3,965 price tag
to the package, and back it up with swift and solid computing performance and
you can almost hear hands slapping wallet leather to get to the credit card
number.&M;

The Tenex 386C-33 Power Column closely resembles that of the Swan computer,
with the same arrangement of three large front-mounted power, reset, and
turbo mode buttons.&P;  Here, no distinction is made in the color of button to
denote their function.&P;  As with the Swan enclosure, the legends on the case
are sufficiently indiscernible at a distance to mandate some more visible
marking to separate the turbo and reset buttons.&P;  The case holds five
half-height drives, with three having front access capability.&P;  As tested,
the Power Column holds both 1.2MB and 1.44MB floppy disk drives, as well as a
Micropolis hard disk.&P;  Tenex opts for a 200-watt DTK power supply for this
system, and adds a second cooling fan in the event you actually fill all of
the drive bays.&M;

The Power Column's eight-slot motherboard with 16-bit ISA bus comes from DTK,
as is the system BIOS.&P;  This isn't a high-tech motherboard by any means.&O;
Discrete components are used almost exclusively, and they replace the more
typical large scale circuits that would normally be employed as the 80386
chip set and processor RAM cache controller.&P;  Nonetheless, the DTK
motherboard offers plenty of computing prowess.&P;  Its performance among PC
Labs' 80386 Instruction Mix, Floating-Point Calculation, and Conventional
Memory tests give it a firm foothold within the top third of the machines
reviewed.&M;

The DTK board comes with 64K of 20-nanosecond cac he RAM and can accommodate
up to 8MB of on-board system memory expansion.&P;  Beyond that, Tenex can supply
you with a $105 memory expansion board for the system's 32-bit proprietary
slot and fill it at the rate of approximately $90 per megabyte up to the 16MB
maximum limit.&M;

A 15.30-second 150MB Micropolis hard disk came with the system and the
notably slow results for DOS File Access are somewhat misleading as to the
drive's actual performance capability.&P;  The ESDI controller, standard with
this system, contains a 32K disk cache that was disabled for testing.&P;  With
the cache in effect, expect a marked improvement in the drive's access
performance.&M;

Video performance is the caveat for this machine.&P;  The 16-bit generic VGA
board with Trident chip set ran far below average, at 2.52 seconds, on the
Direct to Screen test of the video hardware.&P;  However, the Video BIOS routine
times were much more in line with the competition.&P;  It's quite probable that
video BIOS shadowing gave th video card the needed boost in performance.&M;

Tenex will not go down in history as a supplier of fine manuals.&P;  Four
booklets are included with the system and they cover the motherboard, case,
video card, and I/O board.&P;  Cardboard bound and three hole punched,
experienced users will find them chock full of information about the
technical setup of the various components, but novices who venture into
mail-order purchases should make note of Tenex's phone support line.&M;

Documentation aside, there are a number of support and service pluses from
Tenex that make this system quite desirable.&P;  First and foremost is the
company's 30-day free trial policy that lets you see the system in operation
where you use it, how you see it.&P;  The company's two-year warranty is
basically phone service with parts swapping should the problem be physical
rather than procedural, but it doesn't hurt.&P;  And during the first year of
the warranty, Tenex will even dispatch TRW to your site should the situation
get out of hand.&O;

Texas Micro Systems Inc.&M;

Texas Micro Systems 3014&M;

Texas Micro Systems caters to laboratory and industrial uses with the 3014,
its rack-mount 33-MHz 386.&P;  This rugged, heavy-duty system offers PC
Magazine's standard 64K RAM cache, 4MB of RAM, a 150MB hard disk, 1.44MB and
1.2MB floppy disk drives, and a Super VGA display for $8,515.&M;

The 3014 is designed to be mounted horizontally on a rack with other
equipment rather than positioned on a desktop or the floor.&P;  It's also
tailored to withstand the sort of wear and tear encountered in a lab or
factory setting rather than an office environment.&P;  As testimony to this, a
clear plastic door with a key lock covers the floppy disk drives to protect
them from dust and a bracket fits over the expansion cards to keep them from
popping out because of vibration.&P;  Two fans ensure adequate ventilation in
hot conditions.&M;

The unit sports 14 expansion slots to accommodate the most stringent
telecommunication needs.&P;  On our test unit, two of these were 8-bit and the
rest were 16-bit, but you can optionally replace the 8-bit slots with 16-bit
ones.&P;  The 3014's 16-bit ISA bus is software switchable between 8.25 MHz and
11 MHz.&M;

A CPU card takes the place of a moutned motherboard and holds the 80386
processor, the OPTI and Chips and Technologies chip set, an optional 80387
coprocessor, and all the system RAM.&P;  one serial and one parallel port are
also mounted on the card, with a second serial port accessible through an
optional cable and I/O bracket that take up a second slot.&P;  In the event of
failure, replacement is simple as pulling the CPU card and swapping it for
another.&M;

The CPU card will hold up to 16MB of 32-bit RAM, using 1MB SIMMs.&P;  It also
sports a 64K 35-nanosecond RAM cache, which can be upgraded to 128K.&P;  A
shadow RAM option available from the setup menu lets you relocate not only
video and system BIOS, but also any BIOS on the bus.&M;

Our test system came with a 150MB Control Data ESDI hard drive.&P;  The vendor
offers various lower-capacity drive options ranging from 20MB to 104MB IDE
configurations, but you'll have to go elsewhere for larger disks.&P;  The test
unit included both 1.2MB and 1.44MB floppy disk drives, both mounted
vertically.&M;

Despite the 3014's industrial-strength capabilities in other areas and its
substantial size, it has less drive bay capacity than many midrange desktop
units.&P;  There's room for only two full-height drives and one 3.5-inch
half-height drive, and the power supply offers only four device connectors.&M;

Texas Micro Systems provided its own 16-bit Super VGA card with 1024-by-768
resolution built around the Tseng Labs chip set with 1MB of onboard RAM.&P;  The
card includes both a 15-pin and a 9-pin connector.&P;  The vendor also provided
a Sony Super VGA monitor with the test machine.&M;

The EECO 101-key enhanced keyboard has a firm feel but no tactile click or
enlarged backspace key.&P;  It does provide extra key caps for reversing the
positions of the Ctrl and Caps Lock keys.&M;

Considering its hefty price tag, the 3014 turned in rather disappointing
performances on our benchmark tests.&P;  It fell near the bottom of the heap on
both the 80386 Instruction Mix and Floating-Point Calculation tests.&P;  Its
scores on the Conventional Memory and disk speed tests were middling at best.&O;
Only on the video tests did it turn in above-average scores.&M;

The Texas Micro Systems 3014 targets a specialized market with its rugged
rack-mount design and its plethora of expansion slots.&P;  Users with a need for
these particular features will find it a solid machine, despite its
lackluster benchmark results.&P;  Some may find its mass storage limitations a
problem, though.&O;

Transource Computers&M;

Verxion 386/33&M;

From the great southwest, land of 120-degree summer days, comes Transource
Computers aiming to put a chill on hot and heavy pricing for 33-MHz 386
computing.&P;  This Phoenix-based company slaps a $3,699 midrange sticker on its
Verxion 386/33.&P;  At this price, the Verxion conforms to PC Magazine's
standard 4MB of RAM, 64K RAM cache, 150MB hard disk, 1.2MB or 1.44MB floppy
disk drives, two serial and one parallel ports, and a Super VGA display
system configuration.&P;  It happens to be Transource's base system setup for
this machine, also.&M;

Those looking to strip off options to push the price of this unit down a few
degrees will be disappointed.&P;  But at a price like this, who would want to?&O;
Here the only anomaly is that you can't buy DOS directly from Transource; you
have to get it from Microsoft.&M;

Transource houses the Verxion in a sturdy tower case with a top-carrying
handle that provides easy access to the internal unit with removable back and
side panels made of plastic and metal.&P;  Fold-out legs support the 386/33.&O;
Its interior design is clean, though the 80387 socket is partially covered by
the hard disk.&P;  In addition, a full-length card seated in the number 1 slot
restricts access to system board's jumpers.&P;  The mother-board-mounted serial
and parallel ports leave five 16-bit and one 8-bit slots free in our standard
configuration.&P;  As a bonus, there's even a PS/2 mouse port on the back of the
unit, and the system will support up to four serial and two parallel ports.&O;
However, if you want to install extra ports, you'll have to disable those on
the motherboard before adding I/O expansion boards.&P;  The 16-bit ISA bus speed
is fixed at a slow 8 MHz.&M;

RAM upgrades for the Verxion 386/33 require IBM SIMM packages, which
Transource makes available for an inexpensive $100 per megabyte of RAM.&P;  With
room for 8MB of 80-ns.&P;  RAM on the motherboard, and two 32-bit expansion
slots that will hold a maximum of 16 additional megabytes each, there's the
opportunity to load the system with a whopping 40MB of usable RAM.&P;  Chances
are you'll never need this much memory, so the 32-bit slots are more likely
to used to hold standard 16-bit cards.&P;  The 25-ns.&P;  RAM cache can also be
upgraded from 64K to 128K.&M;

On PC Labs' benchmark tests, processor and memory scores place the Verxion
386/33 well in the middle of the pack.&P;  Tied to a Western Digital controller,
the 150MB Seagate Technologies ESDI drive, with a 17.18-millisecond BIOS Disk
Seek access time, was not an outstanding performer when compared with the
competition.&P;  For those not satisfied with the unit's standard drive,
Transource offers reasonably priced 300MB or 600MB ESDI or SCSI options, too.&O;
Since the chassis has room for three full-height drive bays, there's ample
room for adding extras storage devices to suit your needs.&M;

As for video performance, the Verxion's 16-bit MIT graphics adapter with
Paradise chip set, and the swivel-mounted 13-inch Voltron monitor, support
Super VGA resolutions.&P;  The display system scored well in the Video BIOS
routines with times of 0.33 seconds in the without scrolling trials and 1.10
seconds in the with scrolling trials.&P;  Its Direct to Screen time of 2.03
seconds is about average for the systems tested.&M;

On the tactile front, the machine's Monterey keyboard will satisfy users who
prefer a light feel and a click in the key pads.&P;  The keyboard sports an
enlarged backspace key and extra-large arrows on the cursor keys.&P;  Its only
oddity is a blank, unimplemented macro key between the left Ctrl and Alt
keys.&M;

Overall, if you're in the market for solid performance and don't want to
worry about too many option decisions, yet still need some expansion
flexibility, the Transource Verxion 386/33 is an attractive purchase.&P;  For
its price, this fully loaded unit beats the base price of a good many
competitors.&O;

Unisys Corp.&M;

Unisys Personal Workstation Series 800/33A&M;

The Unisys Personal Workstation Series 800/33A carries an extraordinary price
tag for an otherwise ordinary 33-MHz 80386-based machine.&P;  PC Magazine's
standard configuration, including 4MB of RAM, 64K RAM cache, 140MB SCSI hard
disk, 1.44MB floppy disk drive, and color VGA display, will have the buyer
laying out $9,970.&P;  Add a math coprocessor and your looking $10,965.&P;  Even
the manufacturer's $7,622 base system with monochrome VGA and no hard drive
presents a formidable line item justification task on any budget.&M;

For your money you get a tower case with room inside for eight expansion
slots--one 8-bit, five 16-bit, and two 32-bit memory board slots that also
can accommodate standard 16-bit cards.&P;  Power for the system is provided by a
303.5-watt unit with connections for five devices.&P;  The motherboard holds two
serial and one parallel ports, leaving six slots free in the tested unit.&O;
Its 16-bit ISA bus is rated for 8 MHZ and the processor speed can be switch
selected down to 8 MHz from the keyboard.&M;

On the motherboard, the 800/33A's standard 4MB worth of RAM can be expanded
to 8MB using 1MB SIMM packages.&P;  In addition, an impressive system total of
24MB of usable 32-bit RAM can be rached using two optional memory boards
holding up to 8MB of SIMMs each.&P;  You can't upgrade beyond the 64K of
25-nanosecond static RAM cache, though.&P;  The unit's video and BIOS relocation
in RAM is available through the system setup menu.&M;

PC Labs' DOS File Access tests and BIOS Disk Seek times rate the
Unisys-labeled 140MB hard disk and its SCSI controller as bottom of the pack
performers.&P;  Even ignoring the 23.32-millisecond BIOS Disk Seek, which
doesn't accurately reflect the speed of SCSI devices, the disk scored the
second slowest result, at 67.59 seconds, in the DOS File Access time for
small records.&P;  The Unisys 800/33A did somewhat better with large records on
the same test, but at 5.28 seconds, still remains too near the bottom of the
charts to alter the negative impression.&M;

There's room in the chassis for the standard two full-height and one
half-height drive bays, and Unisys offers fairly standard SCSI hard disk
options ranging from a $795 40MB unit to a $2,595 300MB drive.&P;  Other drive
options from Unisys include a choice of a 1.44MB or 1.2MB floppy disk drive,
and a $1,195 internal 135Mb quarter-inch tape unit.&M;

Video performance from the 16-bit Western Digital VGA card and a 13-inch
Unisys Super VGA monitor showed a pronounced gap between the Direct to Screen
test and the Video BIOS routines.&P;  A dismal 4.51-second time was recorded on
the Direct to Screen test and above average times on the Video BIOS Without
Scrolling and Video BIOS with Scrolling tests of 0.27- and 1.31-seconds were
recorded, respectively.&M;

Externally, the PErsonal Workstation 800/33A has a bit of an identity
problem.&P;  Unisys markets the computer as a tower unit with the floppy drive
bays, logo, LEDs, and power switch oriented vertivally on the case.&P;  In every
other way the unit follows the standard PC-AT horizontal desktop design from
its rubber feet on the side to the manufacturer's separate plastic stand for
tower mode.&P;  You even have to position the machine horizontally to remove the
chassis.&P;  The Personal Workstation's 101-key enhanced keyboard has a solid
feel and an exceptionally long 108-inch cable.&P;  For a price, there are other
extras that can be had from Unisys including Microsoft Windows 3.0 bundled
with DOS 4.01 for $195, and Microsoft Mouse for $99.&M;

Unisys' Personal Workstation Series 800/33A has a Class B FCC certification
and an on-site service option; despite its premium price, it has little to
set it apart from the competition.&O;

Wang Laboratories Inc. Wang PC 350/33C Back in the 1980s, Wang was one of the
progenitors of the Massachusetts Miracle, and like the commonwealth, the
Lowell-based company now has fallen on lean times.&P;  However, lean is not a
word that can be applied to the small-footprint Wang PC 350/33C's pricing.&P;  A
fat $9,885 will buy a little microcomputing miracle matching PC Magazine's
standard configuration.&M;

Stocked for testing with 4MB of RAM, 64K of 25-nanosecond RAM cache, a 200MB
IDE hard disk, a 16-bit VGA display system, and two half-height floppy
drives, the PC 350/33C's price tag crosses the five-figure mark, to $10,130.&O;
The good news is PC Labs' benchmark tests rate it a consistently able
performer across the suite of tests.&P;  What's more, the PC 350/33C is a
guaranteed platform for Wang's fine line of products, including its two-page
display system, network cards, scanners, and hand and voice annotation
devices.&P;  Customers doing image processing and computer-aided design will
appreciate that all the peripherals they buy will be compatible and fully
supported by a single manufacturer.&M;

True to Wang's workstation roots, the system supports several operating
systems (DOS, OS/2, Unix, Xenix, and SCO), but the company provides users
with only system setup, diagnostics, and memory management software as
standard features.&M;

On the outside, the PC 350/33C is compact and stylish.&P;  Only its unique
monitor swivel draws attention to the machine's physique.&P;  On the inside, a
system board map, with switch setting guides, is the first thing you see.&M;

The second thing you notice is that two of the eight expansion slots are
tucked under the 145-watt power supply.&P;  Precious space is purchased at the
price of expansion options.&P;  A 16-bit Video Seven VGA card and a Western
Digital controller card, with two serial and one parallel I/O ports, leave
only four usable slots open inside the chassis.&M;

The Micronics motherboard holds 4MB of 80-nanosecond system RAM and sockets
for an Intel 80387 or Weitek 3167 coprocessor.&P;  Wang offers a 32-bit add-in
memory card filled with up to 12MB of 1MB or 256K SIMMs to bring the usable
memory total to 16MB.&P;  BIOS functions are controlled with a Phoenix ROM and
the system's 16-bit ISA bus is rated for 8 MHz.&P;  Video and system BIOS
shadowing is handled by a hard switch on the motherboard.&M;

Wang's IDE technology drive options range from a $500 20MB unit to $2,500
200MB drive.&P;  The 200MB Conner hard disk installed in this system proved
itself to be an average performer in our tests, but its processor and memory
times keep it competitive with the group.&P;  While Wang's 14-inch VGA system
shines in the Video BIOS routines, its Direct to Screen times were average,
at best.&P;  However, Wang offers an impressive listing of video system options.&M;

SUPPORT STRENGTH&M;

The real strength in this machine lies in its warranty, service, and support
features.&P;  The PC 350/33C is sold through dealers, value-added resellers, and
directly from Wang.&P;  Service is available either through dealers, or at a
worldwide network of Wang service centers.&P;  Technical support is available by
telephone during extended business hours.&M;

Given its Class A FCC certification, the machine will be living up to its
character as a standalone all-purpose business machine or as a high-end
design and graphics workstation.&P;  The Wang PC 350/33C is an expensive buy,
even in its stripped down $5,810 version, but buyers get able performance,
expandability with guaranteed compatibility, and sturdy construction.&O;

Total Recall Contact Management Software Total Recall is more than just a
movie title; it's a mental power that anyone who uses a telephone would love
to have.&M;

Imagine this scenario: the phone rings, you pick it up, and the caller says,
"Hello, this is John Smith from XYZ Corp."&M;

Within seconds you remember every phone conversation you've ever had with Mr.&O;
Smith, his connection to your organization, his fax number, his account
balance (if he's a client), and his wife's name.&P;  Smoothly, you respond, "Hi
John.&P;  We haven't talked since you called about the Robinson project in
August.&P;  I hope that letter I sent you on September 2 helped.&P;  By the way
how's Barbara doing?"&P;  Needless to say, Mr. Smith is impressed.&M;

PIMS WITH A PURPOSE&M;

Contact management packages look (at first glance) like custom flat-file
database applications.&P;  In fact, most of these packages are built from
database languages, particularly dBASE and Clipper.&M;

Unlike the general-purpose personal information managers (PIMs) reviewed in
the November 23, 1990, issue of PC Magazine ("Order From Chaos: PIMs Tackle
Your Desktop"), the 15 contact managers evaluated here are designed
specifically to keep records of all your phone calls and client contacts.&O;
Most present a screen filled with fields for contact names, numbers,
addresses, and past conversations.&P;  Alarms and ticklers indicate when to make
calls and what to say.&P;  Calendars, which add some PIM functionally, remind
you of all the calls you need to make next Tuesday and keep track of your
appointments as well.&M;

Most packages can take the contact database and use it to print envelopes,
generate mailing labels, and produce form letters.&P;  If a fax board is present
in your PC or on your LAN, you may be able to send a fax from your desk.&O;
Desktop utilities like calculators, clocks, and expense trackers are also
typically included.&M;

FORM, FIT, AND FUNCTION&M;

While most of the contact managers evaluated here perform similar tasks such
as auto-dialing, they are differentiated by the people who use them.&O;
Heavy-duty systems like TeleMagic are designed for organizations with
intensive telemarketing operations.&P;  Typical features include data import and
export capability, capacity for an unlimited number of records and databases,
an abundant supply of predefined reports, quick shelling out to DOS to run
other applications, a robust complement of PIM functionality, expense
tracking, and customizing options.&P;  They are also available in network
versions with password security.&M;

Focused on the unique needs of telemarketing forces, both TeleMagic and the
less-powerful Eighty/20 Advanced include a function for creating scripts to
prompt telemarketers when delivering a sales pitch.&P;  This package also
includes AutoSwap for shelling to DOS while the program resides in only 10K
of RAM.&P;  Other systems, such as KeepTraX, provide easy exists to DOS, but
without some kind of memory swapping the program continues to devour enough
memory to render this function essentially useless.&M;

Another distinct group of contact management users require a different
feature set.&P;  The salesperson who relies heavily on a laptop would have
little use for the depth of a high-end solution and may opt for a system with
multipurpose breadth.&P;  This user works primarily, and independently, with
contact management software and thus would prefer a morebasic, self-contained
productivity tool--a contact organizer, phone log, appointment book, and word
processor.&M;

Here also, portability, which is the program's capability to fit its code on
one floppy disk with space to spare for contact information, is an advantage.&O;
The sacrifices are usually inconsequential--the electronic manual may need to
be removed--but essential functions, such as basic search, to-do list, client
history, and automatic rollover of unmade telephone calls or missed
appointments, are retained.&P;  For the salesperson on the road, a rigid input
format and minimal customization options can be conveniences rather than
shortcomings.&M;

Other packages emphasize functions valuable across a variety of business
environments.&P;  Act!, Version 2.0, now includes an upscale word processor and
support for 300 printers.&P;  While Integrated Sales Manager has a bare feature
set, it performs functions with admirable speed.&P;  As a general-use contact
manager, The Maximizer allows for input of comprehensive contact information
and custom searches.&M;

Contact managers are, for the most part, priced similarly to personal
information managers.&P;  The packages evaluated here range from $69.95 for the
no-frills Business Contacts and Information Manager to $795 for the
feature-rich Pursuit.&M;

UP THE ORGANIZATION&M;

It's important to consider wider solutions before you buy one of these
packages.&P;  While nine of these packages have special network versions, and
some provide multiple databases so several users can track contacts
independently on one PC, there are more-sophisticated solutions that extend
beyond the scope of this evaluation.&P;  Although these high-end, higher-cost
vertical market applications are not as ubiquitous as conatact management
software, they are dedicated to providing custom solutions and are emerging
as competition for information management.&M;

For example, there is an entire category of software referred to as
"salesforce automation."&P;  The leading package in this arena is SaleMaker
Software's SaleMaker Plus, priced at $695 for a single user version, $2,495
for a five-user LAN version, and $995 for each additional, five-user node.&O;
SaleMaker Software emphasizes the advantages of corporatewide
contact-information sharing by suggesting scenarios in which field sales reps
transmit their daily activities back to the company LAN each night and get
whatever reports they need from the corporatewide database.&M;

Sale,Maker Software also sells a corporate development system for MIS staffs
who want to customize the software.&P;  The company will also do customized
software for organizations with special needs.&M;

REAL WORLD SOLUTIONS&M;

You can also find contact management software with links to familiar
accounting packages.&P;  RealWorld Corp.'s RealWorld Sales Management Solutions
is a good example.&P;  This package can be purchased for $695, but its likely
tha most people will opt for the $1,995 network version.&P;  SMS has most of the
features you'd expect in a contact management package, but it also allows
sales managers to monitor income due, income received, and revenue.&P;  The
package's interface matches that of the RealWorld Acclounting Series, and it
ites into RealWorld's inventory, order-entry, accounts receivable, invoicing,
and job costs modules.&M;

Because of its tight integration to the RealWorld Accounting Series, we don't
evaluate the package here with the single-user contact managers.&P;  Its
excellent connections to the accounting software make it unwidely and hard to
recommend as a standalone solution when so many lowoverhead, easy-to-use
alternatives are available.&P;  As part of a complete, front-to-back sales force
automation system, however, SMS is a great addition to the widely used
RealWorld Accounting Series.&M;

Another approach is taken by SBT Corp., which is best known for its
dBASE-based accounting software.&P;  SBT offers Corporate Contact Manager, an
organization-wide contact manager that tracks all incoming and outgoing calls
and their duration, and then connects all sales activity related to the calls
directly to SBT accounting software.&P;  This $1,395 package generates call
lists based on sales information taken from accounts receivable and sales
order files, and if a fax server is available, users can send faxes directly
from their PCs.&M;

FUTURE SHOCK&M;

As communications technology improves, contact managers are destined to
become even simpler to use.&P;  You may wonder, for example, how far away we are
from systems that can identify the person calling and bring up the
appropriate sales record before you even answer the phone.&P;  Caller ID
technology, also known as automatic number identification (ANI), which is now
available in a few states (in some cases it is facing legal opposition on the
grounds of privacy rights violation), would seem to make this easy to do, but
there are obstacles.&M;

First, the concept is worthwhile only for organizations like mail-order firms
that handle mostly inbound calls.&P;  If you sell by making calls yourself,
there's no point.&P;  Second, you face the problem of having your incoming calls
identified by the PBX system of the company your client is calling from, not
by his or her personal extension.&P;  And until MCI and AT&amp;T settle on some
standards, Caller ID cannot make great leaps forward, even if the ISDN
technology that makes it all possible proliferates quickly.&M;

For the time being, you still need to pick up the phone to make and answer
your calls, and if you do that with any frequency, a good contact manager
will serve as the steel-trap memory you wish you always had.&M;

REVIEW CRITERIA&M;

The 15 contact management packages included in this round-up are evaluated as
standalone packages designed for the individual salesperson; we will review
sales-force automation packages like SaleMaker Plus and RealWord's Sales
Management Software in an upcoming issue.&P;  Although it was not required for
evaluation, most of the packages can be run from one or two floppy disks,
making them viable for those who take floppy disk-based portables on the
road.&O;

Act! Emerging from a recent facelift with faster contact lookup, an
impressive report generator, and the ability to schedule multiple calls,
meetings, and appointments, Contact Software's Act!, Version 2.0, gracefully
walks the wire between contact management simplicity and performance.&P;  The
$395 program foretells the future of contact management software.&P;  Not only
is it slick, full-featured, and economical in required keystrokes, it enables
you to shell to DOS or launch another program while holding only 10K captive.&O;
This ability actually encourages you to jump from Act! to another application
and back throughout the day.&M;

Act! 2.0 abandons the Lotus-style primary/secondary menu system of its
predecessor and debuts an easier-to-use single menu bar with pull-down
options.&P;  Though the program now supports a mouse, the keyboard controls are
still preferable.&P;  One reason is that you can set tab stops on any field for
quick, keyboard-controlled shifts around the screen.&P;  Act!'s database
displays 73 fields on two well-designed screens for each contact.&M;

UNLIMITED CALLS&M;

MENU SELECTION, data entry, and general navigation are all excellent.&P;  Pop-up
submenus abound, with more than half of the fields linked to pop-up that hold
common responses.&P;  You can customize nearly all the submenus to speed up data
entry.&P;  In most cases, manipulating Act! becomes second nature quickly, even
with extensive use of function-key combinations.&M;

Act! integrates several important tools with its contact database.&P;  The
package includes a simple word processor with spell checker, calendar, to-do
list, contact note writer, contact summary, weekly scheduler, and expense
recorder.&P;  All features are linked with the contact file and can handle many
repetitive chores, such as automatically inserting the contact's name and
address in a letter's salutation.&P;  You can schedule an unlimited number of
future calls or meetings, or list an unlimited number of tasks for each
contact.&P;  That's a major improvement over earlier versions.&M;

Telephone-related support is solid, and a timer to record the duration of
calls can be switched on and off for your billing purposes.&P;  All calls,
incoming or outgoing, are logged to the contact's activity file.&P;  You can
utilize nine predefined reports or design almost any kind of custom report
with Act!'s powerful and complex report generator.&M;

Contact Software has added an impressive list of features to Version 2.0, yet
it lacks password security and doesn't spot duplicate entries.&P;  The task list
includes calls, meetings, and to-do tasks, but would be even more valuable if
you could prioritize uncompleted tasks or automatically roll them over to the
next day.&P;  While the pop-up submenus make contact information entry fast,
there's no way to copy all, or even some, of your entry to another entry in
your client files.&M;

ONE TO BEAT&M;

Few contact managers come close to Act!'s depth or breadth.&P;  You can boot
Act! at 8:00 A.M.&P;  and remain within until 5:00 P.M., all the while handling
calls, writing letters, and taking notes.&P;  When you need your spreadsheet or
full-featured word processor, you can easily drop out of Act! and return to
it quickly.&P;  Its database search, though much improved and considerably
faster and more efficient than before, still doesn't match The Maximizer's
speed.&P;  Act! is an excellent contact manager both for sales and nonsales use,
but it lacks the telemarketing features that phone-intensive salespeople may
require.&M;

Nevertheless, the jump to Version 2.0 puts Act! ahead of most of the
competition.&P;  Act! is one of the most powerful general contact managers
available--in great part due to its generous feature list and minimal
keystrokes required for most tasks.&P;  Act! works better in a nonsales capacity
than any other contact manager, and therefore has the best potential to help
push contact management farther into the software mainstream.&O;

Action Plus With the ability to attach up to 50 different graphic images to
each one of its detailed contact screens.&P;  Action Plus Software's Action
Plus, Version 4.2, is a unique contact manager.&P;  The $495 package is at its
most impressive when running on a desktop PC, but it will run on a laptop if
you sacrifice the on-line help, the on-line users manual, and the satellite
module that allows tranfer of records from one Action Plus system to another
Attaching anything that can be scanned and/or saved as a .PCX file to a
contact record gives the telemarker the ability to see and describe the items
in inventory.&M;

If you have the discipline to update the many detailed and data-orinted fiels
of each contract record, you will be rewarded with a clear and concise report
of any transaction, contractual agreements,  phone call, or letter that may
have transpired.&P;  By utilizing specific entries, such as ID numbers and a
code space with which you could tag profiles specifically as "Wid-gets" or
"California," you can minimize the time needed to search through your
database.&P;  Another helpful feature is the space for contact gender,
especially useful when you deal with unisex names like Terry or Pat.&M;

The screens are packed with information relating to your contact: name,
company, address, position, first and last dates of communication, notes,
sales commission and contract status, ID numbers, tax ID, code, and phone
number entries that can be customized up to ten digits.&P;  At first it seems a
bit overwhelming to have so much on screen at once, but any saleperson will
value the comprehensiveness.&M;

Functions such as Add, Delete, Find, and List are executed with first-letter
keystrokes, function keys, or cursor placement.&M;

SEARCHING WITH SPEED&M;

When speed is essential, Action Plus offers two ways to pull up a profile:
Quick Search, which lets you search only by last name or company, or Complex
Search, which opens a blank contact record and lets you fill in as much
criteria as you want.&P;  The more specific you are, the quicker you'll find the
desired record.&M;

The calendar functions as a daily planner and accepts entries as appointments
or to-do tasks.&P;  Meetings are displayed graphically as a bar that extends
over a fixed time line running from 7 A.M.&P;  to 8 P.M.&P;  across the bottom of
the screen.&P;  When attempting to schedule conflicting or overlapping meetings,
Action Plus warns you and will accept the conflict, changing the color of
portion of the bar to illustrate the length of each meeting.&M;

The expense report feature is another convenience for the salesperson on the
move.&P;  Odometer readings can be calculated within this field at an adjustable
expense, rate, and total billable hours to a client can be added up and
printed with the appropriate names and dates.&M;

WHAT'S MISSING?&M;

With five viewing fields, a free-form notepad, a calendar, 20 different
telemarketing scripts and form letters, invoices and report generators,
expense and appointment records, and the ability to log 99 million profiles
and 1 billion items in inventory, Action Plus is fairly complete.&P;  But it is
by no means perfect.&M;

The package is a memory hog, rendering the exit-to-DOS function basically
useless.&P;  Action Plus is not a TSR, so when the phone rings you need to load
it in order to view the appropriate profile.&P;  It also lacks a calculator.&M;

The advantages of Action Plus center around its detailed contact records and
its ability to attach images.&P;  Like other contact managers, it requires a
commitment from you to update the database.&P;  Although what is sacrificed
through commitment is returned in speed--when speed really counts.&O;

<SUMMARY>Creagh Computer Systems Inc's $175 Biz*Base Gold 1.1 has several
useful features, but it lacks consistency and polish compared to
the other reviewed packages.&P;  Biz*Base's character-based user

are difficult to learn and remember.&P;  The context-sensitive help
feature does not always provide useful information, and the manual
is poorly organized, typed and indexed.&P;  Users must use printer
Escape codes because printer support is not included.&P;  Data in
dBase form can be imported into Biz*Base fields, although data in
fixed-length format or separated by commas must be in precise
Biz*Base format.&P;  Although the package includes a calculator,
scheduling and alarm features, it lacks many features and its

Biz*Base Gold A bsic part of microcomputer software lore is the story of the
end user who developed a program that others wanted to use, so the author
published it and sold lots of copies.&P;  Biz*Base Gold is an example of this
"kitchen table" software success story.&P;  With a list price of $175 and a
complete list of features, the program from Creagh Computer Systems looks
like an attractive value.&P;  Unfortunately, its apparent strengths do not hold
up to closer scrutiny.&M;

Developed from Clipper and other dBASE-related tools, Biz*Base Gold shows
many tell-tale signs of evolutionary growth and inconsistent execution of
design strategy.&M;

THE LOOK AND FEEL&M;

The character-based text screens are attractive, and the color choices for
displays are reasonable.&P;  You can alter the heading for just about every
field, giving you the flexibility to alter the appearance of the stored data.&O;
There are seven character fields, six date fields, six numeric fields, and
six logical fields that are intended for user-definable information and
provide plenty of flexibility.&P;  Since you can define additional indexes for
database searching and reporting, you have added flexibility.&M;

There is also context-sensitive on-line help.&P;  If the program is unable to
decipher the information you need, it presents a windowed index of help
topics and you can choose the one you want.&P;  Here is where the frayed edges
start to appear.&P;  The help screens are limited in content, and some topics,
such as printer setup strings, are missing entirely.&P;  Some help screens only
provide a sales pitch for other products from the publisher, such as the
collection of canned mail-merge letters.&P;  (The sample mail-merge letters
provided with the program start with a header that spells out the deal as
well.)&M;

THE CHALLENGES&M;

Turn to the manual for support, and you are thwarted again.&P;  The index does
not provide entries for fundamental items such as "Printer" of "Envelopes."&O;
The manual is primarily a loose mixture of tutorial and reference.&P;  There are
typos, words that run together without spaces, and the useful information in
the documentation is often difficult to find.&M;

The user interface provides additional challenges.&P;  There are many function
keys active at a given time, but only some are listed at the bottom of the
screen.&P;  Some assignments are not intuitive; to create a letter for the
record on screen, you don't select "Correspondence," but instead use "Forms."&O;
A function-key template and a pop-up reference window help you remember the
assignments, but you'll need the manual to keep track of the options.&P;  And
when you use the Escape key to back out of an operation, you are often
returned back to the top level rather than the prior step.&P;  This means a lot
of repeated work when you select the wrong report of label format, and
getting dumped back to the program's opening screen.&M;

There is no built-in support for printers.&P;  Instead, you are directed to
study your printer manual so you can enter the correct Escape sequences.&O;
This is all well and good, but it means that the program's word processor
won't space your 10-point Times Roman laser font correctly.&M;

One bright point, however, is data import.&P;  Provide that you have your data
in a dBASE-compatible format, you can assign fields one by one to match up
with the corresponding Biz*Base format.&P;  On the other hand, if you only have
a comma-delimited or fixed-length format, the data must match the Biz*Base
format precisely.&P;  Unfortunately, the manual does not entirely explain the
complexities of this task.&M;

HELP ON THE WAY&M;

According to a company representative, Creagh Computers Systems was a month
away from releasing Version 2 of Biz*Base at the time of this review.&P;  The
new version is reportedly a complete overhaul of Version 1.1, with more
features, new file structures, and new documentation.&M;

The version of Biz*Base Gold tested here has some sophisticated scheduling
and to-do list features and offers suitable extras, such as a pop-up
calculator, spell checking, time and date stamping, and alarms.&P;  If there
were no other programs available in this category, it would be a treasure
because you certainly can do a lot of useful work with it.&P;  The problem is
that it is so uneven and is missing so many important features that it does
not hold up in comparison with the competition.&O;

Business Contacts and Information Manager For the uninitiated user of contact
management software, functional simplicity is a strong advantage and one
that's the core of Business Contacts and Information Manager, Version 1.1,
sold by Disk-Count Software for $69.95.&P;  Yes, $69.95.&M;

The price you pay for ease of use is limited options and some awkward
compromises that more-robust and costly packages overcome.&P;  BCIM is not an
ambitious package, yet should satisfy the expectations of the entry-level
user and buyers resisting steep prices.&M;

As a modified knockoff of Eighty/20 Software's Expeed, BCIM users receive an
attractive upgrade policy to Eighty/20's line of contact managers.&P;  You can
convert your data automatically to these more-powerful packages, which
include expense tracking, statistical data, multiple databases, and data
import and export.&P;  BCIM's built-in obsolescence positions Eighty/20 products
in Disk-Count Software's wide retail distribution stream.&M;

BCIM can do essentially what other contact managers do--replace your Rolodex,
to-do list, calendar, and even function as a simple personal information
manager.&P;  Version 1.&P;  condenses the program's code from three to one floppy
disk for easy installation on a laptop, enabling you to tote your office
everywhere.&P;  The Start-Up Guide takes you step-by-step through BCIM using a
dummy list of contacts, memos, and letters, so you probably won't need to
print the 100-page manual that's supplied only on disk.&M;

SIMPLE SCREENS&M;

The screen architecture is only a few levels deep with four main-menu
choices: Daily Schedule Update, Client Access Menu, Maintenance Menu, and
Report Menu.&P;  The bottom rw of 15 selections quickly allows you to edit,
print, display a schedule, or type a letter.&P;  A handful of hot keys access
context-sensitive help, a notepad, and monthly calendar.&P;  Most daily work is
oriented around the Client Profile screen--a screen that accesses every bit
of information you've stored about clients, including company and contact
name, address, phone numbers, and notes, as well as ten user-defined
descriptors.&P;  You can conveniently add contact names to a company already on
the system without retyping repetitive information.&M;

The rather rigid design of the Client Profile screen prohibits city names
longer than 15 characters, and the ZIP code format can't be modified for
Canadian codes, such as M4V 2Z5.&P;  There is space for two 10-digit telephone
numbers, but you can't identify them with specific labels indicating fax,
extension, or e-mail.&M;

From the Client Access menu you can launch searches as well as edit, shuffle,
and sort your stack of Rolodex cards.&P;  There's also an auto-dialer,
mail-merge facilities, a skeletal word processor, an assortment of
customizable business letters, and ten generic reports that offer a moderate
customization.&P;  For a low-end package, the printing formats are sufficient,
including 2-by 4-inch and 3- by 5-inch Rolodex cards, 1- and 2-column
formats, envelopes, and labels.&M;

One of the more-convenient viewing features is the Daily Update of Schedule
Dates, which reminds you of all the phone calls, meetings, and letters you've
neglected.&P;  You can also view a schedule for each client; a group of clients
by filter; a monthly calendar; a daily schedule; and a history of each
client.&M;

There are ten customizable descriptors that use three-letter abbreviations to
further identify clients and two search methods.&P;  Using the "By Example"
approach, you identify specific criteria and send the system on a search of
all clients that match the filter, The "By Sub-Group" approach saves filters
and expedites tasks such as printing and reporting.&M;

THE FUNCTIONALITY TRADE-OFF&M;

One particularly irksome limitation forces you to attach all appointments to
a particular client.&P;  To schedule a holiday, you must first enter it on a
Client Profile screen.&P;  The date will then be posted directly to the monthly
calendar, and the holiday will appear in your list of clients, a rather
compromising solution.&M;

Other limitations are: a monthly calendar that fits only two lines of ten
characters per day.&P;  There is no warning that you've scheduled conflicting
meetings, so you can plan two or more meetings that start at the same time.&O;
You're also restricted to one database, which prohibits extensive
customization.&P;  One final trade-off is BCIM's lack of integration.&P;  There are
three locations to jot a memo of any length, but you may forget exactly where
you stored it.&P;  Lacking text retrieval capability, the system leaves you to
hunt down the memo yourself.&M;

With a rock bottoms price tag, BCIM is a back-to-basics package that provides
just enough power to turn an unruly list of client names and information into
a useful database to help you communicate more effectively with your clients,
customers, and sales prospects.&O;

<SUMMARY>Eighty/20 Software Inc's $395 Eighty/20 Advanced 2.23 personal
information management system is an average package distinguished
only by its complex script-building features.&P;  Eighty/20 uses
dBase III data files, but the file structure is not documented,
and data import and export requires printing reports to disk.&O;
Contact name fields include first and last names, so searching
based solely on last names is not as simple as it should be.&P;  Word
processing features and font support are limited, but the
program's call-scripting features allow users to develop branched
scripts that record client responses at each decision point.&P;  The
documentation is inelegant but useful and well-indexed, and the
program itself can fit on two 1.2Mbyte or 1.44Mbyte floppy disks.&M;

Eighty/20 Advanced The old time-management adage teaches us that a 20-percent
investment in planning will yield an 80-percent reduction in the amount of
time it takes to complete a job.&P;  Eighty/20 Advanced, a $395 package from
Eighty/20 Software, aims to save you time and effort, whether you are in
sales or not.&M;

Eighty/20 comes with the features you expect to find in a contact manager and
uses a text-based interface (a bit cluttered at times) to display them.&O;
There is a batch of six user-defined fields that reside on a secondary
screen, and it is not immediately obvious that they exist or how to find
them.&M;

CONVENIENT FEATURE SET&M;

Features include the typical phone dialing (only two phone numbers per
contract) and mail-merge functions.&P;  You can schedule events and keep notes
on the activities.&P;  There are even appealing extras such as expense tracking
and lookup tables for data entry, with context-sensitive help available for
many screens.&P;  The program makes it easy to maintain a history of past
actions.&M;

There are some unusual features as well.&P;  For people involved in sales or
research calls, there is a sophisticated call-scripting feature.&P;  Some
programs can pop-up a list of common questions and show you the responses,
but Eighty/20 goes much further.&P;  You can build complex branching scripts,
and the program will record the answers and choices taken at each juncture.&O;
Not only that, but the program will even time the length of the call so you
can track how long the interviews are taking on average.&M;

You also get automatic look-up of city and state based on ZIP codes--only a
few ZIP codes are loaded when you first get the program, but the list grows
automatically as you add new database records.&M;

STRUCTURAL SHORTCOMINGS&M;

Based on Clipper code, Eighty/20 uses dBASE III data files.&P;  While this might
seem to be an advantage, it is not.&P;  Not only does Eighty/20 Software not
include any documentationof the file structure, there is no data import or
export facility aside from printing a report to disk.&P;  If you want to move
your data around, you need to get the Data Conversion Utility, a $50 option.&M;

One curious fact about the file structure is that there are not separate
fields for first and last names for each contract.&P;  As a result, you cannot
search for a person by their last name except by searching within the entire
name field.&P;  There is a "Salutation" field that can be used for first names,
but in some cases you will want to address someone more formally with a title
and last name, so you can't count on using this as a first name field.&M;

The weakest parts of Eighty/20 are the user interface and the printer
support.&P;  The program does support a variety of printers, including laser
printers, but the font support is primitive and the word processing features
are spartan at best.&P;  The output is more convenient than a typewriter, but
you'll have to forego the use of proportional fonts or other fancy formatting
that you expect from most word processors.&M;

The documentation is hefty and a bit ponderous in its style, but it is
thoroughly indexed and serves well as a reference.&P;  The program is sleek
enough to fit on a pair of 3.5-inch floppy disks (or a pair of high-density
5.25-inch disks) which makes it possible to run on most portables.&M;

Eighty/20 is an adequate performer, but the lack of built-in import and
export features and the small number of fields offered make it less
attractive than some competitors.&P;  The call-scripting feature is perhaps its
most distinguishing feature.&P;  Unless this is a swing factor in your decision,
you will probably do better with something else.&O;

<SUMMARY>Dilworth Software Inc's $199 Instant-Office 3.93 personal
information management system is uneven because the package has
been updated so frequently, but it has many useful features.&O;
Instant-Office's best feature is its ability to work with outside
word processors.&P;  When word processing is required, the
Instant-Office shells to DOS and calls the word processing
software with the client's record document.&P;  One drawback of this
method is that the list of tasks to be done must be manually
updated from the word processor.&P;  Instant-Office does not include
a calendar.&P;  The user interface changes from function to function,
and many of the screens and controls are poorly designed.&P;  The
program has two known bugs that Dilworth Software says will be
fixed.&P;  The program can fit on one 1.2Mbyte floppy disk, and it
supports many facsimile boards.&M;

Instant-Office Instant-Office from Dilworth Software is a $199 program that
helps you manage names, addresses, correspondence, telephone calls,
appointments, and more.&P;  This package also poses a challenge to a reviewer
because it contains a mixture of features that vary greatly in their utility
and quality of implementation.&M;

Part of this inner conflict arises from the way the program is developed.&O;
The publisher issues frequent updates, primarily to add new functions, but
these often result in changes in the way the program operates.&P;  A quote from
the second page of the manual says it all: Since the program is updated more
frequently than the manual, if you find a conflict in the directions, believe
the screen before you believe this manual.&M;

One problem with this disclaimer is that not everything appears on the
screen.&P;  Many features are hidden, such as the four-function calculator
available in the data-entry screen; the only place to find it mentioned is in
the context-sensitive help screen.&M;

On the other hand, the program is filled with brilliant touches.&P;  The most
fundamental feature is its word processor--it has none.&P;  Rather than require
you to give up your favorite word processor, it is designed to use any one of
several major word processors as a seamless part of the program: WordPerfect,
WordStar, XyWrite, Volkswriter, Microsoft Word, Nota Bene, Professional
Write, QS, and NewWord.&P;  Limited support is provided for a handful of other
programs.&M;

The way this work is simple.&P;  Whenever you need to use a word processor,
Instant-Office shells out to DOS and unloads most of itself from memory and
then calss your word processor.&P;  If you're taking notes on a client, it calls
up a document that is linked to that client's record.&P;  This gives you
unlimited capacity for notes, plus all the search, formatting, and macro
facilities offered by the word processor.&P;  Or you can call up a client's data
screen, press three keys, and your word processor will load with a letter
already started--date, name, addresses, salutation, and a closing signature
block with your name.&P;  If you want, you can even create a letterhead file
with your word processor that will be merged automatically when the letter is
created.&M;

This approach does have its limitations, however.&P;  For example,
Instant-Office uses your word processor to maintain a to-do list.&P;  Unlike
other programs where this list is automatically updated with information from
each individual contact record, Instant-Office requires that you keep to-do
tasks in a static word processing document.&M;

There are other limitations.&P;  You can only schedule one event per contact,
although the latest version of the program makes this far easier than it was
in prior versions.&P;  There is no calendar--you can get a list of events
scheduled for a day, or a range of days (the default is a week starting with
today).&P;  There are many useful reports, with lots of variations and options,
but there is no free-form report facility.&P;  (There is an optional Query
module for $150 that provides more reporting power.)&P;  There are no
user-defined fields.&M;

INCONSISTENT INTERFACE&M;

The program interface is not consistent between functions.&P;  There is a moving
light bar on the first screen of the main menu, but not the second.&P;  The data
entry screen is crowded, and cursor movements are not intuitive.&P;  The program
was developed using DataFlex and is generally reliable and robust, but the
excellent data import module is flawed by a bug that allows you to
consistently crash it.&P;  And another bug causes the program to lose track of a
contact's note file if the person's last name changes.&P;  According to a
company representative, these problems will be fixed in a future upgrade.&M;

But there is also much to love about this package.&P;  It is arguably the
easiest one to use for one-time letters, and it makes envelope and label
printing a snap, even one at a time on a laser printer.&P;  It can fit on a
single high-density floppy disk (although the company recommends that you use
a hard disk) so it can be used with a notebook computer.&P;  It recognizes calls
within your area code, toll calls, and calls that require a "1-" prefix.&P;  You
can duplicate one contact record to create a new one for someone else in the
same company.&P;  The category field provides simple but powerful and flexible
search facilities.&P;  There is comprehensive fax board support.&P;  And you get to
use the word processor you already know, which means you can use all its font
and formatting features to produce attractive letters.&M;

In the end, you must decide for or against Instant-Office based on your needs
and tastes.&P;  It is missing some sophisticated features offered by more
expensive programs, and covers the basic features with an uneven interface.&O;
It is ideal for use with lasers, printing all sorts of labels and envelopes
with ease.&P;  And the power offered by integrating your existing word processor
saves you money and training time, while giving you the best output quality
of any package in this group.&O;

Integrated Sales Manager Integrated Sales Manager from ASELCO is a fast,
no-frills contact manager that tries to automate sales and telemarketing
chores.&P;  ISM's great advantage is speed; it plows through large numbers of
contacts with a RAM-based contact list.&P;  This package cost$495 and is the
best choice for portable-equipped sales staffs who are just beginning to
benefit from a down-and-dirty, information-in, information-out alternative to
a Day Timer.&P;  Its bare-bones approach makes it a natural to first-time
computer users.&M;

ISM's interface provides seven selections across a single menu bar: Database,
Calendar, Things, Report, Features, Back-Up, and Program.&P;  The menus pop down
like those in Microsoft Windows, and submenus overlap previous windows or
appear to the side.&P;  You won't have any problem moving through ISM's screens,
although the program lacks important keyboard extras.&P;  For instance, there's
no way to get to the last field on a contact screen without repeatedly
hitting a cursor or Enter Key.&P;  A contact spans three sparse screens that
hold little more than the basics: company name, address, phone number, two
contacts, and some sales-related data that can be customized.&M;

TOO MUCH MISSING&M;

You'll find traditional and unusual supporting features in ISM.&P;  The
calendar, expense tracker, and memo writer are solid--not flashy.&P;  The alarm
feature works only within the program, and its quirks may stump you at first.&O;
Built-in invoice and quotation writers are useful if they are part of your
job, but these features will probably be ignored otherwise.&P;  Though the
contact database puts meager screens on the monitor, you can easily organize
and reorganize your contacts.&P;  Selecting a list of contacts that meet your
criteria from a maximum of 1,500 held in RAM is fast and simple.&P;  From there
you can pigeonhole contacts by groups or database, a termISM uses to describe
a user-defined subsection of the contact list.&M;

One of ISM's brightest spots is the Sales Call feature.&P;  This tool lets you
record calls and summarize the phone pitch via a custom response list.&P;  It's
perfect for guiding you through an over-the-phone sales presentation.&M;

Stripped down as it is, ISM is missing more than it offers.&P;  Don't expect
data import or export, on-line help, or even user-defined reports.&P;  You'll
use ISM's memo writer only as a word processor of last resort.&P;  It doesn'r
insert the contact name and address, and it handles only the most elementary
editing and formatting.&P;  You can't write a contact note longer than 781
characters and only one phone number can be auto-dialed per contact.&P;  Add a
stronger appointment calendar and a new to-do list, toss the
invoice/quotation features, and Integrated Sales Manager would fare better
against the competition.&P;  But nothing's going to help until the anemic
contact database gets more screens, more fields, and more features.&M;

FAST AND SINGLED-MINDED&M;

Comparisons with other contact managers highlight ISM's deficiencies even
more.&P;  Although ISM shares strong list management traits with packages such
as The Maximizer, it's simply not in the same league.&P;  Telemarketers will
want to head for beefier programs and nonsales users will find little value
here.&M;

Strangely enough, the lack of features is ISM's strongest suit.&P;  Salespeople
who think a package like Act! is too much to handle may appreciate ISM's
back-to-basics approach.&P;  Sales-specific features, such as the customizable
call response list, pinpoint the audience ISM is trying to reach.&P;  Fast
though it is (and it is very fast), ISM is so set on courting the first-time
computer user that it pales in comparison with programs that cost $100-$200
less.&M;

Salespeople with limited contact information needs or those spooked by
feature-rich programs and large manuals may appreciate ISM's many
sales-specific features.&P;  However, if you're not in sales or if you expect
much more than a simple database, ISM' not for you.&P;  Too many important
supporting features are absent.&P;  Look at ISM only if you keep the most basic
contact information in your quest for the top prospect and the easy sale.&O;

KeepTraX KeepTaX, a contact manager from O.T.&P;  Software, was designed for the
telephone-based salesperson and no one else.&P;  Data fields are set in stone,
features tend to veer toward simplicity, and the company's definition of
state-of-the-art is somewhat behind the times.&M;

KeepTraX is equalled by other packages in its general price range, and is far
surpassed by programs in the $300 to $400 range (such as The Maximizer).&O;
Still, KeepTraX shows flashes of potential, and users who can live with its
limitations may want to take a look.&M;

CREATING FILE FOLDERS&M;

KeepTraX stores data in a two-screen format called a file-folder.&P;  The main
screen displays general information (name, phone number, address, title, name
of spouse, date of last call, and so on) concerning a specific client or
contact.&P;  The second screen consists of a comment field.&P;  All file-folders
are stored in a single database, and the program will alert you when a
duplicate record is entered.&P;  While the package allows for quick exits to
DOS, you won't be able to do much there.&P;  KeepTraX is not a TSR and uses 512K
RAM.&P;  Users working on 640K systems will find they have to quit KeepTraX
entirely to run a second application.&M;

The KeepTraX interface is colorful and easy to use.&P;  Two forms of on-line
help are provided (General and Detailed) and help screens can be customized.&O;
Command options are displayed at all times, so there is never any confusion
over which buttom to press.&M;

The package also offers a notepad, an appointment scheduler, a calculator,
and an important-dates database (to store birthdays and anniversaries).&O;
While all of these features are simple to use and are accessible by a single
keystroke, each one is remarkable only for its unremarkableness.&M;

The calculator is limited to the four basic arithmetic operations; the
notepad can hold, at most, three lines of text per note; and the appointment
scheduler has only rudimentary search capabilities--you can search
appointments bydate, month, or year, but not by name.&P;  You can search for all
meetings scheduled for October, but not for all meetings scheduled with Bob
Smith.&P;  When you're on the phone with Bob Smith, this can be a drawback.&M;

A TOUGH WORKOUT&M;

The overwhelming problem with KeepTraX, however, is its rigid design.&P;  The
data fields in the file-folders have been set by O.T.&P;  Software and cannot be
changed.&P;  This is fine as long as you wish to store the same information O.T.&O;
thinks you want to store.&P;  If you don't, you're out of luck.&M;

On the other hand, if you can live with this limitation, you'll find that
KeepTraX is not without its strong points.&P;  A filter function allows you to
create your own search criteria using Boolean logic.&P;  Onscreen menus lead the
way, so it's simple to use, and you can use the filter to create complex
search criteria.&M;

For example, if you want to search for every contact in the database who is a
vice president, you select "title" as the ield to search, "contains" as the
comparison type, and "VP" as the value for comparison.&P;  In this way, KeepTraX
will search for every file-folder that contains the term VP in the title
field.&P;  The resulting set will include folders for Executive VPs, Senior VPs,
and VPs of Engineering.&P;  This is by far the package's most-powerful feature.&M;

Other features are useful but not spectacular.&P;  KeepTraX will also allow you
to view contacts in column format.&P;  Up to 21 contacts can be viewed onscreen
at one time, and for each contact, all 52 data fields can be accessed via the
scroll keys.&P;  The package will also output information or labels to your
printer.&P;  Here KeepTraX is flexible: you choose the information to be printed
and how it should be grouped on the page (although you are still limited to
those strict data fields).&P;  A recall function allows the retrieval of erased
(but not permanently deleted) records, and a Pack command expunges data for
all time.&P;  Appointments and notes can be archived to a floppy disk and
retrieved at a later time to save hard disk space.&P;  An on-board text editor
is also provided, but don't look for any mail-merge features.&M;

KeepTraX can also read data created in other packages.&P;  The program can
import .DBF, fixed-length ASCII, and variable-length ASCII files.&P;  On our
tests, we encountered one small problem when importing .DBF files: some data
was lost when an imported field was longer than its corresponding KeepTraX
field.&M;

There are contact managers far more flexible than KeepTraX, and its desktop
utilities could use beefing up.&P;  Like a minor-league baseball player,
KeepTraX shows signs of potential, but it's still not ready for the majors.&O;

The Maximizer The Maximizer integrates an impressive set of sales and contact
tools with a database that can file an unlimited number of clients, contacts,
and alternative phone numbers under any single organization.&P;  This $295
program from Richmond Software works fast, whether it's opening
client-information windows or searching for a specific contact, and lets you
customize sublists of all kinds from the contact database.&P;  The Maximizer
serves remarkably well as a salesperson's primary application.&M;

You navigate through the sometimes complex functions via hierarchical pop-up
menus.&P;  Information can get buried beneath several menu levels, but reaching
a client takes just four keystrokes.&P;  The pop-up screens are clean and
uncluttered.&P;  Major credit goes to the secondary windows that underlie the
clients screens and contain additional contacts, important dates, and notes.&O;
Fields in the contact windows range from the standard name and addresses to a
maximum of four phone numbers, and you can easily change any field name.&P;  The
Maximizer's interface is simple to use and quickly guides you to the contact
you want.&P;  However, the program doesn't make use of a mouse.&M;

AUTOMATIC TO-DO LIST&M;

The Maximizer's client/contact database structure lets you group as many
contacts under a single client as you want.&P;  In Maximizer parlance, a client
is an organization, company, or department, while a contact is one individual
in that organization.&P;  It's perfect when you have multiple contacts at one
company and want to trace the contact history for each one separately.&M;

The program also includes the standard telephone support--auto-dialing,
automatic phone log, and timer--as well as a minimal word processor for
correspondence, a flexible daily calendar, a diary, and basic income/expense
entry.&P;  One feature of special interest is The Maximizer's Hotlist, which
automatically combines all Next Contact dates with the names and entries from
the defined range of your day-at-a-glance calendar entries to create a super
to-do list.&M;

Although The Mazimizer covers the basics, and much more, it lacks minor
features such as appointment alarm and a single-screen summary of actions and
results for each contact.&P;  In The Maximizer, you must switch between two
windows to seee the complete details of your dealings with a contact.&O;
Although you can organize the database in an almost limitless number of ways,
you're restricted to the one database.&P;  This prevents you from developing
smaller, more-focused contact lists for specific and perhaps temporary tasks.&O;
It also makes it difficult for a small sales staff to comfortably share one
Maximizer-equipped computer.&M;

Database import and export is also limited.&P;  Only ASCII files in
comma-delimited format can be imported.&P;  It takes two export/import cycles to
merge two Maximizer databases, and even then things such as the accompanying
notes are not carried over.&M;

BROAD-BASED APPEAL&M;

The Maximizer looks good regardless of the contact manager you compare it
with.&P;  It's not as keystroke savvy as Act!, and it doesn't offer as many
pop-up lists to speed data entry, but its automatic Hotlist greatly
simplifies to-do list compilation.&P;  There's no dedicated telemarketing script
feature like the one found in TeleMagic, but the general phone support,
including auto-dialing and automatic call logging, is good.&P;  The Maximizer's
macro creation is another unusual and welcome addition to the contact
management arena.&M;

The Maximizer's simple operation will appeal to phone-bound salespeople who
don't need distractions from their software.&P;  Nonsales users who work with a
large number of contacts or need to track multiple contacts within an
organization will appreciate The Maximizer's speed and capacity for unlimited
contacts.&P;  The Maximizer is a well-rounded program, one that satisfies every
major contact management need.&O;

Pro$ell Promoted at the program "for sales professionals on the move."&O;
Pro$ell from Sales Management Systems is tightly focused on the needs of the
traveling salesperson.&P;  As you would expect, this direction limits the
program's usefulness for other applications.&P;  Pro$ell, Version 1.9, would be
a poor choice for telemarketing or fund raising, but at $149 per user and
with site licenses available, the program does a good job of serving the
salesperson on the go.&M;

Sales Management Systems has designed Pro$ell for use at odd moments
throughout the day--in a car between appointments, for example.&P;  It is easy
to learn and use, with menus and data-entry screens that are largely
self-explanatory.&P;  The choices on the main menu include Setup, Client Files,
Sales Reports, Expense Entries and Reports, Utilities, Mailing Lists,
Reports, and Labels.&P;  You make a selection by typing the first letter of the
menu choice or highlighting the choice and hitting Enter.&M;

The fully descriptive menu choices make the program's internal logic clear,
so that even a newcomer can find any feature.&P;  There is no on-screen help,
but there is also little need for it.&P;  The manual is notable for being short,
well-written, and to the point.&M;

INDEPENDENT DATABASES&M;

Not surprisingly, you'll find some features that are of particular interest
for outside sales: expense tracking, a report for listing clients by steet
within a ZIP code, and fields that show hours of operation for each day of
the week.&M;

Pro$ell's focus is emphasized by the way it handles sales territories.&P;  It
allows up to 100 databases, with each database consisting of one territory.&O;
Except for a feature that lets you reassign a contact recrod to a different
territory, these databases are independent.&P;  The benefit here is that each
salesperson can maintain a territory database on a portable computer while on
the road.&P;  A sales manager can then update a system simply by copying the
latest files from any sales person's computer.&P;  The drawback is that there is
no way to produce reports that include more than one territory.&M;

Given the reality that hard disks are not yet prevalent in portable systems,
Sales Management Systems has wisely chosen to keep the program's size down to
a minimum.&P;  Unlike programs such as Tele-Magic, which uses about 1MB of disk
space, Pro$ell easily fits onto one 720K floppy disk with about 310K to
spare.&P;  According to the manual, a system with one 720K floppy disk drive
will have room for about 350 client records.&P;  A system with two 720K floppy
disk drives will have room for about 500.&M;

IMPROVEMENTS TO COME&M;

Pro$ell has some notable limitations.&P;  As shipped, the client record has room
for only three contact names and two phone numbers, and it isn't
customizable.&P;  The client screen comes with about 20 fields, eight of which
allow you to change the name.&P;  There is no way to add more fields.&M;

Other limitations show up in the text editor, which lacks basic functions
like block move, and in the mail-merge feature it's limited to inserting the
address and salutation.&P;  Finally, the notes feature has a date stamp with no
time stamp and allows only one line of text for each note.&P;  The export
feature is limited to generating CSV format files for mail-merge with a word
processor.&P;  Import, which is also limited to CSV format, is a $45 option.&M;

Extras, such as an appointment calendar, phone dialer, and password security
are missing.&P;  According to Sales Management Systems, a calendar, phone
dialer, additional fields, improved text editor, a hotkey to DOS, and
multiline notes with a time stamp will be added in the upcoming Pro$ell Plus.&O;
This version became available in October, but was released too late for
evaluation here.&P;  Pro$ell Pluss will also be available in a $495
network-based version called Pro$ell LAN.&M;

Pro$ell is best described as a minimalist package that includes features
sufficient in most cases.&P;  If your organization has the luxury of portable
PCs equipped with hard disk drives, you'll want to look elsewhere.&P;  But as a
tool to help sales-people keep track of contacts on floppy disk-based
portables, Pro$ell is a very good choice.&O;

Pursuit Pursuit, Version 2.2, from Information Management Consultants can
function as a standard contact manager but is best described as an automated
marketing package.&P;  The package's strongest point is its ability to define
and follow a marketing campaign.&P;  Pursuit was written as a run-time
application in DataFlex, a relational database program, and is priced at $795
for the single-user DOS version ($1,895 for the Novell network version and
$2,895 for the Xenix version).&M;

MARKETING FOCUS&M;

To automate a marketing campaign in Pursuit, you first create one or more
marketing paths.&P;  When you start a contact on a given path, Pursuit will
automatically schedule form letters, brochure mailings, follow-up phone
calls, and even faxes if you have the fax option.&P;  This not only saves you
the chore of manual scheduling, it ensures that nothing will get overlooked.&M;

Another notable strenght is customization flexibility.&P;  As shipped, the
program comes with about 40 fields, including those that a marketing
operation will most likely use.&P;  If you need more, you can create a second
data-entry screen with up to 15 fields and index any eight for sorts and
searches.&P;  You can also create a personalized help system with answers to
common questions from customers.&P;  Pursuit comes with more than 50 predefined
reports, as well as a sophisticated query function that will let you define
custom reports as needed.&P;  The number of reports you can save is limited only
by disk space.&M;

Other features include a calendar, autodealer, and full-featured word
processor.&P;  The month-at-a-glance calendar is notable for its tight
integration with the contact tracking function.&P;  You can view a detail list
for any given day, change the date or time for any item on the list and the
change will automatically appear in the contact record.&P;  Although there is no
actual to-do list screen, the calendar detail list effectively provides you
with one.&M;

For sophisticated mail-merging, Pursuit will export data files in Microsoft
Word, WordPerfect, MultiMate, or WordStar format.&P;  The package includes a
word processing program called DWP, which is actually NewWord, a WordStar
twin.&P;  As shipped, Pursuit will only import CSV or CR/LF format files, but
Information Management Consultants say that import modules for any other
format will be provided on request at no charge, even if the company has to
write the module from scratch.&M;

STRUCTURAL SHORTCOMINGS&M;

As strong as Pursuit is on features, it is notably weak on ease of learninng
and ease of use.&P;  With the exception of a few pop-up boxes, the program has a
look and feel that harkens back to the early days of PCs.&P;  The menu format
presents numbered lists with an overwhelming 24 choices on a single screen
and 11 choices on the main menu.&P;  You choose options by typing a number or by
highlighting a choice with arrow keys and striking Enter.&M;

Another disadvantage of the menus is thay they lack a logically consistent,
self-explanatory structure.&P;  For example, three of the choices on the main
menu are Account Follow-up, Maintain Accounts, and Account Maintenance, all
of which could mean the same thing.&P;  Too often, you'll have to search through
the menus to find the options you want.&M;

Other shorcomings include a poorly organized manual and weak on-line help.&O;
Information Management Consultants states that since most people don't read
manuals, "we provide perfect support rather than perfect manuals."&P;  And
indeed, if you call the technical support line, the company will train you
for free.&P;  However, support is only available from 8 A.M.&P;  to 5 P.M.&P;  Central
Time, and you have to pay for the call.&M;

Pursuit is a mixed bag, strong on functionality.&P;  However, if you want a
basic contact management package you can learn with minimum fuss and bother,
you'll certainly want to look elsewhere.&P;  If you can make use of the
automatic scheduling function with its emphasis on automated marketing, the
step learning curve may be worth conquering.&O;

<SUMMARY>Scherrer Resources Inc's $395 Sales Ally 3.10 personal information
management system offers a wide range of features and integrates
well with other programs and multiple users.&P;  Sales Ally uses a
basic data-entry screen that is tied to the program's features.&O;
Ten fields in the data screen accept user-defined information,
which can be limited by type.&P;  Records can be linked to indicate
corporate hierarchies and allow rapid movement between employees
of a single company.&P;  The word processing feature includes HP
LaserJet font support, but external word processing packages can
also be used because Sales Ally occupies only 10Kbytes of RAM
while inactive.&P;  The package is too large for a laptop without a
hard disk, and the user interface is occasionally inconsistent.&M;

Sales Ally When you head out to do battle in the business world, you could
use a strong ally to help carry the load.&P;  Sales Ally from Scherrer Resources
may not be one of the best-known contact management programs, but it should
be.&P;  At a list price of $395 for the single-user version, and with two
different levels of multiusers versions available, this is a feature-rich
package that should appeal both to sales and non-sales users.&M;

The program is built on Novell's Btrieve development language and database
management system.&P;  The result is a system that has a crisp, text-based look
with plenty of sophistication.&P;  Most screens offer a string of function-key
commands listed across the bottom line of the display.&P;  Some of these
commands open windows, which either prompt for more inputs or offer lists of
predefined choices.&P;  F1 brings up context-sensitive help at nearly every turn
in the program.&M;

Sales Ally relies primarily on a single data-entry screen that drives all
other functions.&P;  there is room for three different phone numbers (which can
be dialed automatically using a modem), title, nickname, company, division,
and ten user-definable fields for additional items.&P;  When you set up a
defined field, you also get to specify the type of contents it can accept,
even to the point of defining a list of acceptable responses that can be
popped-up during data entry.&M;

One outstanding feature is the ability to relate records through links,
either in horizontal or in branching relationships.&P;  This makes it easy to
jump between colleagues at the same level within a company, or to move
throughout the organizational structure of departments.&M;

The program is rich in useful features.&P;  There are lots of ways to create
letters, ranging from mail-merged letters and reports that can be applied to
one or many records at a time, to quick letter that you can create on-the-fly
right at the data-entry screen.&P;  The program has its own full-featured word
processing module, including support for LaserJet fonts, and you can use the
DOS shell feature to run your own favorite word processor.&P;  Since the program
only takes up about 10K RAM, it leaves plenty of room to run other
applications; you can load Sales Ally and let it run all day.&M;

There are dozens of preformatted reports and labels, but it's easy to create
your own using the report formatter and word processor.&P;  You can keep notes
on each record, and each note will be time and date stamped--though you can
edit the time and date if you need to enter information at a later time.&P;  You
can pop up a calculator, a calendar, or an expense-tracking program.&P;  There
are also features that let you take orders over the phone.&M;

One of the program's greatest strenghts is its ability to support multiple
users.&P;  Even in a single-user version this has benefits, since records can be
tied to "owners" and access controlled through passwords.&P;  It is simple to
export and import sections of the database, so you can take portions on the
road with a portable computer and then upload the changes to keep the main
database current.&P;  Sales Ally also imports comma-delimited ASCII files in a
flexible and friendly way, making it a snap to bring in data from outside
sources.&M;

Other multiuser features include the ability to scan others' schedules to
find times for meetings and other events.&M;

ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT&M;

The program is not without fault.&P;  The quick letter does not inclued the
printer font support offered by the word processor.&P;  The word processor also
requires you to define your printer during installation, even though yopu
already provided the information for the main program.&P;  The program is too
big to fit on floppy disks and requires a laptop with a hard disk, although
you can access data files stored on floppy disks.&P;  The user interface is not
always intuitive.&P;  For example, the Escape key sometimes removes the current
screen, while at other times only F10 will work.&P;  And for some reason, the
Insert key is used to erase the content of a field on the data-entry screen.&M;

These turn out to be minor flaws, however.&P;  The program is fast, flexible,
and efficient.&P;  It makes it easy to get a lot of work done in a hurry, and
lets you save all your letters and reports to be printed in a batch at the
end of your work session.&P;  It forces you to confront work that is overdue,
and the macro facility makes it easy to reschedule tasks for a later time.&M;

If you need a strong assistant in your corner, consider Sales Ally.&P;  Whether
you work by yourself or as part of a large team, this program can help you
track the tasks and get the work done.&O;

SalesPro Looking for an inexpensive entrance into the world of contact
management?&P;  The SoftPro Group's $195 contact management package, SalesPro,
provides the ease of use that equates fast learning and the basic
functionality that will satisfy the needs of many desk- and road-bound
salespeople.&M;

SalesPro ships on two floopy disks, and although no automated installation
program is included, the manual gives instructions concerning the files
you'll need to copy to make the program run.&P;  All the necessary files will
fit onto one 720K floppy disk for effective portability.&M;

The core of SalesPro is its client database and its client data-entry screen.&O;
The fields included in the standard database are those you're used to seeing:
client ID, name, phone number, company, address, voice and fax phone numbers,
and last date called.&P;  Should you wish to change any or all of the fields,
the database and screen are fully customizable.&P;  Once you have entered a
client/contact, you can perform a variety of tasks on that record, including
making and logging calls, adding a follow-up call to a to-do list, and
setting an alarm to remind you when you need to make that follow-up call.&O;
You can attach an unlimited number of to-do notes to each client's record.&M;

DATA SEARCHING&M;

SalesPro provides a number of data-search methods--including the ability to
search across a number of databases for like information--and you can save up
to 20 different kinds of search queries by using the software's macro
generating facility.&P;  The program will also automatically search for
duplicate client entries in the same databased on the client ID number and
alert you of any duplication errors.&M;

The client database, and any others you decide to customize, are stored in a
standard, comma-delimited database format, making export to other programs
such as spreadsheets and databases simple and direct.&M;

SalesPro includes its own simple word processor, full mail-merge and
label-making facilities, as well as a monthly calendar, calculator, inventory
and expense tracker, user-definable databases, system and file protection,
and a backup/restore feature.&P;  It also boats a host of personal features,
such as a stock manager, yield record, purchase record, and an IRS tax
worksheet.&M;

Where the program shines less brightly may present drawbacks for some users,
depending on the level of complexity you desire in a contact manager.&O;
Although the program does have a phone dialer, it cannot handle lengthy
dialing prefixes or separate local numbers from long distance--an especially
important feature when you spend equal amounts of time in the office and on
the field--and it does not offer the option to time and date stamp calls.&M;

The to-do list, word processor, and calendar suffer from lack of depth as
well.&P;  For example, you can add follow-up calls directly to your to-do list
from the client database and set the event alarm to buzz when it's time to
make the call (known in SalesPro as a "hot note"), but you cannot attach
notes to items in the to-do list brought in from the client database.&P;  You
can attach notes if you add the appointment manually.&P;  And SalesPro cannot
automatically carry undone tasks over to other days.&M;

SalesPro does offer strong, yet somewhat rudimentary report-generation
facilities.&P;  The version we tested did not come with a complete manual (a
SoftPro Group representative claims that the manual has been extensively
revised and will be shipping with the product by the time you read this
review).&M;

SalesPro excels at straightforward contact recording and management.&P;  It does
not have the same level of versatility as Act! and some of the others
included in this roundup.&P;  But is simplicity is essential, you should give
SalesPro a try.&P;  For its price, it may be hard to beat.&O;

TeleMagic Remote Control International sells TeleMagic as a telemarketing
program, but it would be a mistake to pigeonhole this $495 package ($1,995
for the network version).&P;  While it offers sophisticated telemarketing
features, such as the ability to create an invoice while working with a
contact record, it still rates as a high-powered contact tracker without
them.&M;

TeleMagic takes its orders from a combination of pop-up menus, function-key
commands, and single-letter commands.&P;  This could easily be confusing in a
poorly designed program, but TeleMagic is nothing if not well designed.&M;

SURPRISING DEPTH&M;

In fact, the TeleMagic menus are deceptively simple.&P;  The main menu has eight
chocies: Go to any record, Add a record, Dial the phone, Word Processor,
Reports, Printout, Filters for selecting records, and Other Options.&P;  Choose
Other Options, and you'll find another short menu of six choices, including
Master Controls for setup, Database utilities, and Function keys for
customizing up to 30 macros.&M;

Most packages with short menus have few features or quickly become tiresome
as you trudge through nested menus.&P;  TeleMagic has plenty of features, yet
avoids the usual pitfall of nesting.&P;  Part of the credit goes to careful
thought in choosing what gets nested where.&P;  Even more important is the
ability to access many commands from more than one place in the program.&M;

For example, the main menu and the contact-entry screen have choices for
phone dialing and word processing.&P;  And several of the function key
options--including the calculator, calendar, help screen, and shell to DOS
command--are available at anytime.&P;  The result is a program that's easy to
use for beginners and advanced users.&P;  And as you use it, you'll find that it
gradually reveals a surprising depth of features.&M;

THE FLEXIBILITY EDGE&M;

Customization is another strong point.&P;  As shipped, TeleMagic has about 20
fields, plus a free-form note field with time and date stamping for each
note.&P;  The fields include all the information you're likely to need for each
contact, but you can define up to 78 more fields.&P;  You can also modify the
standard fields.&M;

Other customizable features include help screens and scripts--text files that
a telemarketer might read as a sales pitch or that might include any kind of
reference information you may want to use while on the phone.&P;  TeleMagic will
also let you substitute your favorite word processor for the built-in editor,
define up to 50,000 filters for selecting records, and choose whether to use
password security or not.&M;

Still other features will let you index records by your choice of fields, and
import or export sets of records using fixed-length or dBASE III format.&O;
Predefined reports include choice for form letters, labels, envelopes,
Rolodex cards, a list of scheduled calls, and a Telephone Usage Analysis that
yields a phone log as part of the report.&M;

One last notable feature is TeleMagic's ability to run with other
applications.&P;  A telemarketer might work with TeleMagic all day long, but for
others the program includes a built-in version of AutoSwap.&P;  This frees up
all but 10K of RAM when you shell out to DOS, leaving plenty of room to load
another program.&P;  Even better, TeleMagic will run in the background under
Microsoft Windows 3.0.&M;

TeleMagic's few shortcomings are relatively minor.&P;  For example, it would be
useful to change filters or define new ones while at the contact record,
rather than return to the main menu.&P;  The one important oversight is that you
can't create multiple contact records as part of a single company record.&O;
However, you can work around this by creating a different record for each
contact and sorting by company name.&M;

Clearly, TeleMagic is not just for telemarketing.&P;  The combination of easy
learning, customization, and the sheer number of features puts it in the
running for nearly any contact tracking application from light-weight to
heavy-duty.&P;  Rank is as the program of choice for telemarketing, and one of
the best for most other contact management applications.&O;

TeleSell Contact management is just one part of Televeell's $695 package,
TeleSell.&P;  this three-part package, which its manufacturer bills as a
LAN-to-laptop sales solution, comes complete with three modules--the first of
which is written for the salesperson who documents all direct contacts.&M;

The second module, one level up the administrative ladder, is designed for
the managers of sales, advertising, and forecasting groups.&P;  The data from
each salesperson can be accessed on a LAN and used to establish corporate
sales, revenues, and advertising figures based on the data gleaned from
individual salesperson's databases.&P;  The third modules is designed for the
system administrator who has access to the records of the previous two
groups, and can set system defautls, produce system-wide reports, pull in
data from remote sales, forces, and generate system-wide information to be
placed on bulletin boards accessible by individuals and subgroups.&P;  TeleSell
will operate in a variety of networking situations, including Novell and IBM
networks.&M;

This much complexity and structure in one system naturally precludes a number
of features one might expect to find in single-user system.&P;  TeleSell does
not include many of the feastures you'll find in other packages in this
roundup.&P;  a built-in word processor and calendar are absent.&P;  However,
TeleSell does have a user-definable, program-list function that allows you to
choose up to four programs to shell out to in order to perform such tasks as
word processing, spreadsheet creation, and analysis.&P;  Mark LeVell of TeleVell
says that the company has worked directly with the makers of WordStar,
WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, and others to ensure the TeleSell is fully
compatible with their programs.&P;  When you do shell out to an outside
application, TeleSell shrinks to a mere 7K of RAM.&M;

Beyond that, TeleSell is as strong in the actual area of contact management
as many of the other review packages.&P;  The heart of the system is the
salesperson's module and its associated menu from which you can choose to
update or create contacts, make calls, display and/or update a to-do list, a
bulletin board that is accessible to all members of a group, print letters
composed in another program, or create reports.&M;

You can list an unlimited number of contacts per company, and multiple
individuals or products for each company in the database.&P;  This provides
extraordinary flexibility for companies with many products and contacts who
must be served by a single salesperson.&P;  TeleSell client-database screen is
composed of 24 user-customizable fields, as well as a scrolling area that
will list an unlimited number of contact actions.&M;

Unlike programs such as SalesPro, TeleSell will automatically determine if a
number is local or long distance, and will add area codes to number that are
usually local if they are dialed from the field.&P;  Users can text-search
appointments in the to-do list, and TeleSell's unique "Everywhere" feature
will search for strings in the user's database as well as in every other
database on the system to which you have security access.&M;

TeleSell will handle all standard mailmerge task, including importation of
boilerplate text and envelope or label printing.&P;  The program will aslo work
with other fax-capable programs such as ComWave and GammaLink to give you fax
capabilities as well.&M;

TeleSell includes an excellent context-sensitive on-line help facility and
video tutorial than makes installation and startup relatively painless.&M;

Although it lacks many of the functions that round out the feature-lists of
other contact management packages, TeleSell is a system that dedicates itself
to the task at hand and succeeds admirably at strick contact and sales
information management.&P;  For a company, large or small, it would be difficult
to find a more efficient way to gather and manage vital sales information.&O;

ENDURANCE TESTS&M;

There's more to portable computing than a portable PC and a modem.&P;  Not that
the actual computers aren't a big part of the equation--in fact, the six
portable PCs represented here form the heart of this endurance test.&P;  But
they are joined by a range of other devices that truly make the movable
electronic office a reality, whether you have to transport your information
from coast to coast, or just room to room.&M;

In this endurance test, the 386- and 386SX-based portable systems are put
through their paces alongside such products as LCD panels for taking your
presentations on the road, removable mass storage devices that make your data
truly transportable, and a pocket LAN adapter for plugging into your
company's network while you're at the Toledo Hilton.&P;  One of our reviewers
also spent some months with one of the most popular portable printers, the
Kodak Diconix Model 150 Plus, because no office--even when it's in a hotel
room--is ever really paperless.&M;

While three of the computers we review here provide battery power, most are
AC-only units--hence their more proper designation as "transportables."&O;
Interestingly enough, the weight of the systems involved--generally in the
neighborhood of 20 pounds--made a few of our reviewers reluctant to bring
them along on trips that involved airplane hopping or subway shuttling,
although they agree that business travelers who constantly need this kind of
portable power can probably handle the trade-off in weight.&M;

For our reviewers, the value of the machines' portability was sometimes most
apparent when they needed a machine that could move easily from room to room,
or from the office to home (provided they could get there by cab!).&P;  What
some reviewers also realized was that with systems this powerful, it often
made sense to keep them in the office as their primary machines.&P;  Even the
gas plasma screens predominant on most of these machines, as well as the
less-common LCD screens, proved comfortable for long-term viewing and our
authors stuck with them even when external monitor options were available.&M;

The past few months' explosion in the world of LCD panel technology only
confirms that the only thing you can be sure of is that you can't be sure of
anything.&P;  For instance, in the six months we've been looking at these
products, one company's unit has been upgraded twice.&P;  While Infocus
continues to sell the original eigth-color 480C PC Viewer that earned an
honorable mention back in February 27, 1990, its progressive moves to first a
64-color LCD and then a 5,000-color model proved to be the real story here,
with the latter device being the most capable of real-world presentations.&O;
Nview Corp., which won the Editor's Choice for the black-and-white Viewframe
II+2 (tested here), has itself recently introduced a 16-color LCD panel.&M;

Most of the products that form the basis of our portable computing endurance
test--removable mass storage devices, a portable printer, and an external
network adapter card--went a long way (both literally and figuratively)
toward proving that in the computing world, life is truly a movable feast.&O;

liquid crystal display (LCD) screen.&P;  The hard disk is fast and
quiet.&P;  The 83-key keyboard's layout is good, but the key movement
is stiff.&P;  The black-on-white display's detachable screen suffered
from slight banding, but most graphics were well-displayed.&P;  The

DELL COMPUTER CORP. Weighing in at a chunky 16.5 pounds in its traveling
configuration (two batteries, no AC adapter), the Editor's Choice-winning
Dell 316LT is not the kind of portable computer you want to have on your
shoulder when you're running late for a plane.&P;  But, more to the point, why
have it with you at all?&P;  A machine this good deserves a permanent place on
your desk.&M;

The 16-MHz 386SX-based 316LT, priced at $3,399 with 2MB RAM and a 40MB hard
disk, is $700 less expensive than it was at the time of our March 13, 1990
review.&P;  Given that the price includes one year of on-site service through
Xerox, the 316LT starts out with a leg up on the competition.&M;

Personally, I didn't have the need to evaluate the on-site service part of
the equation.&P;  After six months of use, the machine and all its parts are
doing fine, though some pieces are less pleasing than others.&P;  I haven't
grown used to the stiffness of the 83-key keyboard, for example, but its
layout is excellent and includes 12 full-size function keys across the top.&M;

Some people who have looked at other 316LTs, as well as some who have looked
at mine, have called the review unit's detachable backlit VGA screen muddy.&O;
I disagree.&P;  My machine's display did have some dark patches of horizontal
banding, but the problem wasn't at all serious.&P;  I enjoyed testing the screen
with PC-USA and PC-Globe, two vibrant packages full of maps that use hatching
patterns on monochrome screens to substitute for color.&P;  The 316LT did an
admirable job displaying these maps.&P;  My biggest complaint with the screen
applies to all LCD portable systems: You have to face the display full-front
or you won't see a thing.&P;  Traveling salespeople with whiz-bang presentations
should keep this in mind because the number of people who can watch your
presentation is limited.&M;

The 40MB hard disk was interesting mostly for being uninteresting: It's been
fast, quiet, and trouble-free.&P;  More intriguing were the 316LT's power
handling strategies.&P;  When the one-and-a-half pound battery was about to die
(generally after about 90 minutes with minimal disk access), I was warned and
given the chance to pop the battery out and stick in a new one without
shutting off the machine.&P;  An oversize AC power brick also accompanies the
unit.&M;

I have no compatibility complaints with the 316LT.&P;  To test it, I transferred
a good portion of my desktop hard disk over and used the 316LT just like my
everyday system.&P;  Nothing went wrong.&M;

My limited experience with Dell's technical support staff (anonymous
experimental phone calls placed at various times of day to as questions of
varying technical difficulty) has been very satisfactory--as good as Dell
desktop PC owners reported it was in our recent service and reliability
survey (September 25, 1990).&P;  The only aspect of tech support criticize was
the length of time it sometimes took to get my calls answered, though a
5-minute wait isn't too bad compared with some other tech support lines I've
called.&M;

Just how portable was the 316LT?&P;  Not portable enough, though no system over
seven pounds really is.&P;  the machine was hampered not only by weight, but
also because it hangs slightly diagonally when you carry it by its handle,
which is mounted off-center.&P;  Hold it one way, and the top angles in and
scratches your thigh.&P;  Hold it the other way, and the bottom angles in and
scratches your calf.&P;  Though contributing editor Bill O'Brien called the
machine "tidy" and referred to its "low-weight factor" in his evaluation, he
was expressing admiration for the fact that 386 processing power and a
sizable hard disk could be portable at all.&P;  As a potential piece of luggage,
which is the way I look at portable PCs, the 316LT is too heavy.&M;

Curmudgeonly pontifications aside, I appreciate the engineering that has gone
into the Dell 316LT.&P;  No need to reconsider this Editor's Choice Winner.&O;

DOLCH COMPUTER SYSTEMS In a lunchbox-style case--of a size appropriate for a
very large and hungry steelworker--the 19-pound Dolch V-PAC 386-25C packs a
25-MHz CPU, 2MB of RAM, 32K of 25-nanosecond cache RAM, an 80387 match
coprocessor, a 40MB hard disk, a 3.5-inch floppy drive, a keyboard, a
Paradise VGA Plus graphics board, a 200-watt power supply, and a crisply
legible 11-inch gas plasma screen.&P;  The memory is expandable to 8MB on the
motherboard and an additional 8MB via a 32-bit add-on card; disk options
range in sizes up to 200MB; four full-size ISA 16-bit slots are available;
and there is even room for a second floppy disk drive.&M;

Long-term exposure to this machine has changed the way I use computers.&P;  With
the $8,490 Dolch, I can have desktop power anyplace I want It.&P;  There is an
optional battery pack, but the Dolch is power hungry (not to mention heavy).&O;
While it's usable on a plane, train, or bus, it's not really practical.&P;  But
I've been able to use it at home in the living room while supervising the
kids' homework and for software development projects over weekends in the
country.&P;  Ditto for a working vacation in Florida, where I finished the
documentation for a software project.&M;

The advantage of the Dolch V-PAC 386-25C over other portables was its power.&O;
While a colleague struggled to cram a stripped-down version of Microsoft Word
onto his Toshiba 1000SE, I was using Windows 3.0, Drafix Windows CAD,
Zortech's C++ software development system, Microsoft C, various software
development utilities, the Norton Unlities, PC Tools Deluxe, the MKS toolkit,
and Lotus's hefty Manuscript word processor on my Dolch.&P;  And of course,
Rupp's Fast-Lynx file transfer software was invaluable in helping me to
easily exchange files with my more stationary machines.&M;

The Dolch proved a flawless and fleet performer, but it wasn't perfect.&P;  My
early fear was that the screen would be an obstacle, but over months of use I
never found its orange-on-black display tiring or difficult.&P;  The biggest
screen problem was heat; it gets almost too hot to touch when you use
software like Windows that illuminates most of the pixels.&P;  However, the
screen's 16 distinguishable shades of gray do a creditable job with Windows,
and the lack of ghosting makes mousing around much easier than on LCD
portables.&M;

My early affection went to the keyboard, which has a good feel and standard
three-quarter-inch key spacing.&P;  However, over time these feelings waned.&O;
The Dolch keyboard cable was too short and too stiff; all it was good for was
placing the keyboard on the table in front of the machine.&P;  I ended up using
the machine with a generic keyboard that featured a longer and more flexible
cable, and a marginally more familiar layout.&P;  However, it is to Dolch's
credit that its machine is respectful enough of PC standards to accommodate
aftermarket devices such as keyboards.&M;

Another complaint is the housing.&P;  The plastic case was rugged--the keyboard
survived several unscheduled trips to the floor--but not very elegant.&P;  The
door to the expansion card connectors seemed flimsy, and the front-panel
reset button has a hair trigger.&P;  That's not just a theoretical
complaint--once some papers jostling against the reset switch did
accidentally reboot the machine.&P;  A more trustworthy case would be a better
match for the speedy and reliable electronics.&M;

Dolch earned the PC Magazine Editor's Choice in the March 13, 1990 review of
386-based portables partly because it was the fastest machine in the group.&O;
In our December 12, 1989 review, it also won Editor's Choice because of its
speed and power.&P;  Both of those reviews concluded with the still-appropriate
summation: For those who want desktop speed and power with the compactness of
a portable, the Dolch PAC 386-35C can't be beat.&O;

IBM CORP. What can you san about a machine that defies endurance testing with
the same aplomb that earned it an Editor's Choice?&P;  Aside from the fact that
the 21-pound IBM PS/2 Model P70 386 performed its own endurance test on my
back, the system proved itself a long-term winner.&M;

Our review model was crammed with options.&P;  In addition to 8MB of RAM and a
120MB hard disk, this $14,129 machine also included a 387-20 floating-point
coprocessor, a 2,400-bit-per-second internal modem, and a 3270 emulator card.&O;
A lesser configuration comprising 4MB RAM and a 60MB hard disk sells for
$7,695.&P;  All configurations come with a VGA gas plasma display, a 1.44MB
3.5-inch floppy drive, one parallel port and one serial port, a mouse port,
and a device connector you can use to hook up an external 5.25-inch floppy
disk drive.&M;

Once I got past grumbling about IBM's usual high-end price, I was left with
little to complain about.&P;  I decided against leaving DOS 4.0 on the machine
and kept the entire 120MB hard disk partitioned as C: under DOS 4.01.&P;  I
loaded program after program onto the drive, eventually transferring the
entire contents of my own desktop PC's 65MB hard disk (both partitions) using
White Crane Systems' Brooklyn Bride.&P;  Fast file access, not a hing of a bad
sector from a Norton Utilities analysis, and no stray clusters whatsoever
marked any six months with the P70.&M;

Ordinarily, I find gas plasma displays irritating after too much use.&P;  Over
the testing period, however, I found myself staring into the thing for many a
late night.&P;  If it didn't bring on throbbing headaches at 2 A.M., it never
will.&P;  Part of the reason is the display's deft handling of the VGA color
spectrum as shades of orange/gray.&P;  A few program screens initially appeared
hard to read, but typing "mode co80" before running these programs, as IBM
recommends, invariably did the trick.&M;

No memory problems plagued my work.&P;  In fact, the P70 took on every TSR I
threw in--even Lotus Express.&P;  The internal modem did its job without a
hitch, too, as did the mouse and other I/O ports.&P;  Untested was the 3270
emulator (a friend with a 370 mainframe was away).&M;

If you need to get at the motherboard, entry is a snap thanks to three screws
that can be turned with a coin.&P;  The P70's nonslip handle must have been
tested in New York City during the summer.&P;  And, aside from the P70's overall
weight, the model's design and balance allow easy transport.&P;  The light
construction of its rear case cover troubled me, though.&P;  You'll need to be
careful with those little sliding doors that permit access to the ports and
power jack.&M;

One other quibble is that the keyboard's cord proved entirely too stiff.&P;  And
the keyboard, I am convinced, will be too clicky for many users (but for a
portable PC, that's a compliment).&P;  You won't be able to tell where IBM
paired down the length of its keyboard--no mental adjustment from your usual
desktop PC will be necessary.&M;

IBM is no stranger to the occasional uninspired product release.&P;  With the
IBM PS/2 Model P70 386, however, Big Blue flexes the muscles that made it
number one, and presents a portable PC that's a class act all the way.&O;

PC BRAND INC. During six months of steady use, the AC-only PC Brand 386/25
Cache Portable III delivered nearly brand-name performance for below
brand-name price.&P;  In this case, "nearly" meant a lot more than just good
enough.&P;  The system was helped by a 32K RAM cache, which was lacking in the
unit we originally reviewed in our March 13, 1990, issue.&M;

The PC Brand Portable III is one of those Compaq Portable III look-alikes.&O;
It measures 9.8 by 16.2 by 8.3 inches (HWD) and weighs about 25 pounds.&O;
Maneuvering this heavyweight into its canvas carrying case is like shoving an
anvil into a sock: It's a very tight fit.&P;  Anyway, my experience with it
leads me to recommend that you don't sling this monster over your shoulder,
except to the elevator or the car.&P;  Use a luggage carrier.&M;

Once I got the Portable III up and running, I found that it was worth the
weight.&P;  The fully loaded $4,784 review unit was a wish list come true: 4MB
RAM, a 100MB hard disk, 1.2MB 5.25-inch and I.44MB 3.5-inch disk drives, a
VGA gas plasma display, one parallel port and one serial port, DOS 4.01,
utilities, and carrying case.&P;  Add a 1,200-bit-per-second internal PC Brand
modem (for $49), and you've got all the on-the-road computer you'll need.&M;

I used the open 8-bit slot for a Microsoft Mouse bus card, which clicked
right in very nicely.&P;  Lots of time was spent using Microsoft Windows/386 and
Aldus Page-Maker on the machine--both ran like a charm.&P;  Text was crisp, but
I initially had a problem with contrast in the highlighted menu bars.&P;  Having
ported Windows over from my VGA color monitor-equipped desktop machine, I had
to reset it to run in black-and-white mode to enhance contrast.&P;  Contrast was
also a problem in some non-Windows-based programs.&P;  SideKick's calculator,
for example, practically lost its Total.&P;  However, if you're familiar with a
program, being unable to read a few options here and there is not big deal.&O;
XyWrite III and Lotus 1-2-3--which I use most of the time--ran quickly,
clearly, and without a hitch.&M;

A more serious problem was that while adjusting the angle of the display, I
lost all the edits in a XyWrie file when the reset button, located at the
bottom-left corner of the bezel, was accidentally hit.&P;  This was no fluke.&O;
After a co-worker reading over my shoulder did the same thing, I had to put a
"DO NOT TOUCH" sticker next to the button.&M;

The detachable 86-key keyboard, which protects the screen in transit, isn't
full size but felt just right.&P;  If you're like me and in the habit of resting
your fingers heavily on the home keys between thoughts, you wan't get a row
of gibberish on-screen.&P;  I did seem to hit the Backslash instead of the
Backspace key a lot more than usual, though.&M;

I was impressed with the Portable III's overall sturdiness.&P;  It took its
share of minor slams without a hint of trouble, which brings me to the
service issue.&P;  although nothing went awry with the unit while I had it, I
periodically made anonymous calls to PC Brand's tech support line.&P;  On an
average, I was put on hold for about 10 minutes, somewhat longer than I would
have preferred, but at least all my questions were patiently and thoroughly
answered.&P;  When I complained about the documentation because it was primarily
devoted to PC Brand's desktop machines, the support staffer offered to send
me a manual for the portable; that was some weeks ago, and as of this writing
I still haven't received it.&M;

My biggest disappointment was the Portable III's FCC Class A rating, which
made using it at home impracticable--a real drawback for a machine that you
would conceivably want to use for take-home assignments.&P;  In the end, it's
true that the PC Brand 386/25 Cache Portable III lacks the "fit and finish"
of those dark and handsome brand-name portables, but then, you donht need a
Mercedes to drive to the office.&O;

TOSHIBA AMERICA INFORMATION SYSTEMS INC. The $8,897 Toshiba T5200/100, with
its 20-MHz 386 processor, 100MB hard disk, and 2MB of RAM, is one powerful
portable.&P;  Extended use of the system showed it quite capable of performing
the same tasks I'd ask of my desktop machine.&P;  Applications like Samna's Ami
Professional ran fine under Windows 3.0; it's all less colorful on Toshiba's
orange-tinted, gas plasma VGA screen than it is on my desktop monitor, but
quite as functional.&P;  Nor were there any problems with character-based
applucations like XyWrite, Lotus 1-2-3, and Harvard Graphics.&P;  I also played
a few rounds of railroads Tycoon--not the most graphics-intensive game
around, but still a good test for the display, which showcased it with
satisfactory results.&M;

At nearly 19 pounds, the Toshiba T5200 proved to be too much of a monster to
lug through airports, so it didn't accompany me on out-of-town business trips
very often.&P;  Instead, it wound up spending most of its weekday time sharing
office space with my desktop machine.&P;  Not that I didn't put the T5200's
reputation for ruggedness to the test.&P;  It has survived intact a number of
car trips from PC Magazine's offices in Manhattan to my home in Queens.&O;
We're talking rides along the Long Island Expressway and the 59th Street
Bridge, both perhaps best known for their plethora of potholes.&M;

I upgraded the Toshiba with an internal modem shortly after it arrived, a
troublefree process.&P;  Before the machine ever got a chance to leave the
office, though, it had one failure.&P;  About three weeks into using it, a thin,
vertical black line appeared down the left side of the screen.&P;  I called
technical support (without indentifying myself), and was told to insert my
DOS 3.3 disk in the A: drive and then boot from that; the technician
explained that something in my CONFIG.SYS OR AUTOEXEC.BAT file might be the
cause of the trouble.&P;  An odd suggestion, but I played along, and the line
was still there upon rebooting.&M;

When I innocently asked if I might not just detach and send back the screen
for repair, I was informed that there was no way to tell if the problem was
in the screen or with the video card.&P;  I'll certainly give the technician
points for being friendly and patient, but he should have at least known that
the T5200 supports an external monitor, and that I could have hooked one up
to it to help identify whether the video controller or the display was at
fault.&M;

When I called Toshiba again, identify myself as a PC Magazine editor, I was
told that what had probably happened was that one of the wires on the plasma
screen had broken.&P;  I was sent a replacement screen to install myself.&P;  Most
users whose systems are still under warranty, however, would have returned
the machine to Toshiba's Field Service department or an a uthorized service
provider for repair.&M;

To be fair, other calls made to tech nical support met with a lot more
practical success, and equally friendly help.&P;  I called at various hours, and
was never kept waiting formore than two or three minutes, usually less than
one.&M;

I have a few complaints, one of which is that the display generates a lot of
heat.&P;  And while I thought that in time I would get used to the soft-touched
keyboard, I still invariably hit the Insert key when I mean to hit Delete.&M;

All in all, the T5200 has been a reliable companion.&P;  while I don't need to
all its computing power for on-the-road work, anyone who does will probably
find the tradeoff in weight acceptable.&P;  For me, it served as a fine desktop
machine, albeit one that would benefit by being attached to both a cooler
external monitor and keyboard; too bad it supports only the first option.&O;

TOSHIBA AMERICA INFORMATION SYSTEMS INC. Five months with the Toshiba T3100SX
has taught me two things; one is that I need a battery-powered portable
386-class machine; the other is that portable computing is fraught with
compromises, no matter how good your CPU design.&P;  While I was pleased with
the 16-MHz 386SX processor, VGA gas plasma display, 40MB hard disk, built-in
2,400-bit-per-second modem, and Resume feature on this $7,446 machine, I was
less impressed by its mediocre battery life, lack of manual screen controls,
and the confusing layout of the keyboard.&M;

Toshiba wins high marks for its user-friendly easy-to-upgrade design.&P;  The
test began with the installation of the 2,400-bps internal modem, which
required removing two screws holding a slot cover in place, inserting the
modem into the newly vacated space, reinstalling the screws, and then running
the Toshiba setup software to assign a COM port to the modem.&P;  While this
unit did not have built-in error correction, it nonetheless performed
flawlessly with all major telecommunications programs, displaying a high
degree of compatibility with the Hayes AT command set for the 2,400-bps
modem.&M;

I also installed an additional 2MB of RAM to bring the system up to 3MB.&O;
Much to my surprise, performing the memory upgrade was easy; I simply removed
the screws that hold the keyboard in place, removed the keyboard, and
installed the proprietary memory module.&P;  With room for three memory modules,
the system can accommodate a maximum of 13MB, more than adequate for all but
the most arduous applications.&P;  With the keyboard off, you also have access
to the 387SX socket, making installation a snap for those needing the speed
and power of a floating-point processor.&M;

The ergonomically designed shoulder strap on the optional carrying case made
it almost easy to lug around the 16-plus pounds of CPU and transformer.&P;  The
wealth of pockets came in handy for collecting press materials during trade
shows.&P;  Unfortunately, the Velcro strips on the outside of the case that are
used to keep the external pocket flat when empty would often catch on my
clothing, ruining a few of my wool sweaters.&P;  Toshiba, please take the Velcro
off the outside of the carrying case.&M;

During the course of the review, I did not experience a single hardware
problem with the 3100SX.&P;  In that time, I've traveled over 20,000 miles with
the machine, kicking it under airplane seats, throwing luggage on top of it
in the trunk of a car, and bouncing it on my hip walking the length of
Hartsfield International Airport.&P;  The 3100SX never failed to power up, never
had a problem reading the hard disk, and never complained about the abuse I
heaped on it.&M;

While the 3100SX shines in both 386 performance and reliability, it did fall
short of the mark in a few of the areas more specifically related to its
mission as a portable.&P;  Battery life (which has been a problem in other
Toshiba portables) was disappointing for the 3100SX.&P;  At the end of this
evaluation, I ran the PC Labs battery rundown test, and the system logged 2
hours and 31 minutes.&P;  However, I was never able to get much more than 2
hours of running time using my standard set of applications (Microsoft
Windows 3.0, MS-Excel, MS-Word for DOS, Lotus Express, and Quick-BASIC
4.5)--even with two battery packs and power conservation enabled.&M;

It is worth mentioning, though, that one of our contributing editors is quite
impressed with the battery life on the T3100SX he owns, noting that he's used
its battery power almost nightly because of the frequent summer thunderstorms
experienced in his part of the country.&P;  He says that he routinely gets the
advertised three hours despite heavy hard disk access and other factors that
would more quickly burn up the battery of a lesser machine.&M;

Lack of screen adjustments for brightness and contrast made the display
difficult to read in certain overhead lighting situations.&P;  While the plasma
display was fine in an environment like Windows, the Toshiba character font
left much to be desired in text mode.&P;  (In all fairness, this is the same
character font Toshiba uses in its other plasma-screen portables.)&M;

Another annoyance was the keyboard.&P;  While its feel was on a par with many
desktop units, the cursor keys were practically lost in a vertical column on
the right.&P;  If the 3100Sx was my only PC, I could probably become accustomed
to that layout, but switching between it and the IBM keyboard on my desktop
gave me a severe case of finger dyslexia.&M;

These minor quibbles aside, the fact that the 3100SX has survived this
endurance drive with only a few scratches on its case shows that it's quite a
survivor.&P;  It has gone a long way toward closing the gap between a portable
and a desktop system, and has proven itself to be best battery-powered 386SX
you can buy--for now.&O;

IN FOCUS SYSTEMS INC. In most areas of the PC business, technology is rapidly
changing.&P;  With LCD panels, change seems to be the only constant.&P;  Witness
the In Focus 480C PC Viewer, whose technology leapfrogged three times since I
began this endurance review.&M;

Six months ago, when I was handed the $3,995 In Focus 480C PC Viewer, it was
a state-of-the-are device--a true color LCD that projected eight colors at
640- by-480-dpi resolution.&P;  While black-and-white projection panels looked
boring in contrast, the truth of the matter was that the eight-color LCD
images I was getting were...um...less than vivid.&M;

Within a few months of that product's arrival, In Focus sent me its 64-color
LCD.&P;  The $4,495 64-color 480CX was marginally better because I was able to
get more colors from a VGA display, but it was still not a device for
top-notch presentations.&P;  Most recently, I got a very brief glance at the
luscious new 5000CX, In Focus's 5,000-color LCD.&P;  (The company continues to
sell the older models in the line.)&M;

The project began as an exercise in futility, since the eight-color unit was
simply not adequate for my VGA presentations.&P;  Images I created on a VGA
screen with 256 colors looked crummy when output to the eight-color device.&O;
Additionally, I would often project an image only to find that I couldn't
display VGA slides containing titles, bullet points, and clip art without
losing one or mor of these elements, depending on the colors I'd chosen.&O;
Ultimately, I found myself having to remake images specifically for output to
the LCD panel's limited colors.&P;  Even though the system has a built-in color
palette toggle to maximize your chances of seeing as many colors as possible,
it was insufficient.&P;  With the 64-color panel, I still had to fiddle with the
palette, especially when the presentation relied on images from many sources.&M;

Made of three LCDs (cyan, magenta, and yellow) sandwiched together, the 480C
LCD uses a subtractive color process (removing color from white pixels).&P;  The
64-color 480CX uses the same three LCDs, but its newer technology lets each
of the panels have four levels of gray.&P;  The $5,995 5000CX also uses the same
three panels, but packs 17 gray shades (actually 16 gray and 1 brightness)
onto each panel, for a total of 5,000 colors.&P;  This last system enabled my
endurance test to end on a happy note; in fact, the 5000CX is the first LCD
technology I would consider buying.&P;  Its images projected with startlingly
good color and were quite bright.&M;

Even though the 480C and the 64-color CX model don't come with a carrying
case (an optional cloth bag is available for $129), I carted these units
everywhere in their cardboard boxes with carrying handles.&P;  Wherever I went I
was plugged in quickly and able to adjust the sync, contrast and palette for
a reasonable (though not always optimal) display.&M;

My biggest problems with the 480C and the 64-color CX stemmed more from
external sources than from the units themselves.&P;  One problem was the
diversity of overhead projection units out there.&P;  In Focus sells its own
wonderfully compact overhead projector that uses a special 360-watt quartz
lamp and puts out 3,000 lumens.&P;  Other overhead projectors I used weren't
nearly as bright, and their light tended to be concentrated in the middle of
the unit.&P;  Not only would I lose the edges of my images, but sometimes these
overheads simply didn't emanate enough light to make images legible.&P;  The
only way I could really trust the presentation was to take both the overhead
the LCD with me--pushing the limits of portability and my own strength.&M;

This endurance test has made me more convinced than ever that there is a
right media for each type of presentation.&P;  LCDs will never be the optimal
display technology for all presentations; for instance, I still prefer slides
for my most formal (and controlled) presentations.&P;  And while all the LCDs
have the advantage of portability, even the 5000CX displays less-vivid images
than a three-gun data projector.&M;

However, the 480C PC Viewer, with which I spent the most time, proved
incredibly trustworthy and highly portable, as did the 480CX.&P;  (I didn't have
the 5000CX long enough to make a judgment on its ruggedness, but if the other
two products are any indication, it should prove equally tough.)&P;  As a
die-hard PC user, compatibility wasn't a big issue to me, but others will
appreciate that all the In Focus panels accept signals from MAC, MACII, CGA,
VGA, and EGA.&P;  Offering maximum flexibility, these systems can't be beat for
PC training sessions.&M;

By the time you read this article, In Focus should have launched LiteShow, a
small add-on box that captures, organizes, sequences, and presents PC images.&O;
The unit gets hooked up and drives the LCD panel, which means you can leave
the computer at home, but still take your show on the road.&O;

NVIEW CORP. When we last reviewed LCD panels ("LCD Panels: 12 for the Road,"
February 27, 1990), color was the exception to the rule.&P;  Ten months later,
color LCDs are coming down in price and up in performance, but when it comes
to crispness and clarity the black-and-white display of the Editor's Choice
ViewFrame II+2 is still quite appealing.&P;  The unit's extra niceties--the
hard-shell carrying case, remote infrared keyboard option ($395), and three
sets of cables for Macintosh, CGA/EGA, and VGA monitors--completed this
affordable integrated unit.&M;

TThe ViewFrame displays images using eight shades of gray.&P;  I was able to map
these shades as closely as possible to images created on a VGA screen and
containing 256 and 16 colors by fiddling with three small colored knobs on
the side of the panel that correspond to red, green, and blue.&P;  Even though
nView provides a utility disk to help you get the best settings, I found that
when I displayed VGA 16-color graphics images with the ViewFrame, some of the
detail in my artwork got lost unless I set the controls on an image-by-image
basis (theoretically, you should only need to set these once during a
presentation).&P;  When I presented textual material, or demonstrated a single
application, I fared much better since the original colors did not differ so
much from frame to frame.&P;  I also found that by eliminating the majority of
color from the LCD, I was left with a monochromatic pixel pattern display
which was quite effective for presentations that didn't use colored graphics.&M;

In addition to the color controls, the ViewFrame allows for adjusting
contrast and shifting the image horizontally or vertically.&P;  The controls
were clearly labeled on the top of the panel, but adjustments are made by
twisting cylindrical knobs that jut out of the side.&P;  My experience was that
making these adjustments during live presentations could be difficult.&M;

Similar to the In Focus LCD, the nView's LCD performance depended on the
quality of my overhead projector.&P;  Many standard overhead projectors simply
did not emit enough light, or the light caused a ring in the center and
darkened edges on the viewing area.&P;  Only a top-notch projector with a strong
light produced adequate results.&M;

Projecting images with dark color backgrounds also proved to be a problem.&O;
Over time, especially at the unit heated up, the backgrounds would shimmer
and weave, making it terribly hard on the eye.&P;  Unless I played with the
controls on a per-image basis, I experienced ghosting and occasionally, afte
r the unit was on for a while, a black line (one pixel wide) would appear on
the screen until I readjusted the colors.&M;

Probably the best part of my nView experience was the nView Toteboard, the
remote infrared keyboard, which renewed my faith in infrared technology.&P;  A
small receiver unit hooks into the keyboard socket on your PC and you walk
away with an ultra-light portable keyboard that's half the size of a regular
one.&P;  I found the infrared responsive, even when I was positioned at strange
angels.&M;

Together, the totable keyboard, heavy-duty case (which can double as luggage
on your next trip), and affordable panel make an attractive package.&P;  The
only problem is that black and white simply won't cut it for the most
demanding presenter, who may be more interested in the company's recently
released, $2,995 16-"simulated"-color LCD

44Mbyte cartridges, and although the 32-millisecond access time is
not fast, it is sufficient for most uses.&P;  The drive can be used
for booting the system, backing up files or storing extra data and
software.&P;  The evaluated unit had problems with cartridge
chirping, but Iomega representatives say only one percent of the
Bernoulli cartridges chirp.&P;  The chirping stops if the cartridges
are not left spinning in the drive, but this solution makes the
Bernoulli Box less simple to use.&P;  When the test unit mysteriously
ruined some cartridge data, Iomega replaced the unit under

IOMEGA CORP. If asked to figuration my ideal system, an Iomega 44MB Bernoulli
Box II would definitely be on my list.&M;

IHve been using the $2,599 BBII for about a year now.&P;  for the first eight
months or so it functioned as the main storage medium for an IBM AT; although
I always booted from my hard disk, I ran all my programs from and stored all
my data on the cartridges.&P;  the 32-millisecond drives aren't terribly fast
compared with today's hard disks--the newer 22-millisecond, SCSI-based
Universal Dual Drive BBIIs improve upon that--but I found it more than
adequate for playing disk-intensive games as well as for running
less-demanding applications such as XyWrite, Instant Recall, and Lotus 1-2-3.&O;
It also provided a great way to transport large graphics files from one
system to another.&P;  Although benchmark tests might show otherwise, I was
never able to tell whether the bundled version of Multisoft's generally
excllent PC-Kwik disk caching program really made an impact on performance.&M;

Once I switched from my AT to a 25-MHz 80386 with a larger hard disk, my BBII
became a storage area for overflow data and applications, as well as my
backup device.&P;  (The box comes with Backit, but I used the more flexible
Norton Backup software).&P;  Since my hard drive is broken up into 32MB
partitions, backing up each partition onto a separate cartridge is a snap.&O;
for those with non-partitioned hard disks, this system would of course be
less effective than a streaming tape backup device; it beats floppies by a
longshot, though.&M;

Not once did I encounter a software compatibility problem, even when dealing
with pre-release software or hardware-sensitive programs such as Windows 3.0.&O;
Since it doesn't use an IRQ, I esperienced no hardware conflicts, either.&M;

On the other hand, I did run into a problem with chirping cartridges--no
physical damage, but a very irritating noise that sounded as if a bird were
treapped in the unit.&P;  The first time it happened, technical support sent me
a replacement cartridge overnight via Federal Express (with no knowledge of
my position at PC Magazine).&P;  More recently, when another of my cartridges
began chirping, an Iomega representative gently pointed out that if I cleaned
the drive heads once a month--as the documentation suggests--the chirping
might stop.&P;  He also told me not to leave the cartridges constantly spinning
in the drive.&P;  The latter finally quieted the chirp, but put a serious dent
in the "transparent operation" of the unit; in order for the drive to
re-recognize the cartridge, you have to pull it out and push it in again.&O;
Iomega says that only about one percent of the cartridges suffer from this
problem, although an older batch (of which mine may have been a part) had a
slightly higher incidence rate.&M;

More seriously, after about six months of use, the unit trashed some
important files on one of my cartridges (in one of those teeth-grinding
episodes that teaches you why backing up is so important).&P;  Iomega was
surprised at this turn of events, and although I sent them both the drive and
cartridge for their inspection, I was never informed as to the cause
nalthough I made many attempts to find out).&P;  Whether the fault lies with the
unit or the vagaries of the DOS FAT system remains a mystery.&P;  As warranty
policy dictates, they sent me a replacement unit and I have had no problems
since.&M;

As one of those people who constantly finds herself short of hard disk space,
the BBII is a godsend; for a little over $2 a megabyte--the mail-order price
for a tripack of 44MB cartridges is hovering around $300--I have an infinite
amount of extra storage capacity.&P;  The BBII has really spoiled me for life.&O;
I simply can't envision working without it.&O;

PLUS DEVELOPMENT CORP. The Plus Development Passport won an Editor's Choice
in our September 13, 1988, issue for its now-legendary versatility and its
ease of installation and use.&P;  Indeed, this $1,454 2.5-pound,
1.3-by-5-by-7-inch (HWD) removable hard disk, with its 28-millisecond access
time and patented AIRLOCK automatic head-parking system, has become a
standard by which all removable hard disks are measured.&M;

As advertised, the Passport installed simply and quickly.&P;  I secured the
ISA-bus RLL controller card and the single-unit base housing into my
286-based PC's Limited computer with the help of only one small screwdriver.&O;
(Plus makes a controller for MCA machines as well.)&P;  I used the excellent
instruction manuals to partition, format, access, and use the disk.&P;  For the
only question I did have, concerning a conflict between the hard disk already
installed in the computer and the Passport, Plus Development's able technical
staff helped by pointing me to a reference in the documentation I had missed.&M;

I followed the installation with some months of using the Passport as a boot
disk, copying the contents of other hard disk to it in repetitive fashion,
reformatting, repartitioning, recopying, adding and erasing files, running
access-intensive database and communications programs from it, and using
disk-defragmentation programs on it--in general, doing all the things you'd
normally do to a hard disk on a system that sees a lot of different software
and uses.&P;  Its 28-ms.&P;  access time theoretically can't compare with the likes
of the 16-ms.&P;  hard disks now in existence, but in practice, I never felt the
speed difference.&P;  Additionally, during all this time, the Passport acted
just like any steady, unflappable, screw-mounted 40MB hard disk.&P;  It stored
and delivered my data without so much as a cough.&M;

Perhaps the greatest danger to removable hard disks, in particular, is plain
old gravity.&P;  Plus Development advertises a 150G shock rating.&P;  In order to
test this, I devised a number of scientific tests you may not want to try at
home--at least not on purpose.&P;  First I tried our highly scientific "drop it
on the desk" test.&P;  Not even a scratch--and the thing booted my computer
every time.&P;  Next, I resorted to the "drop it on the floor" test.&P;  Again, the
Passport whirred away in the face of adversity.&M;

I upped the ante with a special "cloth-briefcase" test, which consisted of
one full month's travel to and from the PC Magazine offices in the bottom of
my nylon carry-bag sans protective case--via the New York City subway system.&O;
The Passport fared better than I did, surviving heat, vibration, metal
turnstiles, the occasional sprint to the train, and one vicious kick by an
angry-looking man in a business suit.&P;  Each morning it booted my computer as
if it had never left its half-height home.&M;

As a final test, I sent my Passport on separate vacations to three locations
around the country via overnight Federal Express.&P;  In fairness, this time I
enclosed the little beast in its protective ABS plastic case and that in a
sturdy box.&P;  Each time it returned, the box looked considerably less sturdy,
but the Passport and its protective case looked--and acted--just fine.&M;

Not only did the Plus Passport prove itself an able survivor, it was quite
useful.&P;  Sensitive files could be removed for the night or weekend, taken
with me or locked away with confidence that they'd be waiting the next time I
needed them.&P;  As far as data storage is concerned, confidence is the name of
the endurance game.&P;  It's a game the Plus Passport appears to have won
handily.&O;

<SUMMARY>Tandon Corp's Ad Pac and Personal Data Pac removable hard disk
drive system is durable and easily installed and used, but the
drive is slow and lacks a method of manually ejecting the drive
from the housing.&P;  The $770 combined system stores 30Mbytes and
has an 85-millisecond access time.&P;  The controller card includes a
128Kbyte disk cache to improve the drive's speed.&P;  The Data Pac
can tolerate heavy physical abuse, and the drive works with all
types of software.&P;  The drive can only be ejected through
software, so if the computer system crashes, the card, docking
station and drive must be taken to another system to eject the
Data Pac.&M;

TANDON CORP. The Tandon Personal Data Pac with its 30MB of storage space has
spent most of the testing period in the 4.5-by-6-by-10.5-inch Ad Pac docking
unit mounted on top of the Dell 310 in my office, taking time out only for
excursions meant to test its durability.&P;  It seems to have taken nicely to
the steady diet of data I've been feeding it, faithfully--if not always
speedily--performing all the tasks I've asked.&M;

Installing the $770 Ad Pac/Data Pac combination in my system proved to be as
simple as installing any standard hard drive.&P;  The ISA-bus RLL controller
card was inserted in my machine and a cable attached from the back plate on
the card to the Ad Pac docking unit.&P;  A second Ad Pac unit can be installed
by attaching a daisy-chain connector between the units.&P;  The step-by-step
installation procedures accompanying the Ad Pac were clear and well
illustrated.&M;

Tandon's version of DOS directly supports the Ad Pac.&P;  Users like myself who
have non-Tandon DOS have to include a DEVICE= statement in their CONFIG.SYS
file to load a device driver into boot-up.&P;  This is quite common these days,
and using 386Max I loaded the driver into high memory.&P;  I also needed to run
a program to configure the Ad Pac to run as the second drive controller in my
system.&P;  The parameters were easy to set and I was up and running in a few
minutes.&M;

Although the 2-pound, 10-ounce Data Pac was called fast in our September 13,
1988 review of removable media, I found it to be noticeably slow by today's
standards.&P;  Its rated access time is 85 milliseconds, aided by a 128K cache
on the controller card.&P;  I copied several directories from my internal hard
disk drive onto the unit and went about my daily business of programming the
PC Labs benchmark programs.&P;  This can be a very disk intensive operation and
on the Tandon system, it took a significantly longer time to do my work.&P;  A
quick run of the PC Labs DOS File Access test showed the Data Pac to be two
to three times slower than my 19-ms.&P;  internal drive, with random accesses
taking the biggest performance hit.&P;  The slower speed will be most noticeable
in applications that make heavy use of the disk, such as databases.&P;  Word
processing and spreadsheet applications generally load their data into memory
once and will be less affected by a slow disk drive.&P;  A software disk cache
to supplement the controller's on-board cache can speed up applications that
access the same data repeatedly.&M;

I half expected the Hard Drive Police to take me away in handcuffs for the
abuse I gave my Data Pac.&P;  I tossed the 2.5-by-4.7-by-7-inch (HWD) drive into
my soft sided brief case, threw it onto my car seat for weekend excursions,
and knocked it about on the train trip to and from work.&P;  It pained me, a
person who religiously parks the heads on drives before moving machines, to
drop this drive from tower case and table top heights.&P;  Yet after each
torture the Data Pac performed flawlessly.&M;

Software compatibility is important to me when choosing a drive.&P;  The Ad Pac
worked well on my system under the 4DOS COMMAND.COM alternative and 386Max
memory manager.&P;  I used Norton Utilities to explore the contents of the disk,
defragment the files, and test the drive after my many abuses.&P;  Everything
always worked perfectly.&M;

Tandon's device drive attaches a set of hotkey for ejecting the Data Pac
drive.&P;  The keys conflicted with my editor program and although I could have
easily redefined them, I opted to disable this feature and use the DPEJECT
utility at the DOS command line to eject the drive.&P;  Unfortunately, the drive
cannot be ejected without the hotkey or DPEJECT.&P;  If your system goes down,
the controller, docking unit, and drive must be installed on another system
to eject the Data Pac.&M;

Except for its slow speed and lack of manual eject, the Tandon Ad Pac/Data
Pac combination proved to be a rugged, hard worker.&P;  The drive unit was a
comfortable size and weight for carrying around and I didn't have to pamper
it in transit.&P;  For the executive with a second machine at home or an office
where people share PCs, the Tandon unit provides the convenience of popping
in a drive that is fully configured to an individual's needs.&O;

<SUMMARY>Xircom Inc's $845 Pocket Token-Ring Adapter and $595 Pocket
Ethernet Adapter are external network cards that can be used with
most portable computers, but installation and use is so simple
that the cards can also be used to temporarily network
microcomputers.&P;  The cards weigh 5 ounces and plug into the
computer's parallel port.&P;  The adapter and its network connector
add 6 inches or more to the system depth unless a flexible cable
is used to reposition the adapter.&P;  The adapter does not currently
allow a printer to share the parallel port, but Xircom has
developed a $95 printer adapter to allow port sharing.&P;  The
network adapters are slightly slower than ordinary bus cards, but
the performance difference is barely noticeable.&M;

XIRCOM INC. Compared with a traditional network interface card, Xircom's
Pocket Adapters for connecting a laptop or portable PC to network cost more,
run slower--and are wonderful.&P;  Almost no one who owns a portable and
regularly use a network--Xircom offers token ring, Ethernet, and Arcnet
adapters--should be without one.&P;  The 5-ounce, 5-inch units plug right into
your parallel port, so you don't need an internal slot or expansion chassis.&M;

Of course, it would be impossible to test the adapters on every portable in
existence, but in extended use, the Xircom Token-Ring and Ethernet adapters
proved hassle free when connected to a Toshiba T3100SX, a Compaq LTE 286, and
an NEC ProSpeed 286.&P;  If you benchmark test them, you'll find about 65 to 90
percent of the throughput of a good expansion-bus network interface card
(Token-Ring is faster than Ethernet).&P;  But in day-to-day use, I didn't notice
much speed difference--certainly nothing worse than the minute-to-minute
variations you find when your network is actively serving multiple users.&M;

More than a few times, I've also turned to the Xircom adapters as the
Token-Ring or Ethernet network interface card of choice for a temporary
network connection for desktop PCs.&P;  Here's why, in a nutshell: They're
incredibly simple to set up and use.&P;  You don't have to open up the machine,
installation is switchless and a breeze, and there are no interrupts or
memory address conflicts to worry about.&P;  Additionally, ready-to-go drivers
for Novell NetWare were included, as were NET-BIOS support for IBM PC LAN,
Banyan VINES, and Artisoft LANtastic, with more on the way.&P;  The Ethernet
version has additional drivers, including LAn Manager and 3Com 3+ (the Arcnet
version has a few less).&P;  You'll be up and running on the network in five to
ten minutes from the moment you open the box.&P;  The manual may be a bit terse
for some end users who use but don't really understand networks; for anyone
else, everything you need to know is logically laid out.&M;

The Xircom adapters look like pocket modems or packs of cigarettes.&P;  Two
knurled screws attach the adapter to your parallel port.&P;  Ther's also a
transformer cube (supplied) that provides 12 volts DC to power the adapter;
sure it was clunky, but there's no easy way to draw power from a parallel
port.&P;  Connecting an adapter to any of the machines took only about 30
seconds.&M;

The Xircom adapter you'll buy depends on your network operating system and
media cabling.&P;  Prices range from $395 (Arcnet) to $595 (Ethernet) to $845
(Token-Ring).&P;  Those prices proportionally reflect the relative prices of
internal adapter cards.&P;  Expect to see prices come down as technology
advances and as Xircom sees competition from vendors like DLink.&M;

The only two hassles I encountered can be readily resolved.&P;  The adapter plus
the media (network cable) connector extended the depth of laptop or desktop
PCs by at least 6 inches; you'll likely want to buy a short (8 inches or
less) flexible cable to angle the adapter off to the side.&P;  It should have
been included with the Xircom adapter and may in the future.&P;  And, of course,
I also lot the use of the parallel port on the systems to which I connected
it; Xircom was due to ship in October a $95 printer pass-through adapter
called the Port Multiplexor, which will let you keep both the network adapter
and a printer attached to your parallel port.&M;

If only every product worked as well as Xircom's network adapters .&P;  .  .&O;

EASTMAN KODAK CO. It's the world's oldest cliche, but good things do come in
small packages.&P;  Kodak's Diconix Model 150 Plus portable printer ($519 in its
parallel version)is all the proof you need that small is indeed beautiful,
but this tiny ink jet has more than just small size to recommend it.&P;  I've
had our test sample for some months now, and I've been consistently impressed
with the intelligence and thoughfulness not only of its design, but also of
its supporting materilas.&M;

True road warriors--people who work on tray tables, on hotel room "desks,"
and in crowded airport lounges--would be pleased enough with the Diconix
simply because it is so tiny.&P;  Everywhere I set it up, I got the same
reaction: People looked, blinked, and said something like, "That's a
printer?"&P;  Yep, it's a printer, and one that fit in the side pocket of my
Toshiba T1000 case.&P;  I had to rearrange the contents of the case a bit to
find room for the Diconix's power supply/charger unit, but nevertheless there
wa space left over for its manuals and a spare ink supply cartridge.&M;

The spare ink supply and printhead are a single unit.&P;  When I ran out of ink,
I simply lowered a retaining bar, popped in a new cartridge and blotter, and
snapped the retaining bar back into place.&P;  The whole process took about a
minute.&P;  While it's simple enough to accomplish on a moving train, this
procedure might be better left to the clam, motionless environment of a hotel
room, because the cartridge must be primed before it's inserted into the
machine.&P;  This involves poking a straightened paper clip into a hole at one
end, and forcing a drop of ink onto the printhead.&P;  Cartridges must also be
primed after a long period of disuse while installed.&P;  I managed to get ink
on my hands at least once, and I shudder to think of what a clumsy move could
do to my best suit.&P;  That's a minor complaint though.&M;

The replacement cartridges are cleverly packaged in sealed foil containers;
they were rugged enough to absorb a fair amount of abuse as I lugged them
around.&P;  I was able, however, to rupture both the container and the cartridge
itself by deliberately stepping on one packaged spare--that's an extreme
test, but some care is in order when handling or transporting these spare ink
supplies.&M;

On my last trip to Washington via the Amtrak Metroliner, I was able to set up
and print with the Diconix with no more than the usual hassles associated
with getting PC, printer, and cable to work together.&P;  Realistically, though,
this isn't possible on a single coach-sized tray table.&P;  Since I was
fortunate enough not to have a seat-mate, I was able to allot one tray to my
Toshiba and one to the Diconix, and merrily print out a manuscript I was
working on.&P;  The Diconix device is almost alone among portable printers in
being truly usable on either trains or planes, but it's still more at home
working on a convenient, stationary tabletop.&M;

On readily available plain paper, the Diconix produced respectable- to
good-quality print.&P;  The characters in draft mode were a little faint, but
this was more than compensated for by the increased draft output speed.&P;  The
NLQ and Quality modes produced dark, attractive characters, but I
consistently noticed some wicking in plain paper use.&P;  Obviously, coated ink
jet paper produces truer letter-quality results, but special paper is just
one more thing to remember when you're running around on a series of sales
calls.&M;

A significant plus is the Diconix's use of readily available nickel-cadmium
batteries.&P;  All rechargeables fail eventually, and replacements for the
Diconix are as close as the nearest electronics or business supply store.&O;
That gives the Diconix an advantage over the Canon BJ-10e, which uses a
sealed, proprietary pack for batter operation.&M;

While the new Canon merits a hard look because of its excellent output
quality and optional sheet-feeder, the Diconix is noticeably smaller and
somewhat lighter.&P;  It also seems a bit more ruggedly constructed.&P;  For users
who must print on the go, the Diconix Model 150 Plus remains the machine of
choice.&O;

Color Page Printers Not so long ago, the phrases "high-quality color output"
and "affordable price" wouldn't apply to the same printer.&P;  That began
changing two years ago.&P;  And, a little over one year ago, there were enough
such affordable and high-quality printers that PC Magazine covered them in a
separate section of the 1989 printer issue (see "Color Page Printers:
Affordable At Last," November 14, 1989).&M;

Included in that 1989 overview were five printers from four
manufacturers--the Howtek Pixelmaster, the OMS ColorScript Model 10 and Model
30, the Seiko Instruments CH-5504-PS, and the Tektronix Phaser CP.&P;  All five
printers offered vibrant colors, with prices ranging from $8,245 to $15,995.&O;
And if the prices were high compared to a typical laser printer, they were
also low enough to be affordable for medium-duty business presentation needs.&M;

To make it into this roundup, printers had to be PC-compatible, print in
color, use PostScript, and, of course, arrive in time for our deadline and in
working condition.&P;  Four color thermal printers met these criteria--the NEC
Colormate PS, the OceColor, the QMS ColorScript 100 Model 10, and the
Tektronix Phaser PX.&P;  As a possible high-end alternative, we also reviwed the
Canon Laser Copier 500 (see the sidebar "The Canon Laser Copies 500: First of
Its Kind"), a $49,500, 602-pound monster capable of copying color images with
laser quality and upgradable (after a $30,000 dip into your wallet) to a true
color laser printer.&M;

Machines that didn't arrive in time were CalComp's announced ColorMaster Plus
and the Linotype Color Printer.&M;

STILL LOWER PRICES&M;

If you take the four printers reviewed here together, they establish a clear
trend.&P;  Prices range roughly between $8,000 and $10,000.&P;  Include the Seiko
ColorPoint PS 4, which we review in a pre-production version (see the sidebar
"The Seiko ColorPoint PS 4: Still in The Wings," for more information), and
the lowest price falls to around $7,000.&P;  All five printers use color thermal
transfer technology, as did most of the color printers in the 1989 printer
issue.&M;

Part of the reason for the lower prices in this roundup is that the five
printers are all limited to paper widths of roughly 8.5 inches, with some
variation to A4, A, and Super A sizes.&P;  The high-end price of $15,995 in the
1989 printer issue was for the QMS ColorScript Model 30, which handles 11- by
17-inch, B-size paper.&M;

Even so, much of the price difference is advantageous.&P;  For example, QMS's
Model 10, which we reviewed both in 1989 (when it won an Editors' Choice) and
again in this roundup, was essentially the same price in both reviews.&P;  But
in 1989, this PostScript printer provided an HPGL emulation only as an
option, and had only 4MB RAM standard at $9,995.&P;  In this roundup, the tested
unit's $9,990 price includes the HPGL emulation and 8MB RAM.&P;  What's more,
the 8MB configuration is an upgrade.&P;  The base price of the printer, with
HPGL and with 5MB RAM, is $8,995.&M;

Interestingly, the QMS Model 30 is still selling for $15,995.&P;  However, a new
version--the Model 30i--was recently announced along with the new Model 10
prices, at a list price of $12,995.&P;  According to QMS, the only changes in
the Model 30i are that it has an internal controller rather than the external
controller of the Model 30, and it offers a hard disk as an option rather
than including it standard.&M;

One other price difference worth noting is between last year's $8,245 Seiko
printer and this year's $6,999 Seiko, both of which use the same engine.&P;  Not
only is this year's version about $1,250 less expensive, but it includes
PostScript-compatibility in firmware, rather than providing it in a software
package.&P;  (And owners of the older CH-5504-PS can upgrade to the newer
ColorPoint PS 4 by buying the new controller and installing it in the
printer.)&M;

As a group, the current crop of printers offers more value for less money.&O;
As further economies of scale come into play, you can expect this downward
price trend to continue.&M;

EMERGING STANDARDS&M;

In addition to lower prices, the five thermal transfer printers show several
other trends.&P;  To start, color PostScript is now the undoubted standard for
high-quality color page printers.&P;  In our 1989 overview, all five printers
offered some form of a PostScript interpreter, but in two cases--the Seiko
CH-5504-PS and the Howtek Pixelmaster--the interpreter was a software utility
that translated PostScript into the printer's native command set.&M;

In this roundup, every thermal transfer printer includes some form of
built-in PostScript.&P;  Three printers--from QMS, NEC, and Oce Graphics--use
Adobe PostScript, Tektronix uses its own version of PostScript, and Seiko
uses Phoenix-Page.&M;

Another clearly established standard is Pantone simulation, primarily of
interest to graphic artists.&P;  Pantone Inc., of Carlstadt, New Jersey, and a
recognized giant in the color-graphics-rendering arena, created the Pantone
Matching System (a rigidly defined set of 736 colors) in 1963 to overcome
color fidelity problems in conventional color graphics printing.&P;  Because of
the limitations of the four-color printing process used by the printers
reviewed here, none of them can exactly match Pantone's system.&P;  And,
although all of them do offer Pantone-licensed simulations, each of these
varies slightly from printer to printer.&M;

All five thermal transfer printers offer 300-dpi resolution.&P;  And even though
they use different inks and different print engines, their output shows far
more similarity as a group than it shows differences from one printer to
another.&P;  As the individual reviews show, each printer we looked at produces
vibrant colors.&M;

Which printer produces the best color?&P;  As color researchers point out, it's
a truism that color preference is a highly individual issue, based on
personal biases.&P;  Significantly, when we compared the output from these
printers, we discovered that different people chose different print samples
as providing the best-looking colors.&P;  The differences are objectively real,
but the issue of best and worst is a matter of taste.&M;

In addition to the graphics standards of PostScript and Pantone simulation,
these five thermal transfer printers also suggest that standards are emerging
in connection and storage options.&P;  All five printers offer a parallel port,
serial port, an AppleTalk port, and a SCSI port to let you attach an external
hard disk for storing additional fonts.&P;  The Seiko printer also includes a
second SCSI port for connection to a computer.&M;

A GROWTH CURVE&M;

One other trend well worth noting is that the color printer market is both
growing and shifting.&P;  One measure of that growth is the new players getting
into the game.&P;  The NEC Colormate PS, for example, is NEC's first
high-quality color printer.&M;

More interesting is the way the market is segmented and how the importance of
these segments is changing.&P;  BIS CAP International projects separate growth
figures for each of three markets: engineering and scientific, graphics
artist, and office.&P;  The last category will generally translate to desktop
publishing and business presentation applications.&M;

The engineering and scientific market is the most mature and shows the least
growth (15,300 printers shipped in 1989, 17,300 expected in 1990, and 20,300
expected in 1993).&P;  The two other areas have been minor segments until
recently.&P;  The graphic arts market is still relatively small but growing
rapidly (2,500 shipped in 1989, 4,200 expected to ship in 1990, and 8,000 in
1993).&P;  The office market is far larger and growing faster than either of the
other segments (9,400 shipped in 1989, 13,900 expected to have shipped in
1990, and most significantly, 22,400 by 1993).&M;

So, by BIS CAP International's projections, business buyers of color
PostScript printers will outstrip engineering and scientif purchasers and
almost triple graphics acquisitions by 1993.&M;

Color printers are shifting from being a niche product to being a mainstream
business tool--for desktop publishing and for high-quality color
presentations.&P;  Not surprisingly, printer manufacturers are shifting their
focus as well--to issues that are most important to the business user.&P;  One
of the more interesting of these, though it's not addressed in the current
crop of printers, is matching colors between monitor and printer.&P;  As
high-quality color printers move increasingly into the office, color matching
will become more important.&M;

COLOR MATCHING&M;

The idea behind color matching is simple enough: extend the concept of
WYSIWYG to color as well as the shape and formatting of a page.&P;  But as David
Tait, Product Marketing Manager at Tektronix, points out, color matching is
only important for a certain class of users.&P;  Tait suggests that most
engineering and scientific users, as well as some business users, are
satisfied simply to have clearly distinguishable colors on both screen and
printout.&P;  Graphic artists, in contrast, care very much about getting precise
colors, but they already know how to make the translations between what they
see and what they expect to get.&M;

Tait says, and most observers agree, that even graphics artists would
appreciate WYSIWYG colors as a way to avoid unpleasant surprises for clients.&O;
But the lack of color matching is a problem primarily for the business user,
who is typically unsophisticated in the art and physics of color.&M;

Unfortunately, there are some fundamental technical problems involved in
colormatching.&P;  For example, we perceive colors different depending on the
background.&P;  So even if a screen color and printed color match exactly, they
will still appear different, since the white background on the screen won't
match the white background of the paper.&M;

Similarly, we perceive colors differently under different lighting
conditions.&P;  A particularly sticky issue is that color samples produced with
different technologies may match under one lighting condition--such as
daylight--but be obviously different under others--such as fluorescent
lights.&P;  That's why graphic artists generally view proofs under specific
standard lighting conditions.&M;

Another key problem is that each color device--including each monitor and
printer--has a specific set of colors it can produce.&P;  This set of colors,
called the color gamut, varies with several factors.&P;  One of the most
important is the set of base colors the device uses to create other colors.&M;

For example, monitors use the RGB color model, so called because it creates
colors by varying the levels of red, green, and blue on the screen.&P;  Printers
generally use either the CMY (cyan, magenta, yellow) or the related CMYK
(cyan, magenta, yellow, black) model.&P;  Since the RGB and CMYK models each
start with a different group of base colors, it's not surprising that the
color gamuts for monitors and printers differ significantly, though there is
substantial overlap.&M;

Even within a given color model, the color gamut will vary depending on the
specific colors in any given device.&P;  As already mentioned, each of the
printers reviewed here uses slightly different versions of the base colors.&O;
As a result, each one has a different color gamut, even though all of them
create colors with the CMYK model.&P;  In general, two printers of the same
model will have a closely matched color gamut, since both will use the same
base colors and same process for putting the ink on paper.&M;

Consistent color gamuts are far more problematic for monitors than for
printers.&P;  Not only do different manufacturers use different phosphors, but
even two monitors from the same production line may differ because of slight
variations in phosphor thickness or other normal manufacturing deviations.&O;
And the color gamut for any specific monitor will change as the phosphor
ages.&M;

What's more, a given set of RGB signal levels sent to a given monitor will
produce different colors depending on the setting for the brightness and
contrast controls.&P;  And, the same set of signals will yield one color when
the monitor is just turned on, and another when it's warmed up.&P;  As with
printed material, the perceived colors will even change depending on lighting
conditions.&M;

Given th relative predictability of printer colors compared to screen colors,
it's ironic that most people will blame the printer when printed colors don't
match the screen.&P;  But as Dale Richmond, Director of Marketing at Seiko
points out, that's exactly what happens.&P;  A secretary or executive will
carefully adjust the screen colors to taste, print the graphic, and then
blame the printer for not producing a match.&P;  Since it's perceived that the
printer is at fault, at least some printer manufacturers feel it's their job
to address the issue.&M;

Any color matching system has to at least do three things: First, it needs a
way to calibrate the monitor, so the system can create a database that
matches specific RGB signal levels to specific colors.&P;  Second, it needs a
database of printer colors that matches specific CMY or CMYK values to
specific colors.&P;  And third, it needs a completely objective,
device-independent way to describe colors in the first place, so the system
has a common language of "specific colors" to tanslate from RGB value to
color description to the CMY or CMYK value for the printer.&M;

Fortunately, it's not difficult to find an unambiguous color model.&P;  The
first was developed by the CIE (Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage or
the International Commission on Illuminations) in 1931.&P;  It has since been
updated, and now exists in several variations.&P;  Even better, the color
description in any variation can be translated to another by straightforward
mathematical formulas.&M;

Creating a database of printer colors is also reasonably simple.&P;  As already
mentioned, there is relatively little variation for individual printers.&O;
Manufacturers can easily supply a look-up table with each printer model, in
much the same spirit as a device driver.&M;

In fact, the trickiest part in all this is calibrating the monitor.&P;  There is
currently no practical way to do that in the DOS world, though there are a
few appropriate tools for the Macintosh.&P;  The basic approach is to attach a
clor sensor to the screen, typically by suction cup, and let the package run
through a set of RGB values, read the colors off the screen, and make
compensating adjustments to the video card.&M;

Given a way to describe colors objectively, a look-up table for your printer,
and the ability to calibrate a monitor, all that remains is to write software
that will handle the translation.&P;  Ideally, the software should also show you
the color gamuts of your printer and monitor, so you can compare the two, and
know when you're looking at a color on-screen that your printer simply cannot
produce.&M;

As of this writing, at least one complete color matching package--with screen
calibration, printer look-up table, and software--has been announced for the
Macintosh by SuperMac Technology, and we should be seeing similar packages
for DOS before too long.&P;  However, as Jim Forrest, Senior Marketing Manager
at NEC points out, color for the Macintosh i s two to three years ahead of
color for DOS.&P;  Part of the problem is that there are more video standards in
the DOS world to hlep complicate the issue.&P;  And, there is no single color
picker accessible to all DOS programs the way there is with the Mac.&P;  Windows
3.0 may help change that.&M;

One important step towards eventual color matching of screens with printers
is Adobe's announced PostScript Level 2.&P;  Among other things, Level 2 will
incorporate device-independent color description as part of PostScript.&O;
According to Adobe, we should be seeing the first Level 2 printers somewhere
between spring 1991 and spring 1992.&M;

Another notable development is that Tektronix has developed, and is actively
lobbying for, its own color matching system called TekColor.&P;  TekColor is an
open system.&P;  Tecktronix is not only wiling to license it, but according to
those who are discussing the issue with Tektronix, the company is asking
reasonable licensing fees.&M;

TekColor uses a color model developed by Tektronix.&P;  The model, called HVC,
defines each color by its hue (the color family, such as blue or green),
value (the variation between light and dark), and chroma (the degree of
saturation or vibrancy of the color).&P;  This HVC model is a variation on the
CIE models and according to Tektronix, dovetails nicely with PostScript Level
2.&M;

Significantly, QMS, NEC, Seiko, and Oce Graphics are all committed to
supporting PostScript Level 2, and all are at least tracking TekColor colsely
as a future possibility.&P;  However, NEC's Forrest, for example, worries that
TekColor's current implementation may be too limited to deal with the full
range of monitors and printers on the market.&P;  Not surprisingly, there is
also a bit of resistance to the TekColor name from companies that are, after
all, in competition with Tektronix.&M;

PICKING A PRINTER NOW&M;

Whatever the future of color matching, the reality is that it's not here
yet--at least not in the DOS world.&P;  And for the moment, the question is how
to choose a printer from those that exist right now.&P;  With such uniformly
gorgeous output, picking a printer won't be easy, unless you need some
special feature, such as the HPGL emulation that's only available in the QMS
and Tektronix printers.&P;  However, here are some issues you'll want to
consider when making your choice.&M;

One obvious question is whether you need true Adobe PostScript.&P;  If you plan
to produce boardroom-level graphics, presentation graphics, or other material
where the printed output will be your final product, any of these printers
will do the job.&P;  However, if you're looking to produce proofs for something
that will be printed in final form elsewhere, you may want to be more
conservative, and stay with Adobe PostScript.&M;

Be aware that text spacing, in particular, may vary between Adobe PostScript
and some other PostScript emulator.&P;  So if you hand a file to a print shop,
for example, you may find that lines break at a different spot on your proof
and on the final product.&P;  Only the NEC, QMS, and Oce Color printers offer
Adobe PostScript.&M;

Another basic issue is paper size.&P;  If you need a printer that handles B-size
paper, you can immediately narrow your search down to the QMS ColorScript
Model 30 (reviewed in the 1989 printer issue), the newly announced Model 30i
(QMS says it's essentially identical to the Model 30), and possibly the Seiko
ColorPoint PS 14.&P;  Although PC Labs hasn't tested the PS 14, Seiko says it's
basically a wide carriage version of the PS4 that we look at here in its
pre-production version (see sidebar "The Seiko ColorPoint PS4: Still in the
Wings," for more information).&M;

You'll also want to consider the maximum image size, as a separate issue from
the paper (or transparency) size.&P;  The nature of color printing, with the
need for a separate print pass for each color, puts a high premium on
registration, so that each color is printed in exactly the right place.&P;  The
only way to get that registration is for the printer mechanism to hold
tightly onto the paper--a procedure that creates relatively large margins for
machines that use cut sheets.&M;

The NEC, QMS, Tektronix, and Oce Graphics printers can all produce an image
that nearly fills a letter-size page, but only when using larger paper.&P;  For
letter size output, the image sizes for all these printers hover around 8 by
9 inches.&P;  The actual numbers are: 8 by 9 inches for the Colormate PS, 8.1 by
8.5 inches for the Phaser PX, 8.1 by 9 for the ColorScript 100 Model 10, and
8.2 by 9.3 for the OceColor.&M;

All four printers will also let you get larger images on larger paper.&P;  The
maximum sizes vary significantly, with the Phaser PX offering the smallest
maximum image size, at 8.1 by 10.8 inches on legal-size paper.&P;  Next in size
is the OceColor, with a maximum image of 8.2 by 11 inches, then the
ColorScript 100 Model 10, with a maximum 8.1 by 12 inches.&P;  As tested, the
NEC printer did not support legal-size paper, but according to NEC, by the
time this article is published, the firmware will be upgraded to allow 8.1-
by 12-inch images.&M;

If it's important to get the largest possible image size, you'll want to take
a careful look at the Seiko ColorPoint PS 4.&P;  The PS 4 uses roll paper
instead of cut sheets.&P;  This lets it hold the paper by a special printing
margin, then cut off the excess margin when it's done.&P;  The maximum image for
the Seiko printer on letter-size paper is an impressive 8.2 by 10.7 inches.&O;
The maximum image on Seiko's super-A size paper is a whopping 8.5 by 13
inches.&M;

Finally, in looking over the reviews, you'll see some noticeable differences
in graphics speed, ranging from 0.3 gppm to 0.6 gppm.&P;  Since speed is of no
dire consequence to a color page printer, these differences aren't important
enough to be primary factors in picking one printer over another.&P;  However,
once you've narrowed the field down to one or two possibilities, you may well
want to consider speed, along with price, as final differentiating factors.&O;
Also, we've included text speed because it's part of the standard battery of
tests we run on any printer.&P;  Even though text speed is relatively
unimportant in the color world, these numbers can still help you compare
these printers across product categories or merely serve as another deciding
factor in your selection process.&P;  In any case, whatever your needs for
high-quality color printing, you can't go far wrong with any of these
machines.&O;

THE CANON COLOR LASER COPIER 500: First of Its Kind It may at first seem odd
to find a copy machine in a PC Magazine printer article, but its inclusion
indicates how the lines of technology are blurring.&P;  The $49,000 Canon Color
Laser Copier 500 incorporates the latest in dry color reproduction
techniques, and is comprised of two distinct components: a scanner and a
printer, integrated to function as a copier.&P;  Combined with Canon's
Intelligent Processing Unit (IPU) and powered by any of an assortment of
third-party PC-based software, the CLC 500 becomes an incredible CMYK and RGB
color graphics environment.&M;

Performance specifications are impressive for a color copier: the engine is
rated to process 5 copies per minute (cpm) during four-color output on 8.5-
by cpm for three-color output on 8.5-by 11-inch paper.&P;  Ledger-size copies
drop that rate to 3 cpm and the imaging area is the same as the paper
size--less 8 millimeters on the leading edge and 2 mm.&P;  on the remaining
sides.&M;

The scanner includes the opticals needed to read in the image and also
contains a digitizing tablet and stylus built into the top cover.&P;  The
stylus, the small control console recessed under a sliding panel, and the 2-
by 4-inch LCD touch-sensitive screen indicate that the CLC 500 is more than
just another color copier.&M;

To extend the CLC 500 to the realm of PC's, you'll need to add the $10,500
IPU, which is essentially a host interface that provides communication back
and forth between the copier and your PC via a GPIB-488 connection.&P;  More
than that, the IPU also becomes the holding area for in-process graphics.&O;
Sufficient memory, however, typically means endowing the IPU with its maximum
of four 6MB memory boards--a total of $33,000 in all.&M;

You'll pay between $1,000 and $15,000 for the privilege of manipulating
sophisticated graphic images on your PC.&P;  At the very heart of all the
software is the ability to duplicate the CLC 500's control panel functions
from your computer; but, things go further than that.&M;

Texni/Laser Today's FBX Studio Set/AT ($12,500) is a windowing program that
works with bitmapped IPU images in small segments.&P;  You have complete
maneuverability to reach, modify, and enhance every pixel, but you lose the
large picture view until you print it.&P;  Wasatch's Portfolio ($8,495), aimed
more at the graphic designer than the graphic artist, uses a combination of
vector and raster techniques to simulate the huge bitmapped image.&P;  There is
a small degradation in visual quality on screen, but the integrity of the
image is maintained when printed.&P;  Alternately, Freedom of the Press ($2,990)
from Custom Applications Inc. translates PostScript images into
Canon-compatible color output.&P;  The finished product is extremely well done
and the driver they designed specifically for the CLC 500 is a $1,495
component of the package price.&P;  Further down the low-end, Digistat he
Connection 500 ($2,000) to help integrate desktop publishing with the CLC
500.&M;

The sophistication of the CLC 500 requires a stable environment with low
humidity.&P;  It also needs a dedicated, regulated AC line because line voltage
fluctuations can cause variations in color output.&P;  Because the CLC 500 is
nearly 90 percent electronic and 100 percent new, service may not be what you
expect for an $83,050 piece of equipment.&P;  The technicians themselves are
still in learning mode and you may be forced into a few concessions,
especially if you expect a 1:1 color correspondence between the original and
the copy.&P;  Physically, it's simply not possible given the variety of color
mixing systems in use.&P;  Even if you acquiesce to a best-effort result, it may
take several service calls to Canon before the machine finally settles down
to even that level of performance.&M;

At its price level, the best application, of course, would be to assign the
CLC 500 as a network resource.&P;  But, if you've ever stood in line waiting to
make a copy, you'll begin to appreciate the potential nightmare of a shared
network device where the original is removable from the scanner.&M;

Even with all of that, the Canon Color Laser Copier 500 presents such a new
level of graphics facility that it can easily let one person do the work of
three.&P;  And the output, despite small variations in hue for some color
assignments, is unanimously applauded.&P;  The CLC 500 may not be the next
graphics printer you purchase, but it will certainly be its progenitor.&O;

THE SEIKO COLORPOINTS PS 4: Still in the Wings At the last possible moment,
Seiko Instruments Inc. sent us the newly announced ColorPoint PS Model 4.&O;
Almost too late for our regular deadline, the printer turned out to be a
pre-production unit, which we ordinarily wouldn't cover, even though it only
lacked a final ROM upgrade.&P;  However, after seeing the brilliant colors and
300-dpi output from this PostScript-compatible printer along with some unique
capabilities beyond even some of its higher-priced competition, we felt that
it deserved more than passing mention--especially given the $6,999 price,
about $1,000 lower than the next least-expensive choice.&M;

Built around Seiko's own CH5500-series thermal transfer engine, the PS 4
offers PostScript-compatibility by way of PhoenixPage, from Phoenix
Technologies.&P;  The Phoenix version of PostScript seems to work well enough:
The printer sailed through the PC Labs compatibility test without complaint.&O;
As you would expect, the 35 built-in Bitstream fonts match the usual Adobe
PostScript offerings.&P;  According to Seiko, the printer will accept Type 1 and
Type 3 fonts as well.&M;

The Seiko engine is rated at about 1 ppm with the three-color ink sheet and
tested only a little slower for text speed, at 0.86 ppm.&P;  On the
more-significant graphics speed test, the PS 4 managed 0.35 gppm.&P;  Although
that's only half the speed of some other printers in this category, it's will
within an acceptable range.&M;

More important than speed is the color quality, which is brilliant.&P;  As is
typical of three-color printing, black and white images have a sepia tinge,
except where the black is solidly filled in.&P;  Text is well formed and
suitably black, making it acceptable for labels on a color image.&P;  If your
output includes gray shades, however, you'll want to use the four-color ink
sheet, with its added black ink.&P;  The production model will also include
Pantone-licensed software with printer-specific recipes for three- and
four-color Pantone simulations.&M;

Prices for the ink sheets are $70 for a 176-image, three-color roll and $62
for a 123-image, four-color roll.&P;  The price per image works out to about 40
cents for the three-color roll, and about 50 cents for the four color.&P;  A $70
monochrome ribbon yields 600 images, at 11.7 cents per image.&M;

The Seiko engine is notable for using roll paper.&P;  This gives it plenty of
extra paper to hold onto, without needing large top and bottom margins on the
final product.&P;  When the printer finishes the last pass, it cuts off the
excess top margin, then cuts off the excess top end result of this feature is
a larger image area than with most printers in this category.&M;

The paper rolls come in three widths, yielding letter-, A4-, or A Super-size
(8.8 by 15-inch) formats.&P;  The claimed maximum image size is 8.5 by 13 inches
for the A Super format.&P;  The image on letter-size paper, as measured on PC
Labs' edge to edge test, is a remarkably large 8.2 by 10.7 inches.&O;
Transparency rolls come in letter and A4 sizes only.&P;  It's also worth noting
that Seiko has announced a $9,999 ColorPoint PS 14, which is essentially a
wide-carriage version of the PS 4 able to print on B-size (11- by 17-inch)
paper.&P;  This presents some wonderful presentation spreadsheet and graphics
possibilities.&M;

Like other printers in this category, the ColorPoint PS 4 has multiple
connectors--for parallel, serial, SCSI, and AppleTalk connections.&P;  All are
active simultaneously, so you can plug in a PC and a Mac, for example, and
print from either one without having to change settings.&P;  The printer also
has a second SCSI connector to allow room for a hard disk to store additional
fonts.&P;  However, Seiko does not currently sell a drive.&P;  The only options are
for memory upgrades above the standard 6MB--at prices from $1,000 for a 4MB
upgrade to $8,200 for 28MB.&P;  Maximum RAM is a remarkable 34MB.&M;

Setup is straightforward.&P;  Aside from plugging in the cable, or cables, you
only have to load the ink sheet and paper roll, a procedure that's clearly
explained in the manual.&P;  The 22 buttons on the front panel look daunting,
but if you need to change settings, the 16-character LCD gives understandable
responses.&P;  The manual also clearly explains the menus.&M;

The pre-production ROM was missing some features, including the ability to
print test images.&P;  Also, the printer crashed occasionally, forcing us to
turn it off and on to get it working again.&P;  When we called Seiko, the
company traced the crashes to a faulty ROM burner, rather than any inherent
problem in the firmware itself.&M;

All told, the ColorPoint PS 4 promises to be a better-than-average value.&O;
The only problems that showed up on PC Labs' tests are the sort of glitches
that you would expect to encounter in a pre-production unit.&P;  The bottom line
here: At $6,999 the ColorPoint PS 4 brings PostScript-compatible, thermal
transfer color printing to an even more affordable price.&O;

NEC Technologies Inc. NEC Technologies has entered the color page printer
market with a new PostScript printer that carries the same $8,995 list price
as its close competitor, the QMS ColorScript 100 Model 10.&P;  The new NEC
machine is equivalent to the QMS printer in many other ways as well.&M;

The Colormate PS is built around a NEC print engine that uses thermal
transfer technology with 300-dpi resolution.&P;  You can get black, three-color
or four-color ink rolls, with per-page costs that are typical for the class:
$0.18 for black, $0.42 for three-color, and $0.60 for four-color.&P;  You'll
find the ink rolls are extremely easy to install, and changing ribbons is a
snap, especially since the Colormate PS automatically senses which ribbon has
been installed.&M;

The controller comes with 8MB of memory as standard.&P;  The true Adobe
PostScript includes the full complement of 35 scalable font outlines.&P;  The
printer was able to print text at a 2.8-page-per-minute (ppm) rate with the
black ribbon, and produce our graphics image in 0.5 graphics pages per minute
(gppm), just slightly slower than the QMS times.&P;  The Colormate PS offers a
complete range of connectors--parallel, serial, and Apple-Talk--as well as a
SCSI port for an optional hard disk that you can use to store downloaded
fonts and images.&M;

While you can use plain paper in the printer, you'll want to use special
paper for best results.&P;  The print samples were crisp and vivd.&P;  NEC does not
claim Pantone certification for its color output, but instead chooses to say
that it can simulate that colors when using a Pantone-certified application
program.&P;  We printed sample Pantone colors and found that while the Colormate
PS output was close, there were some obvious differences when the printer
produced lighter shades.&M;

The printer is a cinch to setup.&P;  The interface is selected using the buttons
on the simple front panel, and your choices are guided by a 16-character LCD
display.&P;  There are no DIP switches, and aside from plugging in the power and
interface cables in the back, you can setup and run the printer conveniently
from the front.&P;  Even the power switch is conveniently located on the side of
the unit, where it can be reached without any difficulty.&M;

Paper is loaded in a vertical bin that can hold up to 80 sheets of paper at a
time.&P;  The Colormate PS cannot take legal-size sheets; it accepts only
letter- or A4-size pages.&P;  The output arrives faceup in another vertical
tray, and NEC provides a "privacy cover" that keeps your pages covered and
hidden from the more curious eyes in the office.&M;

The Colormate PS is going to make the color PostScript page printer market
more interesting than it's ever been.&P;  Given the fact that many NEC products
are heavily discounted on the street, this printer may well produce strong
pressure to lower prices in this class.&P;  The Colormate PS is missing some of
the features found on its QMS competition, but most users will find it
equally well suited for most tasks--clearly a strong contender for the top
spot in affordable color output.&O;

Oce Graphics USA Inc. Oce Graphics could remake an old saying into: "If you
can join 'em, beat 'em too."&P;  Originally released at $10,990, Oce
significantly dropped the list price on its OceColor PostScript thermal
transfer printer to $8,990--a move that brought the company's guns to bear on
QMS' similarly priced ColorScript 100.&M;

Ignore the sculptured contours of the OceColor's case and you'll find that
the printer occupies a 16- by 17.5-inch (WD) patch of desktop real estate.&O;
You'll need an additional 6 inches to account for the length of the installed
100-page paper tray and air rights cover 10 inches from the ground up.&O;
OceColor uses one of the most stylized cases ever to arrive at PC Labs.&P;  A
curved hood fills out the machine's top rear two thirds; this structure is
not just for show because it houses the supply and take-up rolls for the
OceColor's was transfer ribbon.&M;

There is function to the rest of this case as well.&P;  At the rear, connectors
are provided for parallel, serial, and AppleTalk interfaces,  A one-line,
16-character LCD display prints error messages as well as the list of
hierarchical menu options that cover the printer's functions, including
interface type and manual versus cassette feed.&P;  And, unlike the stark LED
panels of many PostScript color printers, all of the OceColor's functions are
programmable from the outside via its eight control buttons.&M;

Deeper into the printer you'll find a 300-dpi 5 ppm laser engine powered by a
68020 processor running at 16.8 MHz and rated at a remarkable 120,000-page
life.&P;  PostScript version 50.3 was resident in the reviewed machine's 1MB of
ROM and 5MB of RAM was used to handle the programming chores, imaging, and
any downloaded fonts (Adobe Type 1 compatible).&P;  You have the option of
expanding the OceColor's memory to 8MB if your imaging chores are immense
enough to require it.&M;

Don't be fooled by the 5-ppm rating.&P;  Despite the full compliment of 35 Adobe
outline typefaces, the OceColor is not a text printer by any means.&P;  In fact,
Oce Graphics doesn't even supply a black ribbon for the machine.&P;  If you
decide that you must print text pages, you'll do so with process black, the
result of several passes under a three- or four-color ribbon, and you'll do
it at only 1.3 pages per minute according to PC Labs' text speed test.&P;  While
this speed is relatively fast among color printers, it's slower than any
low-end 4-ppm laser printer.&P;  With the three-color ribbon rated at 100 pages
per roll and the four-color ribbon carrying an 80-page-per-roll limit, text
printing also becomes expensive; you'll find it's more cost effective to add
any $1,000 4-ppm laser printer for text chores.&M;

If the OceColor was designed to do graphics then the design was well done.&O;
Under the influence of PC Labs' graphic speed test it reached a respectable
0.6 gppm average speed for the two pages of graphic output.&P;  More so than
speed, visual quality is important and here too the OceColor is simply
superb.&P;  Although there was some sepia tinting in the black and white gray
scale, the bitmapped image contained only whites, grays, and blacks.&P;  The
OceColor's output also had a remarkable amount of detail for a 300-dpi print.&M;

In the color wars between PMS, CMYK, and RGB standards, OceColor has
surrendered to the Pantone matching system used by offset printers.&P;  Given
software that supports PMS color output, the OceColor will give you reliable
originals.&P;  Oce Graphics even includes a utility to print a PMS color chart
with Pantone recipes.&M;

The one possible fault one can find with the Oce Graphics printer is that it
will not handle ledger-sized sheets.&P;  Instead, the normal 8.5- by 11-inch
paper cassette doubles as a Letter+-size cassette that will fit special 8.5-
by 12.7-inch sheets available from the company.&P;  Standard letter-size paper
permits an 8.2- by 9.3-inch image area while the Letter+ size gives you
enough room to successfully print an 11-inch long picture.&M;

The manual accompanying the unit is well done, despite being evenly divided
between the Macintosh and PC platforms.&P;  The printer produces excellent
graphics, the colors are brilliant, and the price is at or below that of most
competitive color printers.&P;  The OceColor printer is as good as the genre
gets.&O;

QMS Inc. In last year's Printer Project, the QMS ColorScript 100 Model 10
took home Editors' Choice honors, in large part because it provided true
Adobe PostScript support in full color while breaking through the $10,000
price barrier.&P;  This year the printer is back with the same $8,995 list
price, also with a range of new features.&M;

The most important change is a doubling of the installed memory for the
printer, from 4MB to 8MB.&P;  This extra memory makes room for a larger font
cache and more space for downloaded fonts.&P;  The extra RAM appears to give the
printer a significant performance boost as well.&P;  Text speeds were only
slightly faster, but on the more-important graphics speed test, this year's
Model 10 was more than a third faster than last year: about 0.6 gppm to print
our graphics image.&M;

QMS has thrown in a few other goodies to sweeten the pot.&P;  The printer now
comes with a free legal-size four-color ink roll, and four-color legal-size
rolls have been reduced in price so the per-page cost is the same as for the
letter-size rolls--$0.62 per page not including the paper.&P;  Rolls come
two-to-the-pack, and you can get 85 pages from a letter-size roll, or 70 from
a legal-size roll.&P;  You can get black-only rolls in either size (per page
costs are better for the letter-size at $0.18 compared with $0.21 for the
legal-size), or a three-color roll in the letter-size (which comes in at
$0.53 per page.)&P;  You also need to use special paper for best results.&M;

QMS has bundled an HPGL emulation with the printer that used to cost $199 as
an option.&P;  This is a disk-based emulation that gets downloaded to the
printer.&P;  We didn't test this feature, but it may be useful for printing
charts from programs that offer plotter support but not PostScript.&M;

QMS has also increased confidence in the 300-dpi thermal-transfer Mitsubishi
print engine.&P;  The rated duty cycle for the printer has been raised to 3,000
pages per month, up from 1,200.&P;  And the warranty has been increased by the
company to a full year.&M;

By and large, the printer maintains its other attractive features.&P;  It has
parallel, serial, and Apple Talk interface ports.&P;  There is a SCSI port as
well, which can be connected to an external hard disk as storage for
downloaded fonts and images.&P;  There is a color separation switch which allows
you to print black images of each of the four-color images that make up a
printout; the four images can then be use to create printing plates for color
printing processes.&P;  The printer is fairly easy to set up and get running,
though installing and changing ribbons requires a few more steps than other
designs.&M;

Further, the printer is Pantone certified, and even comes with a utility that
prints out 36 pages showing more than 700 Pantone colors.&P;  Most of the colors
are created using dithered patterns, and while the matches are quite good for
the darker shades, some of the Model 10 output appeared too dark or off-color
compared with certain lighter Pantone colors.&P;  Still, the colors are quite
true and the output should be useful as color proofs for all but the msot
discerning eyes.&M;

QMS executives presumably decided that it was better to keep the printer's
price stable, and increase value by adding features.&P;  Now that the
under-$10,000 PostScript color-printer race is getting a bit more crowded, we
already see competition bringing prices down.&P;  The ColorScript 100 Model 10
is much improved over last year's winning design, but there are newcomers
already charging to knock it off the top of the hill.&O;

<TEXT>

Tektronix Inc. Last year, the big news in color printers was the QMS
ColorScript 100 Model 10, the first color PostScript printer under $10,000.&O;
This year, the price breakthrough is old hat, as demonstrated by the Phaser
PX from Tektronix Inc.&P;  With a list price of only $7,995, the Phaser PX is
not only Tektronix's lowerst price PostScript-compatible color printer, it's
getting dangerously close to being truly affordable.&M;

Built around a custom engine manufactured by Sharp, the Phaser PX offers
300-dpi resolution, brilliant color output, and Tektronix's own color
PostScript-compatible interpreter as well as an HPGL mode.&P;  As an added
bonus, the printer is Pantone certified.&M;

On PC Labs' tests, the printer was just a bit slower than its rated speed,
with a text speed of 1.27 ppm with a three-color roll.&P;  As expected, graphics
speed was far slower, coming in at 0.29 gppm.&P;  But, of course, as with any
color graphics printer, the output quality is far more important than the
speed.&M;

As already indicated, the color output is nothing short of gorgeou, with
brilliant color at 300-dpi resolution.&P;  This proved tru for transparencies as
well as for output on thermal transfer paper.&P;  The black and white graphics
are notable for crisp, clean lines and solid areas filled in with an even
black.&P;  The scanned-in photo retains all the requisite detail and shading on
both thermal transfer paper and transparencies.&M;

Text is generally in the same league as graphics, with only a few notable
exceptions.&P;  On PC Labs' fonts and features test, for example, the Courier
upper-case "C" consistently printed with a jagged notch, as did the
lower-case "d."&P;  Interestingly, these problems seem confined to the Courier
fonts.&P;  At least, they didn't show up in any of the other fonts we
tested--including Times Roman, Helvetica, and Palintino.&M;

The Tektronix version of PostScript is notable for printing out a status page
on our test, unlike many PostScript clones.&P;  The primer comes with a full
suite of 36 typefaces, and--according to Tektronix--can accept Type 1 and
Type 3 downloadable fonts.&M;

Setting up the Phaser PX is simple enough, thanks to a fold-out page entitled
"Installing the Printer."&P;  The only tricky part is loading the enclosed
three-color transfer roll.&P;  However, afte installing it once, you shouldn't
have any trouble on subsequent attempts.&M;

Two notable features are the printer's ability to connect to three different
computers through its serial port, parallel port, and Apple Talk port, and
its automatic queuing of print jobs to the limit of its memory.&P;  You can also
use a disk-based setup program to set the Phaser PX so that one port will
default to HPGL mode, while another defaults to PostScript mode.&P;  Using the
printer is trivial, since there are no controls.&P;  Simply load your software,
and install it for color PostScript.&P;  A Microsoft Windows 3.0
page-description file for the Phaser PX comes on-disk.&M;

One mirror problem we ran into on the fonts and features test was that with
letter-size paper the printer lost 1.5 lines of text at the top.&P;  The large
margin is a result of the rollers that have to maintain accurate registration
as the page passes through the printer multiple times.&P;  tektronix says that
you can get a full 8.5-by 11-inch image by using legal-size paper.&P;  And
indeed, when we tried the test with the larger paper, the top line and a half
appeared on the page as promised.&M;

Legal-size paper is the largest the printer can handle.&P;  A nice touch is that
the one tray can adjust for either legal- or letter-size.&P;  Capacity is 100
sheets of thermal transfer paper, or 50 sheets of transparencies.&P;  Cost per
page--including the paper or transparency--varies from $0.18 per page when
using a black ribbon on letter-size paper to $1.74 per page for the
four-color ribbon on a legal-size transparency.&P;  With a legal-size page, the
cost is $0.57 per page for a four-color ribbon, or $0.46 per page for a
three-color ribbon.&P;  The only option for the printer is a $1,500 memory
upgrade from 6MB to 10MB.&M;

Tektronix stresses that the Phaser PX is aimed primarily at producing
transparencies and boardroom-level graphics, and, from what we've seen, the
printer can definitely fill that need.&P;  Significantly, at $7,995, the Phaser
PX has a lower list price than either of its most obvious competitors--the
QMS ColorScript 100 Model 10 and the NEC Colormate PS.&P;  It remains to be seen
if that list price will translate to the lowest street price, but hte Phaser
PX is certainly a contender.&M;

12-volt power alternative, and can be used with several cellular
telephone RJ-11 interfaces.&P;  The ITC laptop is rated for 2,400-bps
transmission, but when evaluated it only performed at 1,200-bps.&O;
The cost of the laptop is too much for those only interested in

Three Cellular Modems&M;

With some cellular telephones costing less than $200 in the United States,
yuppies and Hollywood celebrities aren't the only people yakking away over
the airwaves.&P;  About 5.5 to 5.7 million subscribes will be using cellular
systems throughout the United States by the end of 1990, estimates Herschel
Shosteck, an economist specializing in the cellular industry.&P;  By 1995, says
Shosteck, the figure will be between 18 and 22 million people.&M;

InfoCorp, a company that monitors trends in the computer industry, estimates
that 2 million IBM-compatible portable computers--85 percent of them battery
powered--were in use at the end of 1989.&P;  Projections indicate that the
portable computer market as well is likely to triple by 1995, suggesting that
the growth of the two technologies is intertwined.&P;  It's a good bet that many
people using portable computers will also subscribed to cellular telephone
service.&M;

But despite the sales spurt in cellular systems, few of the millions of
subscribers are currently using the airwaves for data transmission.&P;  Sales
figures of modems designed specifically for cellular technology show that
only some 15,000 people are transmitting and receiving data over cellular
networks.&M;

One reason is a lack of marketing push by cellular carriers.&P;  Cellular system
vendors are doing so well selling voice services that they have no need to
concentrate marketing efforts on data transmission.&P;  And although many
carriers are interested in potential data applications, they haven't seen
much of a demand for them yet--nor have they spent much time looking at the
data market.&M;

Also, moving data over cellular systems isn't as simple as it might seem, or
ought to be.&P;  Indeed, after weeks of experimentation at PC LAN Labs, we think
that setting up a cellular data system is a task you won't want to tackle
without expert help.&P;  Besides needing cumbersome, specialized interface
devices, you'll have to decide between very different proprietary modem
architectures and deal with a wide variety of problems concerning the time of
day, location, type of telephone, type of carrier, and even the type of
antenna you use to send data.&P;  The bottom line is that although you can
configure a system to move data over a cellular phone link and have it work
well, you'll either need help from an experienced local company or will
undergo a lot of frustration getting things to work.&M;

CELLULAR LINEUP&M;

In this review, we examine three cellular communications options: the $4,363
laptop, ITC 386 PEP, with an integrated cellular modem from Intelligence
Technology Corp., the under-$2,000 cellular modem pair (C96 and M96) marketed
by Microcom Inc., and the $1,245 CellBlazer made by Telebit Corp.&M;

Spectrum Cellular, the first company to offer a cellular modem, is missing
from our lineup because of inconvenient timing.&P;  Spectrum is in the process
of changing its product line and was unable to send us any new equipment for
this review, but it did give us a great deal of advice and insight.&P;  Spectrum
has been working with Rockwell International on the chip set for a new
internal 2,400-bit-per-second cellular modem in Toshiba's laptop line.&O;
Expected to be available as an option by late 1990, it will have built-in
error-correcting protocols including SPCL, MNP 5, V.22, V.22bis, V.42, and
V.42bis.&M;

Also missing from this lineup is the Cellmodem 2400 Plus from Cellabs of
Canoga Park, California.&P;  The Cellmodem has send-only fax capabilities,
supports MNP 5, and retails for $595.&M;

THE TRUTH ABOUT PORTABILITY&M;

If you want to transfer data over a cellular system, the type of phone you
buy is an important consideration.&P;  In-vehicle phones and transportable
phones (which weigh about 4 to 8 pounds) operate at a maximum of 3 watts;
some even have an RJ-11 jack built in.&P;  Portable phones (which weigh between
12 and 22 ounces) operate at 6 watts.&P;  But many of the phones you can buy,
especially the smaller-size portables, do not and will not have a way to
interface to a modem or fax machine.&M;

The one thing that manufacturers of cellular data communications products
seem to have in common is their lack of understanding of the working
environment.&P;  Normally, when you think of cellular devices, your picture
small, portable, battery-operated products.&P;  But the unpleasant truth is that
equipment needed for cellular data transmission tends to be so large as to be
difficult to install in any vehicle smaller than a van and requires more
cables and connectors than a local area network.&P;  One rare exception is
Motorola's The Cellular Connection, but it works only with specific Motorola
telephones.&M;

The Microcom and Telebit modems are each larger than any existing cellular
telephone.&P;  These two modems were not designed to be conveniently mobile.&O;
The CellBlazer, with its own power supply and a much-needed third-party 12-
to 120-volt AC converter, weighs nearly 8 pounds--more than many laptops
these days.&P;  Microcom's M96 could stand to go on a diet, as well.&M;

One interim solution is on its way to market.&P;  Eagle Cross in Chicago,
Illinois (312-247-8222) is about to ship a completely self-contained unit
named OutBack.&P;  OutBack consists of a Motorola cellular phone, Motorola's The
Cellular Connection, and a Telebit CellBlazer modem.&P;  OutBack weighs only 9
pounds total and powers itself from one of three sources: 110-volt AC,
12-volt DC, or rechargeable batteries.&P;  It also includes a switch for
operation from a standard telephone line.&P;  With this product, you trully have
a one-piece walking cellular communications station.&M;

CONNECTING TO CELLULAR PHONES&M;

On average, street prices range from about $400 to $600 for an in-vehicle, or
transportable, phone and from $500 to $800 for a portable.&P;  But buying the
phone is only the first decision--and the easiest.&M;

If you think that finding a hotel room with an RJ-11 jack is difficult, try
finding a cellular phone that has one.&P;  A few invehicle and transportable
cellular phones may come with one, but at present no portable phones do.&P;  If
you do have one, however, then you have a "dumb" dial-it-yourself interface
and might not need anything smarter.&M;

Smart connectors, on the other hand, have auto-answer and auto-dial
capabilities that let your communications software dial a remote computer
automatically; they are sold as external black boxes.&P;  The dumb versions,
which also are available as separate devices, make you use the handset's
touchpad to dial out.&P;  (For more on smart connectors, see the sidebar "The
Portable RJ-11.")&M;

Telular Inc. (Wilmette, Illinois; 708-256-8000), has a patent for its smart
CelJack, which retails for $480.&P;  Motorola's Cellular Subscriber Group
(Arlington Heights, Illinois; 708-576-0537), has licensed the use of
Telular's technology for a similar product that it calls The Cellular
Connection and sells for $395.&P;  And Cellabs (Canoga Park, California;
818-773-202) sells its Datajack, a dumb interface, for $145.&M;

Several cellular equipment manufacturers market the Datajack under their own
labels.&P;  To use Cellabs' interface, you plug your modem's RJ-11 cable into
the Datajack's RJ-11 jack.&P;  Then you unplug the coiled cord connecting the
cellular phone's handset to the cradle and, in its place, attach the
Datajack's cables to the handset and cradle.&P;  The Datajack uses the power
from the cellular phone.&M;

Telular's CelJack is a little more complicated to install because of the
power connections.&P;  There are two choices.&P;  TRhe easiest is to run it from
your vehicle's cigarette lighter: Buy a cigarette lighter plug adapter for a
few dollars and connect the CelJack to it.&P;  If, however, you already run your
telephone from the lighter socket, you'll need a special (and very ugly)
double-ended power adapter.&P;  Alternatively, you can open the cellular
transceiver and tap into the phone's positive batter connection to power the
CelJack.&P;  It doesn't take long, but it's not a job for someone unfamiliar
with electronics.&M;

HANDHELD PHONES&M;

Until recently, people who wanted to use handheld phones for data
transmission were out of luck, except for those brave souls who tried
acoustical coupling.&P;  Soon, however, interfaces will be available for two
such modesl: the NEC P300 and the Novatel PTR800/800A portable phones.&M;

Spectrum Cellular (800-233-2119), a Dallas, Texas-based company that markets
its own 1,200-bps modem featuring its proprietary SPCL error-correcting
protocol for cellular data transmission, has acted in conjunction with these
two companies to develop products that work with their phones.&P;  The
NEC/Spectrum interface snaps onto the back and bottom of the P300 and
incorporates an RJ-11 port, as well as connections for both a tape recorder
and a phone headset.&P;  NEC even has a smart and dumb version scheduled for
late 1990.&M;

In contrast, Novatel sees a much greater demand for using a cellular modem
with a facsimile machine than with a laptop computer.&P;  Hence it has developed
the Novatel Faxer, which as a dumb interface that includes an RJ-11 port and
connects to the phone's audio bus, to use with its PTR 800 and 800A.&M;

CELLULAR SYSTEMS&M;

For all the hype about the high quality of cellular voice calls, the reality
is that on average, the quality is not as good as on regular telephone lines.&O;
The same holds true for data transmission.&P;  Many factors affect the quality
of the radio signals, including hand-off--the signal transfer routine unique
to cellular systems (see the diagram "How Cellular Communications Work").&O;
Hand-offs are a major factor in determining the throughput and reliability of
a data or fax transmission; within a cellular system, they can occur at any
time.&M;

The extra noise, the limited bandwidth, the rapid fade, and the hand-offs are
all factors that can make the cellular system connection a difficult path for
data and fax modem communications.&P;  It's not an impossible task, though.&M;

FAXING ON THE ROAD&M;

Faxing documents with a portable fax machine or portable fax card often works
better over cellular telephones than sending land-line modem data because the
Group III fax protocol was originally designed to work over poor-quality
phone lines around the world.&P;  However, the protocol lacks error correction,
so you could lose some data.&P;  But unlike in orinary binary file transfers, if
the fax document transmission loses some bits, the end result is still
readable.&M;

Depending on the type of data interface you select, faxing from your vehicle
can be as easy as it is in the office.&P;  With a smart data interface, your fax
machine will auto-dial/send and auto-answer/receive just like at your office.&O;
With a dumb data interface, you place the call with the cellular phone and
connect with the remote fax, then hit the Start/Send button on your fax
machine to send.&P;  When transmission is complete, terminate the call with your
cellular phone's End button.&P;  To receive a fax, you simply answer the call
with the cellular phone's Send button and hit the Start/Send button on the
fax machine.&M;

Faxing is far more common over cellular phones than data transfer.&P;  Many
companies offer products to do the job.&P;  Portable fax machine vendors
included Fujitsu (800-243-7046), Mitshubishi (708-860-4200), Medbar
(718-335-0404), and Nissei (201-768-1520).&P;  These products operate on their
own batteries or a cigarette lighter adapter.&M;

Faxing on the go is simple; reading the rolled up pieces of paper while
driving is dangerous.&P;  But until people become more comfortable with
computers, they will continue to use fax machines to communicate.&P;  As
microcomputer and communications technology advances, cellular faxes will
help bring about the portable office.&P;  Before long, for example, our car
might call a local repair shop to order a worn-out part and schedule an
appointment without our help.&M;

MODEM CHOICES&M;

Despite the difficulties of cellular communications, you still might be able
to make do with a typical V.22bis 2,400-bps modem and a communications
package designed for use with terrestrial telephone lines.&P;  It depends on
your requirements for reliability, your location, and your tolerance for
frustration.&M;

In areas where you get a strong cellular signal, the difference in power
output between transportables and portables doesn't matter much.&P;  But at the
fringes of cellular coverage, the amount of higher power available makes all
the difference between a successful data file transfer and no transfer at
all.&M;

If you need to use a cellular telephone for data transmission in a specific
area where the signal strength is good and your cellular phone can accept
transmission speeds of 1,200 bps or 300 bps with even slower effective
throughput, then you can use standard modems and communications software over
the cellular link.&P;  We strongly suggest using modems with MNP 5 or V.42
error-correction capabilities.&P;  We also recommend using communications
software with a robust file-transfer protocol such as Kermit for the file
transfer sessions.&M;

The only trick to using a standard modem on the cellular line is to send the
Hayes command ATS10=12 to the modem to tell it to wait 1,200 milliseconds
before declaring a lost carrier.&P;  This time delay ensures that the modem will
stay connected during a cell hand-off.&P;  You might want to increase the =12 to
an even higher number in areas where you experience strong fading of signals.&M;

For other situations, you'll do much better by shelling out several hundred
dollars more for modems and software designed specifically for cellular
operation, such as those offered by Cellabs, ITC, Mircocom, Spectrum
Cellular, and Telebit.&P;  Microcom and Telebit have enhanced their existing
land-line protocols and market their modems for harsh radio and telephone
line environments, not just for cellular use.&M;

Products from these companies must cope with the vagaries of transmitting
over the air by using such techniques as increasing or decreasing the
transmission speed, changing the size of the data packets, and making many
attempts to overcome transmission interference during the initial connect
stage when the signal is most likely to be dropped.&P;  They also feature data
compression, ranging from ratios of 2:1 to 4:1, which can dramatically
increase throughput.&M;

It's no surprise to find that the best test results are seen when each
company's proprietary error-correcting protocol is used.&P;  To take full
advantage of these protocols, it's necessary to buy two modems: one for the
host and one for the remote computer.&P;  However, since so many cellular
operators have installed Spectrum's modems at their cellular management
centers, the SPCL cellular protocol can be used over the radio channels
between the laptop's cellular modem and the switching office.&P;  Hence, if you
decide to purchase a Spectrum Cellular modem, you might need only the one for
your laptop.&M;

Without another SPCL modem at the host computer, transmission over regular
telephone lines between the cell site and the host computer does not include
error correction.&P;  However, the land lines are much less prone to producing
errors than the radio channels.&M;

BURNING THE AIRWAVES&M;

Of all the products we tested, Telebit's CellBlazer moved data fastest over
the cellular link, averaging nearly 14-kilobit-per-second transfer rates with
compressable files in PC Labs' performance tests.&P;  Microcom's MNP 10 modems
weren't as fast but performed more reliably.&M;

These fast speeds are especially valuable when transmitting long text files
and graphics files that can easily measure half a megabyte or more.&P;  The
faster the transmission, the less air time used.&P;  The better the reliability,
the fewer retransmissions.&P;  Both save money.&P;  In the United States, monthly
access fees range from about $15 to $35, and that doesn't include the cost of
the calls.&P;  Calls are billed at about 20 to 60 cents per minute, in 60-second
or 30-second increments.&P;  The average total monthly bill is $84, but many
businesses tend to spend much more.&M;

Our tests leave little doubt that cellular telephone systems can be an
efficient transmission medium for portable data communications.&P;  But mere
efficiency isn't necessarily enough in a business tool.&P;  Many potential users
could find it frustrating to contend with interface devides, AC/DC power
inverters, cigarette lighter adapters, and thick, black cables cluttering
their vehicles.&P;  On top of all that, the external modems we evaluated are far
from our ideal of portability: 3-pound boxes the size of hardcover books turn
the "mobile office" into the "luggable office."&M;

Some mobile communications experts think the use of fax machines with
cellular phones will be more popular, at least in the short term, than with
laptops.&P;  Fax machines are easy to use, and business people feel more
comfortable sending a fax than learning a communications program to send
electronic mail.&M;

One development that will affect data transmission is the switch from analog
to digital cellular systems.&P;  Cellular was probably one of the last major
communications networks to begin its commercial life in the analog world.&O;
During the next several years, cellular operators will spend hundreds of
millions of dollars changing to digital.&P;  Because of this, cellular phones
will be offered with both analog and digital capabilities; consequently,
they're likely to be larger and more expensive.&M;

Unfortunately for proponents of data applications, the first generation of
digital networks will not include standards for transmitting data.&P;  Some
mobile communications observers say it's an indication of the cellular
industry's lack of interest in data or lack of foresight.&P;  Others say the
industry just didn't have sufficient time to develop both voice and data
standards, and left data for the second generation.&P;  No matter what the
reasons, the lack of standards is likely to hamper the development of digital
data products and increase their costs.&M;

Cellular data communications is in its infancy.&P;  Like any young industry, the
users, resellers, and vendors need to communicate and cooperate.&P;  With
industry growth comes improved products and service.&P;  For now, we recommend
you contact a reputable and experienced reseller.&P;  Insist on an on-site
demonstration under varying conditions to test for the greatest reliability.&M;

Even though our reviews focus on cellular modems, the modems are only a small
portion of the cellular data equation.&P;  We used products and services from
other companies that deserve recognition.&M;

Cellular One in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, provided us with its air time and
a Uniden tranportable phone.&P;  The company's staff was helpful and
professional.&P;  They quickly responded to our problem of not being able to use
the Telebit CellBlazer on Cellular One's system.&P;  The system's engineers
immediately contacted Telebit to work on a solution.&M;

Southwestern Bell in Dallas, Texas, also provided us with air time and expert
help.&P;  Southwestern Bell installs a large amount of data equipment in its
markets.&P;  Since Southwestern Bell has had experience with all of the products
we tested, it provided a great deal of insight into the dos and don'ts of
cellular data transmission.&O;

INTELLIGENCE TECHNOLOGY CORP. ITC 386 PEP The ITC 386 PEP from Intelligence
Technology Corp. is currently the only laptop on the market that comes with
an affordable internal cellular modem option.&P;  The $4,363 unit teams
respectable computing power and a sizable hard disk while producing cellular
communications in a relatively compact package.&M;

The 386 PEP uses ITC-RM (for Reliable Model) as its cellular error-correcting
protocol.&P;  ITC-RM is a modified MNP 5 protocol capable of adjusting to
smaller block sizes so that it can handle the many repeats required over
marginal communications circuits more efficiently.&P;  MNP 5 block sizes
typically vary from 64 to 256 bytes.&P;  When many errors occur, the
communications software adjusts the blocks to a smaller size, reducing
retransmission time.&P;  ITC-RM allows the block size to shrink down to 16
bytes, thereby keeping retries to a minimum.&M;

The 386 PEP modem can communicate with most other types of modems.&P;  Since it
works with MNP 5, V.22bis, Bell 212A, and Bell 103 standard modems at a
maximum rate of 2,400 bits per second, users can transfer data to other
services over normal phone lines.&M;

Computing power for the 386 PEP battery-operated portable comes from a 16-MHz
80386SX microprocessor.&P;  The ITC laptop includes a backlit VGA display and an
internal 40MB hard disk.&P;  (For more information on the computer, see "Power
Portables: The Next Wave," PC Magazine, October 16, 1990.)&M;

In our evalulation of this integrated laptop/cellular modem system, we found
the modem would not connect at 1,200 bps though it was rated for 2,400-bps
operation.&P;  ITC assures us that this temporary problem has been corrected in
production models.&P;  But because of the slow connected signaling speed, the
throughput rate for the 386 PEP devices were low--nearly 5 kilobits per
second less than that of the CellBlazer on the noncompressed file transfer.&O;
Logically, the numbers should be more in line with the throughput of the
Microcom modems at 2,400 bps.&M;

Unlike the other modems tested, ITC does not currently market a desktop or
host model; consequently, ITC-RM file transfers work only from one PEP laptop
to another.&M;

The 386 PEP combined with a Motorola phone and Cellular Connection make a
nice two-piece cellular data package.&P;  If size, convenience, and weight
influence your buying decision, ITC should be high on your list.&P;  However, a
host model is not yet available.&O;

MICROCOM INC. Microcom C96 and M96 Microcom makes many types of modems, but
markets two especially designed for cellular communication.&P;  Meant to
function as a team, the M96 ($999) gets its power from a cigarette lighter in
a vehicle, while the C96 ($899) attaches to the host computer for a land-line
connection.&P;  These two modems are an excellent solution if your primary
method of communication is cellular.&M;

Microcom developed and licenses the Microcom Network Protocol (MNP), the most
widely used error-correction and compression scheme for dial-up modems.&O;
Since Microcom was so successful with MNP 4 and MNP 5, it is now trying to
make the MNP 10 cellular error-free file-compression protocol the de factor
standard.&P;  Fact is, other cellular modem manufacturers want their protocols
to be the standard, too.&P;  This leaves users stranded on their own protocol
islands, able to communicate only with the same type of modem on the other
end.&P;  At least the M96 and C96 cellular modems incorporate previous levels of
MNP--specifically MNP 5--allowing data transmission, at less throughput, to
other modems.&M;

In appearance, both modems are identical.&P;  The 2- by 6.5- by 11-inch modems,
cased in black plastic, have front-panel controls and LEDs.&P;  Two buttons
activate answer or originate modes and switch between talk or data mode.&P;  An
array of seven LEDs displays the various states of the modem's activity and
the status of the connection.&P;  Neither modem includes an on/off powers
switch, despite references to one in the documentation.&P;  On the back, phone
and jack plugs are clearly labeled, along with an eight-position DIP switch,
reset button, and volume control.&M;

When communicating with each other, the M96 and C96 use MNP 7 data
compression with MNP 10 error correction.&P;  Even so, the Microcom modem
software built into the M96 and C96 operates as a superset of existing modem
standards.&P;  This allows one or the other to communicate with all MNP modems,
V.22bix, Bell 212A, and Bell 103, but the maximum rate for this duo is 2,400
bits per second.&P;  Microcom may have better served the demands of cellular
data transfer by adding 9,600-bps support to the host C96.&P;  This would allow
better throughput for faster land-line communications.&M;

The Microcom modems transferred our test data files reliably.&P;  Though not as
efficient as the Telebit CellBlazer, the M96 had throughput nearly equal to
that of the comparison modem set up for V.22bix, MNP 5 communications.&P;  The
M96's transfer of the uncompressed file, at 2.73 kilobits per second, was
more than twice as fast as that of the ITC internal modem.&M;

On the whole, the Microcom M96 and C96 cellular combination provides fast,
reliable data communications.&P;  The documentation needs work, and the M96
needs to lose some weight.&P;  And although the M96 is as large as the
CellBlazer, it was designed to operate on 12 volts in a vehicle, making it
easily transportable.&O;

TELEBIT CORP. Telebit has been making modems since 1984; over the years, it
has also manufactured modems for Ventel and Racal-Milgo.&P;  Telebit focuses
primarily on the highspeed market: Originally, its TrailBlazer pioneered fast
data communications with uncompressed throughput of 18,000 bits per second.&O;
Now Telebit is moving its speed demon to the cellular air waves.&P;  Its $1,245
CellBlazer offers fast throughput and reliable connections.&M;

Telebit wants Packetized Ensemble Protocol (PEP), its cellular
error-correcting protocol, to be the industry standard.&P;  PEP modulation uses
multicarrier technology to maximize the data-carrying capacity of the
cellular bandwidth.&P;  Over the cellular network, PEP dynamically adapts to the
portions of the channel spectrum with less noise.&P;  Multicarrier signal
averaging compensates for fading and impulse noise, eliminating the need for
forward error correction.&P;  Additionally, the CellBlazer reduces the
modulation rate in 100-bps increments, so in theory it can find the optimal
throughput rate.&M;

The CellBlazer requires more setup and configuration steps than most modems.&O;
Flexible communications software is required to set the various S registers
needed to properly configure the Telebit modem for your equipment.&P;  For
example, you have to set the S175 register on both the cellular and land-line
modems for the brand and model of your cellular phone.&M;

Unlike the Microcom C96, the CellBlazer supports land-line speeds up to 9,600
bps, allowing you to put it on all of your host lines.&P;  The CellBlazer
communicates with the installed base of low-speed land-line and cellular
modems at 300, 1,200, and 2,400 bps.&P;  It also ably communicates with other
high-speed Telebit and PEP-compatible modems.&P;  It also supports V.42 and MNP
4 error-correction along with Lempel-ZIV and MNP 5 data compression.&M;

Physically, the beige-colored plastic CellBlazer is large and strong.&P;  It
measures 2.5 by 8.5 by 13 inches and weighs 3 pounds on its own, growing to
nearly 8 pounds with power supply and third-party 12-volt converter.&P;  The
size and weight of the total traveling.&P;  CellBlazer package make it difficult
to class this device as even a transportable, but its fine performance makes
the extra weight tolerable.&M;

Because cellular communications is all about being mobile, the CellBlazer's
120-volt power supply requirement is strange.&P;  Given some of the convenient
features that Telebit has built into the CellBlazer, it's even stranger that
the company does not sell a device to convert 12 volts to 120 volts.&O;
Nevertheless, the CellBlazer's connections are well labeled and easy to
understand.&P;  The front panel includes eight LEDs displaying status
information, and two switches.&P;  One switch toggles the voice and data
connections for talking and file transfer without placing another call.&P;  The
other switch selects one of two stored default parameter profiles.&P;  These
user-defined profiles contain S parameter settings and AT commands, so you
can reconfigure your modem literally at the flip of a switch.&P;  On the back of
the modem, the phone and line jacks are clearly labeled.&M;

In our testing of the CellBlazer, we found it to live up to its name.&O;
Throughput on compressible random data, database, and graphics file transfers
was almost double that of the Microcom modem.&M;

However, in evaluating the Telebit CellBlazer we discovered that it did not
work over the Cellular One System carrier we used.&P;  Upon investigation we
found a suspect.&P;  The cell used for testing is known as a remote cell site.&O;
This means that our transmissions were sent by microwave to the main cell
site, then hit a land line to go to their destination.&P;  According to local
cellular operators, remote cell sites typically run a little "hotter" than
nonremote sites.&P;  Telebit and Cellular One are working to define the problem,
but the CellBlazer worked flawlessly after switching to a carrier with
nonremote cells.&M;

Cellular data communications is not easy, but then, land-line communication
is not simple, either.&P;  Using the CellBlazer requires some patience and
experience, but with a qualified reseller holding your hand, you should be up
and running quickly.&P;  If you have a lot of data to send and have good
cellular coverage, the CellBlazer works great.&M;

<SUMMARY>Programmers who work in MS-DOS should understand how input from
the keyboard is processed and interpreted by the operating system.&O;
The computer's BIOS keeps track of the state of each key on the
keyboard, and each time a key is pressed, one byte representing
the key's ASCII hexadecimal code and one byte that differentiates
keys with the same code are sent to the keyboard buffer.&P;  The
second byte, or scan code, can distinguish between function keys
and arrow keys, which do not have ASCII codes.&P;  Hardware scan
codes, which indicate the particular key being depressed or
released, are read from the keyboard port.&P;  Two pointers indicate
the starting address and ending address of the keyboard buffer's
queue.&P;  Interrupt 9, which puts keystrokes in the buffer, is
called whenever a key is pressed.&P;  Interrupt 16 is called to
extract a keystroke from the buffer by a program that expects
input from the keyboard.&P;  Other DOS functions are discussed.&M;

Learning Your Way Around the Keyboard Under FOS, Part 1 Even if you keep a
mouse within reach, the keyboard is still your primary interface with the PC.&O;
But just how it tells programs what you want to do remains a mystery to most
users, so in this Lab Notes I'll present an overview of how the keyboard
works at the system level.&P;  Programmers will gain an understanding of what's
going on under their high-level languages, and users will learn how to better
manager their TSRs.&M;

In this Lab Notes we'll be working entirely within the DOS world; both
Microsoft Windows and OS/2 completely replace the default keyboard driver and
so require a different treatment.&P;  In the DOS world, the briefest overview of
keyboard operation can be given by saying that interrupt 9 processes
keystrokes and places them in the keyboard buffer, while interrupt 16h is
used by applications to obtain keystrokes from the keyboard buffer.&P;  As that
terse summary suggests, however, to understand what the keyboard does will
require some familiarity with hex numbering, 83x86 memory addressing, and
interrupts, so it's a good idea to begin the discussion with these things.&M;

WORKING IN HEX&M;

Throughout this discussion we'll be using hexadecimal (base 16) numbers,
known simply as hex.&P;  Where there's any chance of confusion, we place a
lowercase h after such numbers as a reminder.&P;  Hex numbers need 16 symbols to
represent them--six beyond the ten required for decimal notation--so
following 0 through 9 come A, B, C, D, E, F.&P;  The number Eh is equal to 14 in
decimal terms.&M;

Just as the decimal number 123 means 1 times 100 (or [10.sup.2]) plus 2 times
10 (or [10.sup.1]) plus 3 times 1 (or [10.sup.0]), so the hex number 123h
means 1 times 256 ([16.sup.2]) plus 2 times 16([16.sup.1]) plus 3 times 1
([16.sup.0]).&P;  Thus, 123h is 291 decimal, and, for a more complicated example
at random, 13DEh becomes (1*4096 + 3*256 + 13*16 +14), or 5,086 in decimal.&M;

If you're unfamiliar with working in hexadecimal notation, it may be tempting
to try to keep translating hex to and from decimal.&P;  In the situations in
which hex numbers are used, however, you won't really gain anything by such
translations.&P;  It doesn't matter that interrupt 16h is 22 decimal or that the
start of the keyboard buffer (41Eh) is 1,054 in decimal.&P;  Hence, I recommend
you regard hex numbers simply as themselves--numbers in base 16.&M;

Even when you do have to do arithmetic, you'll eventually find it much easier
to do it in hex, rather than by translating to decimal and back.&P;  Consider
the following example:&M;

14FD h 8FA4 h [[[[[[ A4A1 h&M;

You once had to learn that 13 + 4 was 17 by counting 14, 15, 16, 17.&O;
Likewise, at first you may have to learn that D + 4 = 11h by counting E, F,
10, 11.&P;  With practice, however, this process becomes second nature.&P;  And if
it doesn't, most PC calculators have a hex mode, for the rare occasions that
require hexadecimal arithmetic.&P;  Even DEBUG will give you the sum and
difference, respectively, of two hex numbers if you enter&M;

H nnnn mmmm&M;

at the - prompt (where nnnn and mmmm are the hex numbers).&M;

80x86 ADDRESSING SCHME&M;

A byte has 8 bits and so describes 2 to the power of 8, or 256 possibilities.&O;
Since one hex digit corresponds to 4 bits, it requires two hex digits to
describe 1 byte.&P;  Bytes are thus written in the form xx, with each x
representing a hex digit.&P;  Addresses are written in the form xxxx:xxxx, where
the hex number before the colon is called the segment and the number after
the colon is the offset.&P;  This curious way of writing addresses requires 4
bytes--2 for the segment and 2 for the offset--and is a consequence of the
original design of the PC.&M;

With 2 bytes--16 bits, or 4 hex digits--you could addresse [2.sup.16], or
65,536 locations.&P;  The 8088/8086 CPUs used by the original PC were designed
to access 1MB (that's 1,048,576 RAM locations)--a sizeable amount of memory
at that time.&M;

In absolute, or linear, address terms, this requires 20 bits (5 hex digits).&O;
Because the CPUs were internally designed to work with groups of 16 bits,
however, the rather cumbersome segment:offset scheme--which uses 32 bits to
represent an address that could have been expressed with 20 bits--was
adopted.&M;

Since there are 12 extra bits and [2.sup.12] is 4,096, each segment:offset
address has 4,096 possible representations.&P;  This isn't strictly true (there
are fewer possible representations for addresses below 1,000h), but the
principle is clear that the same absolute address in memory can be designated
by many different segment:offset combinations.&P;  If you start with what is
called a normalized address--one in which the segment is as large as possible
and the offset as small as possible--you can derive the other 4,095
equivalent representations by repeatedly subtracting 1 from the segment and
adding 16 (10h) to the offset.&P;  (If the segment is less than 4,096 (1000h),
you can't actually do this 4,096 times, because you'll hit zero before you
reach that number of iterations.)&M;

To compute the corresponding absolute (linear) address from any of its
segment: offset representations, you multiply the number to the left of the
colon by 10h (that is to say, you shift it left by one digit) and then add
the offset.&P;  Thus, the absolute address that corresponds to 1234:ABCD is&M;

12340 ABCD [[[[[[ 1CF0D&M;

Again, as with the hex/decimal conversion, it is usually not useful to
translate from the 32-bit representation into absolute addresses except to
determine whether two segment:offset addresses are actually names for the
same location.&M;

For example, address 0040:0010 is the same as 0000:0410.&P;  To determine this,
you shift 0040 left one place (yielding 00400), and the 0010, and you get
00410, the same linear address.&P;  In general, you won't often need to create
equivalent addresses.&P;  Rather, given two addresses, you'll want to know if
they are equivalent.&P;  To do that, you just convert them both to linear and
see if they're the same.&M;

Given a normalized address, however, suppose you do want to find an
equivalent address with a different segment.&P;  Let's assume the new segment is
less than the starting segment by an amount that doesn't exceed 0FFFh.&P;  Take
the difference between the two segment numbers, multiply it by 16 (10h), and
add the result to the offset.&P;  That's the offset that goes with the new
segment.&P;  So, for example, given 0040:0010, suppose you want the offset for
segment 0010.&P;  The difference is 30h.&P;  Multiply by 10h (very easy, just shift
it left one place) to get 300h.&P;  Hence 0010:0310 is an equivalent address.&M;

WHERE YOUR KEYSTROKES GO&M;

As I mentioned at the outset, processes connected with interrupt 9 put
keystrokes into a memory buffer, and processes connected with interrupt 16
get them out.&P;  Now that we know where to find it, it's time to look at what
goes on in the buffer, which, although the middle one, is the simplest
element in the chain.&M;

As shown in Figure 1, the first 400h (1,024 decimal) bytes in memory, from
address 0000:0000 to 0000:03FF, are used by the CPU to store an interrupt
vector table, which we'll discuss later on.&P;  Immediately above this (using
equivalent addressing), the area from 0040:0000 to 0040:00ff is used by the
BIOS--the low-level Basic Input/Output System--to store data, including input
from the keyboard.&P;  These 256 (decimal) memory bytes are known as the BIOS
data area or the BIOS communication area.&P;  The last 16 bytes of the BIOS data
area, called the Interprocess Communication Area, are intended to be used by
programs to exchange data.&P;  In fact, this area is used only rarely, in part
because there's no way to ensure that a third program won't overwrite what a
first program places there for a second program.&M;

To demonstrate just how keyboard information is stored in the BIOS data area,
I've written a simple Turbo Pascal program, BIOSDATA.EXE, which you can
download from PC MagNet.&P;  (Note: Instructions for downloading programs from
PC MagNet, including those referenced in this Lab Notes, are printed in the
article on this issue's free utility, WINWHERE.EXE.&P;  Commented source code is
provided with the download.)&P;  BIOSDATA loads and continually rereads and
displays the memory region from 0040:0000 to 0040:00FF, which gives you a
real-time view of what is happening there.&P;  It also periodically reads the
keyboard and exists when you hit Esc.&P;  The 256 bytes are displayed with the
address at the extreme left, a hex display in the middle, and an ASCII
display on the right, as seen in Figure 2.&P;  While it will be helpful to have
the program actually on the screen as you read what follows, the discussion
should be understandable without it.&M;

Make sure CapsLock, NumLock, and ScrollLock are off and then load BIOSDATA.&O;
The first thing you'll notice is that two areas are obviously counting--the
bytes at 0040:0040 and 0040:006C are changing rapidly with carryover to the
neighboring bytes.&M;

These have nothing to do with the keyboard, but, as you might guess, they are
keeping time.&P;  Approximately 18.2 times a second, the computer's internal
clock ticks, and special routines that change those bytes are run.&P;  The byte
at address 0040:006C is counting the ticks since midnight; the other (at
address 0040:0040) simply performs a countdown again and again, and is used
with the mechanism that shuts off the disk drive motor.&M;

Press and release the Right Shift key several times.&P;  You'll notice that the
byte at address 0040:0017h changes back and forth from 0 to 1.&P;  Now try the
same thing with Left Shift, then with the Ctrl key, and then with the Alt Key
(use the left Ctrl and Alt if your machine has two of them).&P;  If you don't
have BIOSDATA, what you would have seen is that they behaved just like Right
Shift except that Left Shift showed a 2, Ctrl a 4, and Alt an 8.&P;  Now press
Alt and Left Shift at the same time.&P;  You get 0A, which is decimal 10.&O;
That's exactly the sum of the Alt and Left Shift keys, that is, 8 + 2!&P;  The
system stores the state of each shifting key independently in 4 of the bits
of the byte at address 0040:0017.&M;

If you now try turning CapsLock on and off, you'll notice two things.&P;  First,
one of the bits in byte 0040:0018 tracks whether the CapsLock key is
physically pressed down or not.&P;  Since this is a toggle rather than a
shifting key, however, what's important is the CapsLock state.&P;  And whether
CapsLock is on or off is kept in 0400:0017, the same byte that keeps track of
the shifts.&P;  Thus all of the 8 bits in byte 0400:0017 are used: 4 for the
four shifting keys and 4 for the CapsLock, NumLock, ScrollLock, and Insert
toggles.&M;

Four bits in the byte at 0040:0018 keep track of whether the toggle keys are
depressed.&P;  For example, XyWrite can treat CapsLock as an extra shift by
using this byte.&P;  The lower 4 bits on that byte go unused in the original
PCs, XTs and early ATs.&P;  When the enhanced keyboard was introduced, however,
these bits were put to use keeping track of the difference between the Left
and Right Ctrl and Alt keys.&P;  If you have an enhanced keyboard and BIOSDATA,
try experimenting with the left and right Alt keys while watching bytes
0040:0017 and 0040:0018.&M;

Now, while watching the ASCII character display on the right of the screen,
hit the 1 key on the top row repeatedly (or hold it down).&P;  You should see
that the bytes in the addresses from 41Eh to 43Dh fill with alternating 1's
and happy faces.&P;  This memory area is known as the keyboard buffer.&P;  If you
look at BIOSDATA's hex dsplay for this area, you'll see that 31h alternates
with 02h.&P;  31h is the ASCII code for the character 1; we'll see about the
02h's--the happy faces--shortly.&P;  Try hitting some other number or letter
keys while watching what happens in the ASCII representation of the keyboard
buffer.&P;  You'll find that each keystroke sends a pair of bytes to that area,
and that the one at the even address is shown on the ASCII display as the
character you hit.&P;  I'll explain what happens to the odd bytes in a moment.&M;

Next, try alternately hitting the top row Plus key and the gray Plus key.&O;
The ASCII part is, not surprisingly, a plus, mirrored by 2Bh's (the ASCII
value of the plus sign) in the even addresses in the hex part of the display.&O;
But notice that the other half of what is placed in this area is different
for the two keys.&P;  In the odd addresses, you'll see 0Dh's for the top row
Plus key and 4Eh's for the gray Plus key.&P;  If you've ever wondered how
programs can distinguish between the two plus keys, now you know.&M;

We've determined so far that for each keystroke, 2 bytes are placed in the
keyboard buffer, the 32-byte memory area from 0040:001E to 0040:003D.&P;  The
even address byte gets an ASCII code.&P;  The odd address byte gets a code that
can distinguish between similar keys.&P;  To confirm this, watch what happens
when you push Ctrl-A, lowercase a, uppercase A, and Alt-A.&P;  The results are
shown below:&M;

The 1Eh that goes into each of the odd address bytes is obviously connected
with the A key on the keyboard.&P;  As indicated in the inset above, this is
called the scan code.&P;  It is also sometimes called the software scan code in
order to distinguish it from the hardware scan code which, as we'll see, is
often, but not always, the same.&M;

Looking at the middle column above, note that since Ctrl-A is an ASCII
character (like the uppercase and lowercase letters themselves), it returns a
genuine ASCII code.&P;  Alt-A doesn't have an ASCII analog, however, so it
returns 00h--the NUL code.&P;  For keystrokes that produce a 00h for the ASCII
code, the software scan code is sometimes called the extended ASCII code.&M;

From this example, you might provisionally conclude that the scan code byte
depends only on the key hit and that the ASCII code byte is used to
distinguish among the shift states of that key.&P;  But if you now successively
hit F1, Shift-F1, Ctrl-F1, and Alt-F1, you'll get the following results:&M;

Since function keys do not have ASCII equivalents, their ASCII code should
always be 00h, as it is.&P;  But, in order to distinguish between the shift
states of the function keys, we must violate our new provisional rule that
the code in the second half of the 2-byte combination depends only on the key
hit, not on its shift state.&M;

For the original PC keyboard the complete rule is this: In situations where
the ASCII code distinguishes shift states (that is, where the ASCII codes are
nonzero), the software scan code is the same as the hardware scan code (which
we'll investigate shortly).&P;  For keys whose ASCII codes are all 0--which
means the function keys and arrows--the scan code is the hardware scan code
for the unshifted keys, a fixed but arbitrary convention for the shifted
states.&M;

The enhanced keyboard adds a few extra complications.&P;  If you have one, try
the two different Left Arrows; you'll find the following correspondence:&M;

Note that for the extra keys that were introduced with the enhanced keyboard,
interrupt 9 places E0h in the ASCII part of the 2-byte sequence (since there
is no key for which E0h is a valid ASCII value).&P;  While not many bother to do
so, programs can thus distinguish the two Arrow keys on the enhanced
keyboard.&M;

GOING AROUND IN CIRCLES&M;

While we've been watching the changes that take place in the keyboard buffer
(the memory area from 0040:001E to 0040:003D), you may have noticed that as
you hit various keys, the bytes at addresses 0040:001A and 0040:001C were
also changing.&P;  One of these locations contain the address at which the next
keystroke will be added (the tail).&P;  The other contains the address from
which keystrokes will be removed (the head).&P;  BIOSDATA reads the keys as fast
as they're entered, so the head keeps up with the tail.&M;

The keyboard buffer is a queue, which is to say, keystrokes are added to the
queue at the tail and removed at the head.&P;  The tail pointer is at 0040:001C,
and 0040:001A is the head pointer.&P;  When these two pointers are equal, there
are no keystrokes waiting in the buffer.&P;  If you've been typing various
keystrokes into the buffer, why then does BIOSDATA always show the same
values for 0040:001C and 0040:001A?&M;

The reason is that the program is constantly on the lookout for an Esc, which
means that you want to exit.&P;  It does this by checking for a keystroke before
it updates the display.&P;  If there is a keystroke, it reads it from the
keyboard buffer using INT 16h and exits if it is an Esc.&P;  As a result, it is
taking keystrokes out of the buffer as fast as you can type them in.&P;  For
this reason the head and tail of the buffer seem to be updated at the same
time.&P;  Actually, on a slow machine (especially one with CGA where Turbo
Pascal uses snow checking to slow the display), you will notice that
0040:001C gets ahead of 0040:001A, which then catches up when you take your
hand from the keyboard.&M;

The buffer is circular, so it loops around when the pointer reaches
0040:003D.&P;  If the last keystroke went into 0040:003C/0040:003D, the last
byte in the buffer region, the next will go into 0040:001E/0040:001F, the
first byte in the buffer.&M;

Since it contains 32 bytes, you might think it would accommodate 16
keystrokes; for if the address of the head was fixed, there could be 16
possible places that the tail address can be.&P;  But since 0 strokes has to be
a possibility, the 16 possibilities must be 0 ...&P;  15.&P;  Put differently, if
one allowed 16 keystrokes, the tail would wrap around and catch up with the
head, and there would be no way to distinguish an empty buffer and a full
one!&M;

This completes most of what I have to say about the BIOS data area.&P;  At this
point, we haven't explained exactly how keystrokes get there, how programs
get them out from there, and what programs like TSRs can do to modify the
usual keyboard operations.&P;  We'll leave most of this for Part 2, but at this
point we should take up the questions of what interrupts are in general and
how they are generated by the keyboard hardware in particular.&P;  This will
take us back to the lowest part of memory shown in Figure 1, the area from
0000:0000 to 0040:0000, and will also afford us a chance to explain the
hardware scan codes that often end up in the odd-address bytes in the
keyboard buffer.&M;

INTERRUPTS AND SCAN CODES&M;

The Intel 80X86 family is designed to use interrupts as the primary means by
which both hardware and software communicate their needs to the
microprocessor.&P;  Hardware interrupts ("true" interrupts by some programmers'
reckoning) are prioritized by an interrupt controller chip on the motherboard
before being passed on for CPU action.&P;  Thus, roughly 18.2 times a second, a
clock chip stimulates the interrupt controller to cause the CPU to call
interrpt 8 to update the time.&P;  And when you depress or release a key on the
keyboard, and interrupt controller gets a signal and taps the CPU on the
shoulder and tells it to call interrupt 9.&M;

The alternative to an interrupt-driven system is to make the CPU continually
run around to its various ports, polling each to see if one of them needs its
attention.&P;  That's the only other way the CPU could learn that you've pressed
a key.&P;  But periodically polling the keyboard port wastes a lot of CPU
time--even when you're actively typing rather than looking at the screen.&P;  An
interrupt system is like having students raise a hand if they have a
question, as opposed to having the teacher call the class roll and ask each
student if the point is clear.&M;

When a program wants to read a keystroke from the buffer, it issues a
software interrupt--specifically, interrupt 16.&P;  Applications also issue
interrupts to call upon DOS services, such as reading from and writing to
disk.&M;

When an interrupt is called, either by hardware or software, a sequence of
predetermined steps is executed.&P;  The routine that constitutes this sequence
is called the interrupt handler.&P;  Whether this routine is actually located in
the BIOS or elsewhere, a program must be able to access it by calling its
interrupt number.&M;

That's where the first 400h (1,024 decimal) bytes of the PC's RAM memory come
in.&P;  This area of memory is called the interrupt vector table, and it can
hold 100h or 256 addresses in segment:offset form.&P;  (You'll recall that
memory addresses in the DOS world consist of a 2-byte segment and a 2-byte
offset, thus requiring 4 bytes per address.)&P;  As part of the bootup process,
the built-in ROM BIOS and the hidden system files place the addresses of
known interrup handlers--including the default routines for keyboard
interrupts 9 and 16--in this table.&P;  Thus, for example, if interrupt 16h is
called, execution immediately jumps to the 4-byte address starting at
0000:0058.&P;  If a program wants to enhance the services provided by the
default routines, there's a way (that we'll describe in Part 2) for it to do
this.&M;

In addition to stimulating the interrupt controller to issue an interrupt 9
request, each press or release of one of the keys on the keyboard creates a
unique hardware scan code.&P;  That code appears at the keyboard port (60h),
where it is read by the interrupt 9 BIOS code and translated into the 2-byte
sequence that goes into the keyboard buffer.&M;

On the original PC, the hardware scan code for a key release was exactly 80h
higher than for the code for the press of that same key.&P;  For example, the
scan code for the a key is 1Eh on depress and 9Eh on release.&P;  Until it
resets the keyboard, whenever the CPU looks at port 60h, this hardware scan
code will be returned to it.&P;  On the enhanced keyboard, there is a difference
for the new keys that issue multiple scan codes; for example, Up Arrow on the
cursor pad is E0 + 4B on depress and E0 + CB on release--there is nothing
added to the E0.&M;

The hardware scan codes are just a sequential numbering of the keys as they
were physically laid out on the original PC keyboard, starting with Esc at
01h, the 1 key at 02h, and so on.&P;  From the original keyboard's point of
view, the Shift keys were no different from the other keys.&P;  Since the left
Shift key was adjacent to the \ key, their scan codes became 2Ah and 2Bh,
respectively.&P;  As the keyboard changed, the keys migrated but kept their scan
codes, with the extra keys getting new codes.&M;

So that you can see for yourself what the hardware scan codes are for each of
the keys on your machine, I've written a program, INT9.EXE.&P;  The program
returns the set of hardware scan codes called by the interrupt 9 routines.&O;
INT9.EXE required some inline code in order to put its own handler inside the
normal interrupt 9 loop.&P;  This inline code was taken from Turbo Power
Software's Turbo Professional and is used here with permission.&P;  Because of
the number of scan codes that some of the enhanced combinations produce, the
display can be somewhat confusing, so I have placed a blank line after every
keyboard-release scan code that occurs with no other strokes stacked.&O;
Depending on exactly when the interrupt 9s are processed, however, this will
sometimes cause some extra blank lines in the sequence of eight codes that
are produced when you depress and then release a cursor key with NumLock on.&M;

How you get from the scan codes at port 60h to the 2-byte sequences held in
the keyboard buffer will be our starting point in Part 2.&M;

<SUMMARY>The WINWHERE utility allows Microsoft Windows 3.0 users to find
files regardless of the number of directories and logical drives
available.&P;  The File Manager portion of Windows 3.0 requires users
to search each drive and directory separately, but users on
networks often have access to many drives holding many
directories.&P;  WINWHERE uses a single dialog box interface that
enables users to search for files using standard wildcard
characters.&P;  WINWHERE creates a modal dialog box using information
from Windows 3.0 applications.&P;  Modal dialog boxes must be
dismissed by the user before other windows can be accessed.&M;

Finding Your Files in Windows 3.0 with WINWHERE Most likely you've already
been delighted by the improvements Microsoft achieved by separating the
Program Manager from the File Manager in Windows 3.0.&P;  You can now start a
Program Manager application simply by double-clicking on its icon, and you
can add, delete, or change the icons with ease.&P;  You can now organize the
programs you frequently use into convenient groups, rather than having to
wave your way through the disk directory structure to find them.&P;  You can
even jump-start a data file whose extension is associated with a particular
application in the [Extensions] section of WIN.INI.&M;

But while the Program Manager now has a more object-oriented feel, the new
File Manager--though an advance on the file management portion of the MS-DOS
Executive--still looks like a Windowsized version of a traditional DOS shell
utility.&P;  One of its glaring deficiencies is that it lacks a file finder, the
need for which became obvious during a recent visit to PC Magazine.&M;

A large organization that uses Windows 3.0 may have many different servers on
the network.&P;  Thus, in addition to his own physical and RAM drives, a typical
user may have many different remote directories mapped into logical drives on
his system.&P;  A PC Magazine staffer, for example, might have 20 different
logical drives.&P;  How is he to find a particular file from within a Windows
3.0 session?&P;  There's no other way than to hand-navigate into each
subdirectory of every logical drive on the system and perform a visual search
for the desired file!&P;  WINWHERE, a file-finding utility written specifically
for Windows 3.0, will eliminate this productivity roadblock.&M;

WINWHERE lets you choose a file specification and select one or more drives
to search.&P;  Your file specification can be either a complete filename or one
containing the standard ? and * wildcards.&P;  You can limit the search by file
date and size.&P;  All of the filenams that match your search criteria are
displayed in a scrollable list box.&P;  As a bonus, WINWHERE gives you the
option of automatically generating a batch file that contains a command for
each file you select form the list box.&M;

You can download a ready-to-run copy of WINWHERE.EXE from PC MagNet.&P;  Simply
follow the instructions given in the sidebar "WINWHERE by Modem."&M;

If you wish to make modifications of your own to the program, you will also
want to download the C source code and its associated files.&P;  In order to
recompile the program, you will require the Windows, Version 3.0 Software
Development Kit (SDK) and a C compiler capble of generating Windows code
(Microsoft C 5.1 and later).&P;  You must make certain that the Windows INCLUDE
files are stored in a directory specified by the INCLUDE environment
variable.&P;  Also make sure that the Windows libraries are in a directory
specified by the LIB environment variable.&P;  Then, using the MAKE.EXE utility
that comes with Microsoft C 5.1, you are able to recompile simply by issuing
the command&M;

MAKE WINWHERE&M;

USING WINWHERE&M;

Once WINWHERE is on your disk, you'll want to add it to a Program Manager
group.&P;  So start Windows and click the mouse on the program group into which
you would like to put WINWHERE.&P;  (I chose the Windows Applications group on
my system.)&P;  Select the File/New menu item from the main menu bar, enter the
absolute pathname of WINWHERE, and press the OK button.&P;  The WINWHERE icon
will be added to the program group, so you can run it simply by
double-clicking the mouse on its icon.&M;

WINWHERE has a leaner look than most Windows applications.&P;  In place of the
usual main overlapped window and menu bar, WINWHERE brings up only a single
main dialog box, shown in Figure 1.&P;  A program like WINWHERE doesn't need a
lot of different commands, so there's no need for a menu bar.&P;  Since all user
interaction is through the dialog box and nothing needs to be displayed on an
encompassing frame window, there's no need for a man window either.&P;  You
simply fill out the appropriate fields in the dialog box and click on the OK
button.&M;

Many users have a number of common file specifications they use repeatedly.&O;
For example, you might often wish to search simply for PageMaker or XyWrite
files.&P;  To eliminate the need to re-enter such frequently used filespecs,
WINWHERE provides a combination box that lets you list your file types and
put their associated file specifications into the File Name field directly.&O;
The *.* file specification is associated with the default Anything file type,
and you would want, for example, to associate the *.PM3 specification with
your PageMaker files.&M;

You can add identifying file types and their specifications to the
combination box by cliking on the Add File push button.&P;  This brings up the
dialog box shown in Figure 2.&P;  After entering the necessary information in
the two edit fields, click the OK button and the file type will automatically
be added to the combination box.&P;  The entire list of file type/specification
pairs will be saved in the WIN.INI file when you exit, so WINWHERE will
always come up with your custom set of file types.&M;

Having entered or selected the desired file specification, you can then
select one or more of the drives to be searched.&P;  All of the drives in your
system, including logical network drives and RAM drives, are listed in a
multiple-selection list box, so you simply click on the appropriate
letter(s).&P;  The default, if you make no selection, is the current drive and
directory with its subdirectories if there are any.&M;

WINWHERE also lets you search for a file whose size is greater than, less
than or equal to a specified number.&P;  Just click on the By Size check box,
enter a size in the adjoining edit field (no commas or abbreviations are
allowed), and click on one of the three radio buttons that designate the
desired comparison.&P;  Note: The edit field and the radio buttons are disabled
until the By Size check box is toggled On.&P;  A similar procedure lets you
match files that were created (or last modified) later than, earlier than, or
on the date you specify.&M;

Once you have chosen the file specification, the disk drives to search
through, and the other search criteria, all you need to do is push the OK
button to commence the search operation.&P;  The complete pathnames of all the
files that satisfy the criteria will appear in the Found Files list box.&O;
When the search operation has completed, you can then use the cursor keys or
the mouse to read through the list of files.&M;

As a final option, WINWHERE provides a way for you to generate a batch file
that contains a single command for every file selected from those presented
in the Found Files list box.&P;  You might, for example, want to copy some or
all of the found files to a diskette.&P;  To do this, press the Find Options
push button.&P;  A dialog box containing two edit fields and a multiple
selection listbox will pop up.&P;  The edit fields prompt you for the filename
you want to use for the batch file (remember to include the .BAT extension),
and for the command to be given to each selected file.&P;  The multiple
selection list box contains a copy of the entire list of found files.&P;  by
default, all of the files in the list box are automatically selected.&P;  To
deselect a file, simply click the mouse on the name of the file.&M;

In entering the command string(s) that will constitute the batch file, you
must use an exclamation point where the filename should be substituted.&P;  For
example, to enter the command to copy a file to the A: drive, you would enter
the string.&M;

copy ! a:&M;

If you had selected the files LETTER.PM3, RECIPE.PM3, and FOOBAZ.DOC, the
batch file generated by WINWHERE would then consist of the following lines:&M;

copy LETTER.PM3 a: copy RECIPE.PM3 a: copy FOOBAZ.DOC a:&M;

You can also navigate WINWHERE using the keyboard.&P;  Pressing Tab will move
you clockwise from field to field, and Shft-Tab moves you counter-clockwise.&O;
To make a selection in a list box (for example, the drive list box), simply
hit the Spacebar.&P;  Once you enter information in a field or make a selection,
press Tab to move to the next field; pressing Enter will execute the search.&O;
Once you've specified your search criteria, Tab to the OK button and press
Enter.&M;

That's all there is to using WINWHERE?&P;  Now let's examine some inner workings
of the program and see how to code this for a Windows environment.&M;

UNDERSTANDING WINWHERE&M;

When writing Windows programs in C, the entry point is a user-written
function called WinMain().&P;  Most Windows programs begin execution by
registering the various window classes for all of the windows the application
uses, including the class for the main window.&P;  The application then normally
creates and displays the main window, after which it goes into the standard
Windows message-processing loop.&M;

WINWHERE does none of this.&P;  Instead, it directly loads the main dialog box
from the binary resource information tacked onto the end of every Windows
application's .EXE file.&P;  It does this by calling the DialogBox() function.&O;
DialogBox() will load and display the dialog box and will then go into an
internal message-processing loop that monitors all messages sent to the
dialog box.&M;

The DialogBox() function creates a modal dialog box.&P;  With a modal dialog
box, the user must explicitly dismiss the dialog box before interacting with
any other window in the application.&P;  The user can dismiss a modal dialog box
by clicking the mouse on the OK or CANCEL push button.&P;  A less frequently
encountered type of dialog box is the modeless dialog box.&P;  With a modeless
dialog box, the user can switch the input focus between the dialog box and
another window in the application at any time.&P;  The PIF editor window in
Windows is a modeless dialog box.&M;

Every dialog box must call a function that handles the message flow from
Windows to the dialog box.&P;  This function allows the Windows application to
process these messages before the dialog box manager does.&P;  Figure 3 shows a
diagram of the processing that surrounds a modal dialog box.&P;  The dialog box
function for WINWHERE's main dialog box is called WhereDlgProc(), and it
looks almost like a normal window procedure.&P;  Notice, however, that a dialog
box function must return a 1-byte BOOL value rather than the 4-byte LONG
value returned by a window procedure.&P;  The dialog box function returns TRUE
if it processes the message itself; it returns FALSE if the dialog box
manager should process the message instead.&M;

The first message always sent by Windows to a dialog box is the
WN_INIT-DIALOG message.&P;  It gives the programmer the chance to initialize the
various controls in the dialog box before the dialog box is actually
displayed.&P;  Since you can minimize WINWHERE's main dialog box, we first want
to associate an icon with it.&M;

When a window is minimized, Windows hides the window itself and displays an
icon in its place.&P;  The icon to be displayed is usually associated with a
window class when the programmer registers the class.&P;  (The programmer loads
the icon into the program and obtains a handle to the icon.&P;  The handle is
then placed into the WNDCLASS structure that is used when registering a
window class.)&P;  But since there is no class registration code in WINWHERE,
how do we associate an icon with the dialog box?&P;  How does the WINWHERE
dialog box come to belong to a window class?&M;

Windows predefines a window class to which most dialog boxes belong.&P;  You can
verify this by using the SPY program that comes with the Windows SDK to
examine the structure of a typical dialog box.&P;  The single line of code that
associates an icon with the dialog box is&M;

SetClassWord(hDlg, GCW_HICON, LoadIcon(hInst, "WinWhere"));&M;

We use LoadIcon() to load the specified icon from the .EXE file.&P;  This
function returns the handle of the loaded icon.&P;  To place the handle of the
icon into the window class data structure, we then call SetClassWord() with
GCW_HICON as the second argument and the handle of the loaded icon as the
third argument.&P;  The line of code above will associate the loaded icon with
every dialog box WINWHERE creates.&P;  This may not be the ideal procedure, but
since WINWHERE uses only one minimizable dialog box, we can get away with it.&M;

A second task to be performed during the dialog box initialization process is
loading the string containing your customized list of
file-type/file-specification pairings.&P;  These are stored as one long string
in the WIN.INI file, as typified by the four pairings in the line that
follows:&M;

[WinWhere] FileTypes = Anything *.* Document *.doc Pagemaker *.pm3 XYWrite
*.xyw&M;

We can load this string from the WIN.INI file by using the Windows function
GetProfileString().&P;  When you start WINWHERE for the very first time, only
the Anything *.* pairing is placed into the combination box.&P;  It's up to you
to add more entries of your own.&M;

The current implementation of WINWHERE cannot delete or edit a
file-type/file-specification pairing once stored.&P;  You can do this yourself,
however, by using an ordinary ASCII text editor to edit the WIN.INI file.&O;
Simply search for the [WinWhere] section and edit the specification string
yourself.&P;  Remember to leave a blank between a file type and the
corresponding specification.&P;  Indeed, you could edit the WIN.INI file from
within Windows by using the SYSEDIT program that comes with Windows.&P;  (Note
that Windows does not preinstall the SYSEDIT program in the Program Manager
when you first install Windows.&P;  You can, however, use the File/New menu
choice to install it yourself into one of the program groups.)&M;

The final thing we must do in the initialization code is to get the names of
all of the disk drives in the system and insert them in the Drive list box.&O;
This is done by sending the LB_DIR message to the Drive list box, using a
suitable value for the wParam parameter:&M;

SendDlgItemMessage(hDlg, ID_DRIVELIST, LB_DIR, 0xC000, (LONG) (LPSTR)&M;
"~~~.~~~");

The 0xC000 is the value of wParam, and informs Windows that we want an
exclusive search for all drives.&P;  Unfortunately, left to its own devices,
Windows will automatically search for all normal files as well as the drives
and will thus put the name of each file found in the list box.&P;  Since we
obviously don't want filenames in the Drive list box, we deceive Windows by
setting the lParam value to the search specification of ~~~.~~~.&P;  Since the
odds are that your system does not have a file called ~~~.~~~, Windows wonht
find any files with that name, and the only thing it will put into the Drive
list box will be the drive names themselves.&M;

After WhereDlgProc() processes the WM_INITDIALOG message, control is returned
to Windows' internal dialog box manager, which then displays the dialog box.&O;
The only other message to which we must react is the WM_COMMAND message.&O;
This message is sent to WhereDlgProc() whenever an event of interest happens
to one of the dialog box controls.&P;  When a WM_COMMAND message is sent, the
wParam value contains the identifier of the control in which the event
occurred, and the HIWORD of lParam contains a certain notification code.&P;  In
WINWHERE's case, we must take some kind of action when any one of the five
push buttons is clicked, when the By Size and the By Date check boxes are
clicked, and when you select an entry from the File Type combination box.&M;

When the By Size or By Date check box is not checked, we should disable the
edit control and the three radio buttons of that control group.&P;  This
prevents you from entering data in the edit field and from using the mouse or
keyboard to select a radio button.&P;  Moreover, the input focus cannot be set
to a disabled control.&P;  However, when you check one of these check boxes, the
controls in that control group should all be enables so that he can enter
data in the edit field and select one of the radio buttons.&M;

To enable and disable a window, we use the EnableWindow() function.&P;  The
second argument to this function is a Boolean value that is nonzero if the
window is to be enabled and zero if the window is to be disabled.&P;  The code
to accomplish this is shown in section [A] of Figure 4.&M;

When an item is selected from a combination box, the WM_COMMAND message is
sent to WhereDlgProc() with the HIWORD of the 1Param value set to the
CBN_SELCHANGE notification code.&P;  This message is useful to process if
another control tracks the current selection in a list box or in a
combination box.&P;  In this application, when the currently selected file type
in the combination box changes, we must change the contents of the File Name
edit control to reflect the corresponding file specification.&P;  The relevant
code is shown in section [B] of Figure 4.&M;

The main processing in WhereDelgProg() is triggered when you click on the OK
push botton.&P;  At this point, we must scan all of the control windows in the
dialog box and derive the search criteria--the file specification, the drives
to search through, and the optional date and size values.&P;  We then call the
WhereDriver() function to start the search operation.&M;

WhereDriver() clears the previous contents of the Found Files list box and
turns off its redraw flag.&P;  If this flag were left on, each successive string
added to the list box would cause a complete redisplay of the list box.&P;  So,
we turn the redraw flag back on after the search process is finished.&M;

Since the search operation may take some time, it's best to give you the
customary visible clue by changing the shape of the Windows mouse pointer
from an arrow to an hourglass.&P;  To change the cursor shape to an hourglass
and back we use the calls shown in Figure 4[C].&M;

FindFilesInDirectory() is the function that contains the actual search logic.&O;
It relies heavily on the information returned by the _dos_findfirst ( ) and
the _dos_findnext ( ) functions.&P;  These two functions are Microsoft's C
language interface to MS-DOS's Interrupt 21h, functions 4E and 4F.&P;  To search
for a group of files that match a certain specification, you must first call
the _dos_findfirst ( ) function.&P;  You pass _dos_findfirst ( ) the file
specification string, the attribute bits that the files must possess, and a
pointer to a find_t structure.&P;  The fields in hte find_t structure and hte
attribute values are shown in Figure 5.&P;  If _dos_findfirst ( ) finds a file
that matches the specification and has the desired attributes, it returns the
value 0 to the program.&P;  The find_t structure is then also filled in with
information about that file.&P;  After processing the first hit, _dos_findnext (
) is then called in a loop to search for more files.&P;  The loop should be
terminated when _dos_findnext ( ) returns a nonzero value.&P;  Note that
_dos_findnext ( ) also fills the find_t structure with information about the
found files.&M;

WINWHERE tells _dos_findfirst ( ) and _dos_findnext ( ) to find all normal
files, that is, files that have no attributes (neither the Archive bit nor
the Read-Only bit is set) but that match the desired file specification.&P;  If
you have added size or date limitations to the search, the size or date
fields of the find_t structure are compared with the values you requested.&O;
If the search criteria are satisfied, the name of the file is added to the
Found Files list box.&M;

After the first-round search for normal files, the _dos_findfirst() and
_dos_findnext ( ) functions are called again, this time to locate matching
files in all of the subdirectories contained under the current directory.&O;
FindFilesInDirectory() is called recursively for each such subdirectory, if
any.&M;

When the entire searching operation is done, we restore the original mouse
pointer, reenable the OK push button, and turn the redraw flag for the Found
Files list box back on.&P;  You can read this list box and then generate a batch
file that contains a command for files in the list.&M;

ENHANCEMENTS&M;

I think you'll find that WINWHERE is a powerful tool that will greatly
enhance your Windows environment--especially if you're the kind of user who
likes to stay in Windows all day long.&P;  At first glance, I don't see much
that you're likely to want to add to WINWHERE--but I also know that user
ingenuity is boundless, so feel free to "max it out" with more features.&P;  You
may want to enhance the search criteria with a choice of DOS file attributes
(to find all hidden and system files, for example), and file time (for
example, to find all files modified in the past hour).&P;  You might also add a
second value to the date and the size criteria so that you could define a
lower and upper limit to the range of search values (to find all files
between 1,000 and 2,000 bytes in size, for example).&P;  But these are exercises
left for the reader!&M;
