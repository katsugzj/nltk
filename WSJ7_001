   John Blair &amp; Co. is close to an agreement to sell its TV station advertising representation operation and program production unit to an investor group led by James H. Rosenfield, a former CBS Inc. executive, industry sources said. 

   Industry sources put the value of the proposed acquisition at more than $100 million. 
John Blair was acquired last year by Reliance Capital Group Inc., which has been divesting itself of John Blair's major assets. 
John Blair represents about 130 local television stations in the placement of national and other advertising. 

   Mr. Rosenfield stepped down as a senior executive vice president of CBS Broadcasting in December 1985 under a CBS early retirement program. 
Neither Mr. Rosenfield nor officials of John Blair could be reached for comment.

   The maker of furniture and fabrics said it earlier expected first-quarter net to exceed the year-ago profit, but snowstorms in January and February forced the company to close some manufacturing facilities for as long as six days. 
The closings reduced operating profit, but that was substantially offset by reduced interest expenses, the company said. 

   Stanley said it doesn't anticipate a permanent loss of sales because of the closings. 
Substantially all the delayed shipments should be made in the second quarter, the company said.

   The anticipated loss will stem from plans of a subsidiary, Eskey Inc., to sell the assets and business of its Yale E. Key Inc. unit to a group of that company's managers and a private investor for about $15.5 million. 
Yale E. Key is a well-service concern. 

   In the year-ago third quarter, Yankee had net income of $762,000, or 12 cents a primary share, on revenue of $51.6 million. 
Earnings included a $615,000 write-down of an investment. 

   Yankee, an energy and financial services concern, said the sale is part of its plan to focus on its core businesses and reduce its total indebtedness. 
The company expects the sale to be completed later this month, but said it still requires a definitive agreement.

   BankEast Corp. said it signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire First Federal Bank of Nashua, N.H., for about $35 million. 

   In the proposed transaction, each of First Federal's common shares would be converted into $60 of BankEast common stock. 
BankEast said each First Federal common share would be swapped for 2.9 to 3.5 BankEast common shares. 
This is subject to certain adjustments, including ones based on First Federal's earnings before the closing date, BankEast said. 

   First Federal, which has about $270 million in assets, currently has 566,100 common shares outstanding. 
BankEast has about 10 million common shares outstanding and assets of $1.05 billion. 

   John Snow, BankEast's president, said his company has been interested in the Nashua market. 
The acquisition provides "an opportunity for BankEast to develop more substantially in that market," he said. 
"We now have a relatively small presence there." 
BankEast said it hopes to complete the acquisition by year's end. 

   John O'Brien, First Federal president, said he regards BankEast as a "very good banking organization." 
He said BankEast's offer appears to be "attractive to the bank's shareholders." 

   First Federal's shareholders still must vote on the acquisition, which also requires the execution of a definitive agreement and approval from regulators. 

   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, BankEast shares fell 25 cents to $16.50.

   Ohio Edison Co., seeking to lessen the financial impact of the Perry nuclear plant, said it completed a sale-leaseback transaction for a portion of its ownership in the plant. 

   Under the arrangement, the utility sold about 30% of its stake in one of the northern Ohio plant's two reactors -- the 1.2 million-kilowatt Unit 1 -- to a group of institutional investors led by Citicorp, a New York bank holding company. 
Ohio Edison owns about 30% of the unit. 

   Ohio Edison said the investors will pay it $509 million for the stake, then lease it back for 29 years at a rate estimated at 8.5% to 9% of the cash payment. 

   The Perry plant, whose ownership is split among several utilites, has been dogged by construction delays and cost overruns. 
Ohio Edison's outside auditors, citing uncertainties over whether the utility could recover the construction costs of the plant, qualified both its 1985 and 1986 financial statements. 

   Ohio Edison said the proceeds from the sale will finance the balance of its 1987 construction program and repay bank loans incurred for the retirement of high-interest, long-term debt. 
The utility added that it plans later this year to ask the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to allow it to recover the cost of Perry. 

   Ohio Edison said the transaction will allow the equity investors to take advantage of federal tax benefits.

   Texaco Inc. said it reorganized certain of its oil-exploration operations. 

   The energy concern said it formed a "frontier exploration" department that will initiate and evaluate highly speculative oil opportunities for the company. 

   Frontier exploration was previously carried out by each of the company's regional divisions. 
Texaco said the consolidation of these operations will allow the geographic divisions to focus on the more mature, established oil basins. 

   Clarence P. Cazalot, 36 years old, was named general manager of the new department. 
He was formerly assistant to James W. Kinnear, Texaco chairman.

Decline in Net, Sales

   Canrad Inc. expects declines in first-quarter net income and sales, but increases in the full year, according to Carl Krieger, chief executive officer. 

   For the current quarter, Canrad, a maker of microwave equipment and ultraviolet lamps and systems, projects net income of about $120,000, or 10 cents a share, a 70% decline from year-earlier net of $409,000, or 34 cents a share, adjusted for a recent 5% stock dividend. 
Sales are expected to decrease about 8% to $8.5 million from $9.2 million a year earlier. 

   A drop in incoming orders for its microwave-equipment products used in the telecommunications industry is the major reason for Canrad's poor performance in the first quarter, Mr. Krieger said. 
Microwave equipment is the company's largest selling item as well as its most profitable, he noted. 

   Sales of the company's two other major products -- ultraviolet lamps and motion picture projection equipment -- are ahead of previous estimates, he said. 

   In spite of the poor performance in the first quarter, Canrad expects overall earnings and sales for 1987 to be higher than the previous year. 
Mr. Krieger forecasts that earnings will increase about 7% to $1.6 million, or $1.40 a share, from $1.5 million, or $1.29 a share, in 1986. 
Sales are expected to increase about 10% to $40 million from $36.6 million in 1986. 

   Mr. Krieger said that microwave equipment sales should be sharply higher in the second and third quarters.

   OKC Limited Partnership said a federal appeals court in New Orleans upheld a $21.5 million judgment against the company. 

   As reported last April, a federal district court in New Orleans ruled against OKC in a 1981 lawsuit filed by Aminoil USA Inc., now part of Phillips Petroleum Co. 
The court ruled that OKC hadn't paid Aminoil its full share of profits from an offshore petroleum lease that Aminoil had farmed out to OKC. 
The court ordered OKC to pay Phillips the profits, plus interest, which currently total about $21.5 million. 

   OKC said it plans to file a motion for a rehearing in an attempt to overturn the decision, but the company said its chances of winning a rehearing are "remote." 

   The company said it doesn't expect the ruling to have a major impact on earnings because it had already set aside about $14 million in reserves to cover the judgment and reached an agreement for a bank loan to pay the balance.

   The food wholesaler and retailer said the new budget is down primarily because the previous budget included funding for such major projects as new distribution centers at New Stanton, Pa., and Hammond, La. 

   The company said the new budget provides for significant additions to a number of its distribution centers, for upgrading computer equipment, for 10 new ShopKo discount department stores and for $70 million in financing for its independent retailer customers. 

   Super Valu said the largest portion of the budget, $181.8 million, or 55%, will be allocated to its retail support operations.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave its staff the authority to allow Consumers Power Co. to return its Palisades nuclear power plant to service after a 10-month shutdown for safety work. 

   The reactor has been idle since last May 19 when turbine problems triggered an automatic shutdown, said Joseph Fouchard, an NRC spokesman. 
Inspectors found three key safety-related valves failed to operate properly that day. 
Mr. Fouchard said the reactor shutdown "culminated a history of operating problems" at Palisades, on Lake Michigan near South Haven, Mich. 

   A spokesman for Jackson, Mich.-based Consumers Power said, "We're pleased. 
It brings the plant one step closer to restart." 
He said the company is "confident" that the NRC staff will allow the utility to restart the plant once Consumers Power has satisfactorily completed certain tests. 

   The commission voted 5-0 to authorize its staff to permit a restart after the staff reported on improvements in plant maintenance.

   SCANDINAVIAN AIRLINES SYSTEMS, or SAS, will defer for several more months a decision on whether to switch its order for 12 new airplanes to AIRBUS INDUSTRIE of Europe from MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORP. of the U.S. 

   Ulf Abrahamsson, SAS's vice president for fleet planning, said the carrier wants to study more carefully offers from the two aircraft builders. 
He said SAS also wants to determine the outcome of talks that could lead to the liberalization of air travel between the U.S. and Scandinavia. 

   SAS hopes to receive approval from U.S. authorities to fly to an unlimited number of American destinations, instead of the four U.S. cities it currently can serve. 
But Mr. Abrahamsson denied that SAS was trying to use the jet order to pressure the U.S. 

   SAS signed a letter of intent last December to purchase 12 McDonnell Douglas MD-11 jets for an estimated $1.6 billion. 
But in January it received a proposal from Airbus that it buy the European consortium's A-340 jets. 
It said then that it would make a final decision by late March. 

   However, Mr. Abrahamsson said Friday that the decision will be put off for "a number of months." 

   The new planes, which would be delivered in the early 1990s, are to replace SAS's fleet of DC-10s, which at decade's end will total 11.

   British government bond prices advanced 1 2/32 Friday as the market continued to consolidate recent gains. 

   Dealers reported a little profit-taking by domestic institutions and some unwinding of positions by major market-makers who had prepared themselves for further Japanese buying overnight. 
As it happened, Far Eastern interest was limited. 

   Analysts said the market's performance was very resilient considering the nearly four-point rally it staged following the release last week of Britain's fiscal 1988 budget. 

   Fixed-rate Eurodollar bonds were unchanged to up 1/8 point on light turnover. 

   Most dollar-denominated issues are suffering from a lack of interest, traders said. 
Investors remain skeptical about the dollar's prospects, and recent data haven't presented a clear picture of where the U.S. economy stands. 

   Eurodollar bonds closed little changed and Morgan Guaranty Ltd. tested a novel approach for repackaging perpetual floating-rate Euronotes. 

   In new issues, Morgan Guaranty took $130 million of a total of $500 million of perpetual floating-rate notes issued by Westpac Banking Corp., a large Australian bank, and restructured the issue into two new securities: a 15-year floating-rate note, and a 15-year zero-coupon bond. 

   The new 15-year floating-rate issue, priced at 100.10, adjusts semi-annually at 50 basis points above the six-month London interbank offered rate. 
The zero-coupon class, priced at 20, converts into the underlying Westpac perpetual floating-rate note at maturity. 

   Deutsche mark government and Eurobond prices were up about 1/8 to 1/4 point, falling back after gaining as much as 1/2 point on fairly widespread buying interest at the start. 

   Dealers said most of the buying had come from Japanese investors, who had sought government bonds with 1996 and 1997 maturities. 

   Swiss Franc foreign bonds closed little changed as the recent rise in Swiss interest rates continues to limit participation.

Washington Is Facing New Challenges
In East Asia on Trade and Diplomacy

<DATELINE> WASHINGTON </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gone are the days when the U.S. could quietly enjoy looking at East Asia as its foreign-policy trophy case. 

   The new Japans -- Taiwan and South Korea -- were thriving economically. 
China had shunned the Soviets and befriended Washington at small cost to Taiwan. 
A year ago, Washington came out of the Philippines mess smelling as sweet as that country's fresh democracy. 

   Now, however, foreign trade strains, political turmoil in South Korea, the Philippines' growing pains, China's turn back toward Communist orthodoxy and Moscow's new diplomatic efforts in the area suddenly have created what State Department officials call "the new East Asia challenge." 

   One problem is that economic growth in much of the region hasn't been accompanied by political maturity. 
The U.S. challenge is to help prevent its friends' growing pains from becoming geopolitical nightmares. 
"We've got to be prepared and look ahead," says Sen. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), chairman of the subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs. 

   The U.S. must stress to leaders like South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan that long-term stability can only be ensured through democracy, not by force. 
It must increase its quiet diplomatic pressure on East Asian states like Taiwan and South Korea to adjust their currencies and open their markets or risk U.S. protectionism that could cause political strains. 

   "We are in a transitional phase," says Richard Holbrooke, formerly a top State Department official and currently a managing director at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. 
"The economies in the region have been the strongest in the world, but political stability must be maintained or their economic successes will suffer." 
He says the U.S. should focus its efforts on areas where it can have the most impact: helping South Korea create democracy and assisting the Philippines in defending it. 

   South Korea is approaching what the U.S. hopes will be its first peaceful transition of power in February 1988, just seven months before the Summer Olympics there. 
Both the government and the opposition have refused to compromise on election reform. 
The U.S. has thus far balked at pressing the government too hard, fearful that too quick a shift to full democracy could itself be destabilizing. 
But unless it does so, President Chun is likely to create a succession scenario that leaves the leadership under the military's influence. 

   American officials believe long-term stability in the Philippines can only be ensured through more economic and military aid. 
"The country needs some pump priming," says J. Brian Atwood, a former State Department official who is now president of the National Democratic Institute. 

   Mr. Holbrooke believes banks should move quickly to sort out the Philippines debt problems to open doors for more foreign investment and borrowing. 
Mr. Atwood believes more weapons and funds for the military also are necessary: "If there is going to be a single source of instability, it will be the loyalty of the military." 

   Trade tensions are a growing concern. 
"If we get into a broad-front trade war, it could slow everyone down and change the political climate dramatically," a State Department official says. 
U.S. protectionist moves against Asian countries could slow economic growth and breed anti-Americanism in the region. 

   A senior official says the U.S. needs to stress that it won't accept only a marginal appreciation in the South Korean and Taiwanese currencies against the dollar at a time when the Japanese yen has appreciated quickly. 
Though Japanese products have become more expensive in the U.S., there hasn't been a corresponding narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit because, in many cases, South Korea and Taiwan products, which don't have the same price disadvantage, have taken their place. 

   The Communist powers in Asia also present challenges. 
Washington must lower its expectations of China as Beijing becomes more wary of Western ways. 
U.S. officials believe China could assume a more neutral position between the two superpowers, particularly if Beijing's rising star, Vice Premier Li Peng, a Soviet-trained engineer who favors strong economic central planning, takes over as premier as many expect. 
Moscow hasn't scored the huge diplomatic success it is seeking with Beijing, but U.S. officials worry about Mikhail Gorbachev's proclivity for unexpected diplomatic actions. 

   In Mr. Gorbachev "we are facing a creative chess master," says Mr. Atwood. 
"He is willing to move into new areas and take risks, be creative and keep us off balance."

Lac said it completed mining of the present ore body. 

   Lake Shore, in production since 1983, accounted for 10,600 ounces, or about 2.2%, of Lac's 1986 gold output of 479,264 ounces. 
The company said it doesn't expect the suspension to affect its earnings. 

   Lac said it will continue a $2.5 million surface-exploration program this year to determine whether further underground exploration is warranted. 
The suspension will affect 44 hourly and salaried employees, Lac said.

   Transamerica Corp. said it agreed to sell its group insurance operations to Chattanooga, Tenn.-based Provident Life &amp; Accident Co. 

   Last month, the two companies canceled a previously reported letter of intent covering acquisition of the group operations. 
They cited a disagreement over terms, but said talks would continue. 
The previous terms weren't ever disclosed. 
The transaction is expected to be completed by May 1. 

   The insurance and financial services concern said the sale to Provident Life is structured as a reinsurance transaction, under which Provident will assume responsibility for an estimated $400 million of policies and other liabilities. 
Transamerica said it would record a $75 million net gain on the sale. 

   But it said the gain would be largely offset by a charge to cover a change in accounting for amortizing deferred policy acquisition costs being made by its Transamerica Life Cos. unit. 
The company said the accounting change reflects a desire to "state our books as conservatively as we can." 

   Separately, Transamerica said that its board authorized the buyback of as many as 2.2 million common shares, or about 3% of its 72.7 million shares outstanding. 
The planned stock buyback is in addition to a previous buyback authorization, under which the company still plans to acquire as many as 1.5 million shares. 

   The company said the buybacks will be used for employee benefits and stock-option plans.

Homework Gets Poor Marks</HL>

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<IN> LABOR
TEXTILES AND APPAREL (TEX) </IN>
<TEXT>
   Joseph Perkins's defense of industrial homework (editorial page, March 6) was correct on only one point: that employers use it to lower costs so they can underprice competitors. 
The employer unfairly passes on his overhead for rent, machinery, repairs and electricity to the worker; piece rates invariably yield below the minimum wage in homework settings; benefits are unheard of, and even statutory benefits, such as Social Security, workers' compensation and unemployment compensation, are typically evaded. 

   The only disadvantage for the employer, apart from the illegality, is quality control, since homework makes supervision and investment in sophisticated machinery impossible. 
However, employers have a simple, if crude, method of quality control -- they don't pay for garments that don't meet standards or they send them back to be redone for no extra pay. 

   Knowing how advantageous homework is to the unscrupulous employer, Mr. Perkins should have known better than to fall for Norma Kamali's fairy tale about the wonderful wages and conditions of her homeworkers. 
The Kamali homeworkers with whom ILGWU organizers have spoken at length tell a very different story. 

   It was Miss Kamali who asked her workers to take work home, not vice versa. 
Miss Kamali's homeworkers were paid piece rates that yielded $2 an hour and less. 
They received no benefits, and were ineligible for unemployment compensation when Miss Kamali had no work. 
The low piece rates forced them to work long hours, and one had her children help sew. 

   Mr. Perkins implies that there was a positive determination that there were no violations of the minimum wage. 
In fact, no investigation was completed, but one is under way. 
Departments of labor often do not charge illegal homework employers because minimum-wage violations are nearly impossible to prove. 
Record-keeping is nonexistent and homeworkers are frightened to speak up, knowing that they may lose the little income they have or, in the case of undocumented workers, risk exposure to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
The inability to enforce labor standards is the reason homework was banned in 1942 and 1943 in seven apparel-related industries. 

   Mr. Perkins asserts that sweatshop conditions are "very rare today." 
In fact, a resurgence of the sweatshop began in major cities in the latter 1970s, fueled by highly competitive conditions in the import-battered garment industry and a vulnerable work force of recent immigrants. 
In the 1980s, farm distress has brought similar conditions to rural America. 

   Mr. Perkins accuses our union of forcing manufacturers to go overseas by "raising the cost of doing business in this country." 
The ILGWU has fought for fair trade for many years, for precisely the same reason we fight against homework. 
We do not believe that American workers should be forced to compete with inhumane standards. 
Union garment workers earn modest wages -- about $6 an hour -- but they cannot compete with workers overseas earning 50 cents and less or with homeworkers who make $2 and pay their own overhead. 
America cannot be strong if "competitiveness" is regained on the backs of workers paid poverty wages to work long hours in sweatshop conditions.

   Garment Workers' Union

   ---
   Particularly disturbing to me was Mr. Perkins's assertion that homework violations are trivial and seldom produce charges of wage underpayment. 
It is important to understand that record-keeping violations are not minor infractions; records are essential to ensure that homeworkers receive the legal protection to which they are entitled. 

   While Mr. Perkins accurately stated that a 1983 court ruling allowed the Department of Labor to rewrite its homework regulations, he neglected to point out that the court questioned government's ability to enforce the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) in the seven apparel industries covered by the regulatory prohibition. 
The court identified four impediments to the effective enforcement of the minimum wage among homeworkers: difficulty in locating and identifying workers; inadequate or nonexistent record-keeping; difficulty in establishing and remedying violations, and the strain on governmental resources. 

   The impediments remain. 
After hearings last fall, our subcommittee concluded that repealing the ban on industrial homework constitutes an abdication of the department's FLSA responsibilities. 

   Miss Kamali should be aware that this country will not allow any industry to blackmail workers with the threat of job exportation. 
Mr. Perkins must recognize the real threat of industrial homework -- an unprotected and exploited work force.

   In your tongue-in-cheek article on Atlanta as the site of the 1988 Democratic National Convention (page one, Feb. 13), you described the Carter Presidential Center, noting that it "houses the papers of the last Democratic president." 
It is assumed, for the sake of the efforts and aspirations of the delegates to the convention, that the author meant "the latest Democratic president." 
Or does he expect the Democrats to go the way of the Federalists, of which John Adams was the last to achieve the presidency?

   As an Atlanta native, recently exiled to Chicago, I could not help but wonder at your qualifications for judging barbecue. 
While you ferreted out such political hot spots as Manuel's Tavern (in the finest journalistic tradition), it boggles the mind that you missed the famous second state capital: Harold's Barbecue at 171 McDonough Blvd. in Southeast Atlanta. 
Or Sprayberry's Barbecue in Newman, 30 miles south of Atlanta off Highway I85. 
While, as you note, the taxi problem deserves immediate attention, Atlantans do tend to take barbecue more seriously, and we rate our native recipes over those of other, less refined, Southern states.

   In the controversy on these pages over who should be enshrined in the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame (arts page, Feb. 2; letters, Feb. 19), the terms "rock 'n' roll" and "rock" were often used interchangeably. 
There is quite a difference. 
True rock 'n' roll is the music generated and performed during the rock 'n' roll era, primarily from the mid-1950s to the very early 1960s. 
On the other hand, "rock" is a generic term given to the music of the kids in any subsequent era: surf rock, hard rock, acid rock, heavy-metal rock and so on, with rock 'n' roll being the first generation of such music. 
All inductees into the Hall of Fame should be from the rock 'n' roll era. 
If performers from soul, blues, surf and other genres are to be included, the title of the institution should be the Rock Music Hall of Fame.

   Frank B. Hall &amp; Co. reported a narrower fourth-quarter loss and said its auditors qualified its financial statements because of two pending lawsuits. 

   For the fourth quarter, the insurance-brokerage company posted a loss of $26.3 million, compared with a loss of $87.4 million in the year-earlier quarter. 
Revenue rose 11% to $99.3 million from $89.4 million. 

   Latest results included $24.2 million in losses from discontinued operations. 
During the quarter, the company decided to sell its unprofitable claims adjusting and automobile dealer insurance services operations. 
Year-earlier results included a charge of $85 million, mainly stemming from losses at its discontinued Jartran Inc. truck-rental unit. 

   For the year, the company had a loss of $22.5 million, compared with a loss of $190.5 million in 1985 that included $192 million in charges for Jartran and other discontinued operations. 
Revenue rose 8.4% to $390.9 million from $360.5 million in 1985. 

   A spokesman for Hall said Touche Ross &amp; Co., the auditors, qualified the company's financial statements because of uncertainty over the outcome of the lawsuits. 
In the first suit, New York State's Superintendent of Insurance is seeking $140 million in damages because of alleged fraud in the collapse of a Hall unit, Union Indemnity Insurance Co. 

   In the second suit, a unit of Mutual of Omaha Insurance Co. is seeking damages of $150 million from the company in a dispute over reinsurance agreements between the two concerns. 

   With regard to the lawsuits, Hall said it has "meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously defend" itself.

   My research, which often involves criticism of insurance practices I consider improper, is intended for the benefit of the public. 
The research I have conducted on the Williams organization during the past six years has been independent, as has my research on other insurance topics. 
The opinions I have expressed about the organization are mine, as are the opinions I have expressed about other insurance topics. 

   My research has been motivated by outrage concerning the tactics of the organization. 
I believe it is against the public interest for part-time representatives to advise consumers on a financial service as important as life insurance, for life-insurance policies to be replaced indiscriminately, for an organization to make its relatively high-cost insurance appear low in cost through deception, and for competitors to be intimidated with threatening letters.

   The rate increase will apply equally to residential, commercial and industrial customers of the utility. 
Hydro-Quebec had sought approval for an average 4.6% rate increase but had proposed that the residential rate rise 4.9% and other rates 4.4%. 

   The government said that a uniform rate increase would be fairer to small consumers. 
The utility said it expects an additional $109 million (Canadian) in 1987 revenue from the rate increase. 

   Hydro-Quebec earned $303 million on revenue of $4.73 billion in 1986.

To Proceed With Veba Sale</HL>

   The West German government said it will proceed today with the sale of its remaining 25.55% stake in VEBA AG, an energy, chemicals and trading group. 

   A spokesman for Deutsche Bank AG, one of the banks leading the placement, said the government's 10.1 million nominal shares will be priced at the equivalent of $136.70 each, converting the West German mark at its current rate, bringing the issue's total value to $1.38 billion. 
The issue is one of Germany's biggest. 

   The shares will be sold at a small discount to Veba's market price. 
Veba rose 82 cents, to $138.65, on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange Friday. 

   The announcement late Friday contradicted rumors earlier last week that the Finance Ministry would postpone the sale because of the recent drop in German share prices. 

   The government announced the sale of its Veba holding in January, when it expected to receive the current equivalent of between $147.65 and $169.50 for each share. 
That would have valued the holding at between $1.49 billion and $1.71 billion. 
But German share prices subsequently entered a prolonged slump. 

   The center-right government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl has in recent years returned several large industrial stakes to the public sector. 
In 1984, the Bonn government lowered its stake in Veba to the current 25.55% from 43.75%. 

   The government had planned to sell a 16% stake in Volkswagen AG later this year, but following news of an alleged foreign-exchange fraud that cost the auto maker as much as $259 million, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said that the sale may be put off. 

   The Veba shares will be placed through a consortium of 38 German and 33 foreign banks. 
About 20% of the government stake will be sold to foreigners.

   Yasser Arafat sends him magazines. 
Ronald Reagan sends him a typed list of all his film roles. 
Moammar Gadhafi sends him a book. 
Ferdinand Marcos writes back to him. 
So does Lee Iacocca and a Saudi Arabian king. 

   No, it's not Frank Sinatra. 
The recipient of all this attention is 52-year-old Henry Lohrengel Jr. of Kansas City, Mo., who has spent most evenings for the past 17 years deciding who among the rich and famous he would like to contact. 
And -- with the exception of Farrah Fawcett and Ayatollah Khomeini -- the rich and famous seem happy to answer. 

   Mr. Lohrengel works days as a mail clerk. 
But at night, he becomes a paparazzo, a photographer of celebrities. 
That job, however, carries him no farther than his living room and the recliner in front of his television set. 
By his side is a tripod with a camera and a cable that ends in a plunger. 
When a celebrity comes on the screen who captures his fancy, "I squeeze the trigger," he says. 

   He then sends the photograph to the celebrity -- and waits. 
Almost all his subjects autograph the picture and send it back to him, sometimes accompanied by books and magazines and whatnot. (He's still waiting to hear, however, from Ms. Fawcett and the Ayatollah.) 

   Just a few of his most prized contacts include Lucille Ball, Imelda Marcos and Elizabeth Taylor. 
A photo he sent to actress Ingrid Bergman was returned with an autograph -- and a second photo of Ms. Bergman. 
"She thought (mine) was a bit fuzzy," he says. 
His approach never seems to fail. 
"I've got a lot of millionaires and even a few billionaires," he says, not to mention "a lot of knights and dukes." 

   Mr. Lohrengel says few people besides his mother and co-workers at the Army Corps of Engineers are familiar with his collection, which includes more than 1,500 photos stuffed into albums, shoe boxes and closets. 
One day, however, he hopes to donate his work to a museum. 

   Though he refuses to name a favorite, Mr. Lohrengel admits to framing one picture, which hangs in his living room. 
It is a signed photo of Ronald Reagan as he appeared in the film "Prisoner of War," which Mr. Lohrengel says he saw on television in 1980, when Mr. Reagan was running for president. 

   But why doesn't he use a more recent photo? 
"I don't really watch him that much" anymore, he says, "because I already have" a good picture of him.

   Financial regulators closed several thrifts and banks over the weekend, including a Texas savings and loan association with $1.4 billion in assets. 

   Vernon Savings &amp; Loan Association, Vernon, Texas, was closed and nearly all of its assets and deposits were transferred to a newly chartered institution to be run by federal regulators. 
The Texas S&amp;L commissioner closed Vernon after finding that the thrift was insolvent and had "substantially dissipated its assets through unsafe and unsound practices." 

   Vernon was a state-chartered institution with nine offices in Texas and one office in Oklahoma. 
The new institution, of the same name, will be headquartered in Dallas and begin operations today under management appointed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which took over the failed thrift. 

   The Bank Board said that 96%, or $1.3 billion, of Vernon's loans were more than 60 days delinquent. 
The Bank Board said that Vernon dissipated its assets by paying excessive compensation and dividends to its major officers and shareholders, and purchasing a beach house and five airplanes for the use of executives. 

   In the past five years, Vernon's assets increased more than tenfold, the Bank Board said. 
The association's growth was fueled by solicitation of high-cost brokered deposits and so-called jumbo certificates of deposit. 
"Most of the proceeds of the association's deposit solicitation campaign were used to fund large speculative acquisition, development and construction loans," the Bank Board said in a release. 

   Separately, the Bank Board closed First Federal of Maryland, Hagerstown, because of insolvency. 
It had assets of $115 million. 
The thrift's four offices will reopen today as branches of Columbia First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, Washington, D.C., which took over its insured deposits. 

   First Southern Savings Association of Jackson County, Pascagoula, Miss., also was closed over the weekend because it was insolvent. 
First Southern was a state-chartered stock association with $50 million in assets and three offices. 
First Southern's insured deposit accounts were transferred to Magnolia Federal Bank for Savings, Hattiesburg, Miss. 

   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. provided funds to assist in the acquisition of Bayou Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, New Orleans. 
First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, also of New Orleans, acquired Bayou Federal, which had $26 million in assets. 
It was the seventh FSLIC-assisted transaction this year. 

   Morocco State Bank, Morocco, Ind., was closed by state regulators and reopened on Saturday as a branch of DeMotte State Bank, DeMotte, Ind., the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said. 
Morocco had assets of $15 million and deposits of $14 million. 

   On Friday state banking authorities also closed Madill Bank &amp; Trust Co., Madill, Okla. 
Its two offices will reopen today as branches of First American National Bank of Tishomingo, Okla. 
Madill had total assets of $37 million when it was closed Friday by state banking authorities. 
First American will assume deposits of about $37 million in 7,200 accounts. 

   New City Bank, Orange, Calif., was closed Friday by state banking authorities. 
Its offices will reopen today as branches of Colonial Bank, a newly chartered national bank also in Orange. 
New City had assets of about $21 million. 

   The latest closures bring the number of banks to fail this year to 50.

<DATELINE> MELBOURNE </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taxation is fast becoming an issue in the run-up to the Australian federal election, likely to take place before the end of 1987. 

   Pressure for tax reform comes from a combination of high marginal tax rates on average incomes and rapid bracket creep. 
Come July, the three highest rates -- 43%, 46% and 55% -- will be replaced by two rates -- 40% and 49%. 
But most people will carry a heavier tax burden during 1987 because inflation, now running at an annual rate of 12%, will push them into higher brackets. 
By the end of 1987 the proportion of income earners paying tax at a marginal rate of 40% or more will have reached almost one-half; 10 years ago it was about one-fifth. 

   Hardly any of the participants in the tax debate, however, are taking account of the positive revenue effects of lower tax rates. 
Instead, it is widely assumed that income-tax cuts must be wholly financed by some combination of higher indirect taxes and cuts in public expenditure. 
This assumption virtually destroyed Prime Minister Bob Hawke's original tax-reform policies. 
His government held a "tax summit" in 1985 to secure consent for its plans for a broad-based consumption tax, deemed necessary to offset large cuts in income tax. 
The summit was a failure, since it was dominated by representatives of the many interests that stood to lose in the short term from any major shift to indirect taxation. 
Collectively they vetoed the consumption tax. 

   Trapped by its own analysis, the government made minor cuts in income-tax rates and introduced new and unpopular taxes on fringe benefits and capital gains. 
But having generated community interest in tax reform and having politicized so many interest groups with its summit, the government finds it has created a major issue without controlling the terms of the debate. 

   Recent events have served to focus the debate. 
First, the premier of the state of Queensland, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, has announced his intention to become Australia's next prime minister and to implement a 25% single-rate income tax without any increases in indirect tax. 
Sir Joh's ambitions have received a serious setback with the failure of his candidates to win a single seat in the March Northern Territory Assembly election. 
But the wave of popular support he has attracted across the nation has forced opponents to take the flat-rate-tax idea seriously. 

   Second, Treasurer Paul Keating has ended speculation that the Labor government was planning to repudiate the outcome of the 1985 tax summit, to introduce a consumption tax and to cut income-tax rates substantially. 
In February he announced that no major reforms were planned; he emphasized the need for tax stability at a time of economic difficulty, noting that a consumption tax would drive the inflation rate to disastrous levels. 
Given the government's commitment to holding expenditure at its existing level, the implication was that any revenue increases would be devoted exclusively to reducing the budget deficit. 
This is also the purpose of the expenditure-cutting financial statement the treasurer has since announced for May 14. 

   These priorities have been endorsed by a variety of Australians and organizations, from former deputy secretary to the Federal Treasury, Des Moore, to the Australian Institute for Public Policy and the Australian Chamber of Commerce. 
In "Mandate to Govern," a recent study published by the latter two groups, the argument was that spending cuts must come first. 
No doubt taxes are easier to reform in times of high economic growth. 
But then such growth will be slower to arrive without tax cuts, and when it does, the pressure for reform will be that much lower. 

   Another voice raised was that of the Centre of Policy Studies (COPS), an independent policy-research institute attached to Monash University, Melbourne. 
In February it published "Tax Reform -- the Next Steps," putting forth three options, all of which envisage a top marginal tax rate of 30%. 
This tax cut would be accompanied by a range of additional fiscal measures, including the removal of the existing tax-free threshold from high-income earners. 
The three options are as follows: abolishing the threshold and appropriately redesigning the social-security system; using the American method of recapturing the threshold by a 5% tax surcharge over a high-income range, or by a flat, broad-based consumption tax of 10%. 

   At the launching of the report, one of the authors noted that tax cuts should be partially self-financing through benign incentive and revenue effects. 
But the COPS strategy is based on the interlocking assumptions that tax cuts must be financed by expenditure cuts and that the voters will accept expenditure cuts only if they are compensated through tax cuts. 
The report recommends expenditure cuts of $3.42 billion ($5 billion Australian) for this particular purpose, and a further $2.05 billion to remove the current budget deficit. 

   But however questionable the former of these assumptions may be, the COPS report does provide a comprehensive and much-needed set of proposals for cutting the huge outlays on health, education and welfare. 
The structure of the Australian welfare state offers wide scope for such cuts. 
Although, like most Western welfare systems, it maintains the incomes of the poorest groups, it does so in a highly inefficient way. 
The steady accumulation of spending programs, especially those providing universal health and education services, has resulted in much tax revenue being simply churned back into the pockets of the same taxpayers. 
But since the middle-income groups stand to gain more in the immediate term from tax cuts than do the poor, it should in principle be possible to get them off the state welfare rolls and into private provision. 
This would enable governments to target public assistance to the needy. 

   The COPS report actually proposes spending cuts in excess of $8.9 billion. 
It finds $680 million from replacing free higher education with student fees of between $3,424 and $4,109 annually. 
Doing away with the universal Medicare scheme would save $6.8 billion, while preserving health-related benefits for the medically needy and the lower-income groups. 
Welfare savings of $1.37 billion could result from scrapping tax shelters for the well-off, from means-testing family allowances and from reforming the unemployment-benefit scheme. 
Finally, $342 million might be saved by eliminating job-creation schemes and training subsidies. 

   The next move is up to the opposition Liberal-National coalition, which has still not announced its tax policy. 
It could frustrate the government's hope of fighting the election on the issue of a consumption tax by adopting one of the COPS tax-cutting options that relies entirely on existing taxes. 
In addition, the coalition could advance the tax debate considerably by stressing the revenue increases that could be expected from lower tax rates. 
In this way it could avoid having its timetable of tax reductions retarded by the inevitably slow pace of expenditure cuts.

Wedtech's Fall Spurs Review
Of Minority Program at SBA

<TEXT>
   THE SCANDAL SURROUNDING New York-based defense contractor Wedtech Corp. has set the stage for congressional reviews of the Small Business Administration's controversial 8(a) procurement program. 
The program, which takes its name from the law that authorizes it, allows minority-owned businesses to obtain federal contracts without competitive bidding. 
The SBA awarded a total of $3 billion in such contracts last year. 

   This week, Rep. Nicholas Mavroules (D., Mass.), who chairs a subcommittee of the House Small Business Committee, will introduce legislation to revamp the 8(a) program to reduce the potential for abuse. 
"The goal is to preserve a worthwhile program, while addressing some obvious problems through meaningful reform," an aide to the congressman says. 
At the same time, the Senate Small Business Committee is considering holding hearings later this spring that could lead to similar legislation in that chamber. 

   The Wedtech case has rekindled debate about the 8(a) program, which since its inception in 1968 has been plagued periodically by allegations of abuse. 
The most recurrent problem has been the establishment of "front companies" ostensibly owned by minorities but in reality controlled by whites. 
In a 1979 investigation, for example, the SBA found that 20% of the 1,500 companies then participating in the program either weren't minority-controlled or weren't disadvantaged. 

   Misuse of funds has also been a problem. 
One company that obtained 8(a) contracts later bought a racehorse that caught a cold and died. 

   THOUGH THE ABUSES have been real, they have tainted the program's reputation to a degree that many feel is unwarranted. 
"The interest in the program is usually triggered when something negative is in the air," says Gordon G. Alexander, the Washington, D.C., representative of a business group, Black Corporate Presidents of New England. 
"That's unfortunate because these businesses are putting dollars into the economy." 

   Misunderstandings about the program also stem from the lack of any studies about its effectiveness in creating successful minority-owned businesses. 
Of the approximately 3,900 companies that have participated in the program, 915 have "graduated." 
But it isn't known how many of those graduates survived once they were forced to bid for work. 
The success rate should become clearer in the next month or so, when the staff of the Senate Small Business Committee is expected to complete a survey of 8(a) graduates. 

   A little over a year ago Wedtech was considered one of the program's success stories. 
The company had grown from a small machine shop into a major maker of pontoons, engines and other equipment that provided jobs for 1,200 workers in the economically devastated South Bronx. 
Over the years, Wedtech got $250 million of defense contracts under the 8(a) program. 

   BUT LAST YEAR, state and federal prosecutors began investigating questionable company payments to politically connected law firms and consultants. 
A special prosecutor is still investigating lobbying on Wedtech's behalf by former White House aide Lyn Nofziger. 
Eventually, Wedtech officials admitted bribing government officials, paying off unions, forging invoices to the government and defrauding shareholders. 
In December, the company sought court protection from creditors under the bankruptcy laws, halted operations and dismissed its workers. 

   Under new management, the company has since rehired about 280 workers and resumed limited production. 

   The legislation proposed by Rep. Mavroules is intended to eliminate the potential for many of the abuses attributed to Wedtech, while simultaneously strengthening SBA policies aimed at ensuring that young minority companies in the program ultimately can stand on their own. 

   On the side of preventing abuses, for example, the bill would increase fines for individuals who set up front companies to $300,000 from $50,000. 
It would sharply limit the number of political appointees at the SBA who make decisions about 8(a) awards. 
And it would bar SBA employees from owning stock in 8(a) companies. 

   On the business-development side, the legislation would double the length of time a company could participate in the program to 14 years. 
More significant, it would establish a three-phase process for weaning the company from dependence on the program. 

   INITIAL REACTIONS to Mr. Mavroules's bill generally have been favorable. 
"I think it would go a long way to preventing future Wedtechs," says Mr. Alexander, the representative of the black corporate presidents group. 
Adds Ella Mae Horse, an organizer of the National Native American Chamber of Commerce: "I think it can only help the minority contractors." 

   The Republican response to the Mavroules bill has been more qualified. 
Massachusetts Rep. Silvio O. Conte, the ranking Republican on the Mavroules subcommittee, says he supports the provisions cracking down on abuse. 
But through an aide, he expresses reservations about doubling the participation period. 
The aide says Mr. Conte intends to submit a bill of his own that would make significant changes in the 8(a) program, including eliminating the role the SBA plays as a middleman between procuring agencies and contractors. 

   Still, Mr. Conte says through a spokesman, "We think the time is right for 8(a) reform. 
We view it in one way. 
Mr. Mavroules views it another way. 
We're sure we can reach a compromise."

   Representative spokesmen for the town of Washington were saying after the president's Thursday evening news conference that it was workmanlike. 
Sounds a lot like the real world to us. 
If so, the rest of the country should welcome the president, the politicians and the press back to the daily work of making this country move in a forward direction. 

   There has been legitimate reason to wonder recently where we were all going. 
The cover of last week's New Republic headlined an article by Gail Sheehy: "Is Reagan Senile?" 
This is a partisan but not entirely off-the-wall question in light of Mr. Reagan's past several months -- major prostate surgery in January, the breaking of the Iranamok story, the president's extraordinarily inept news conference about the affair, months of staff turmoil at the White House. 
It was cause to wonder. 

   The country learned something important Thursday evening: The fellow answering the White House press corps' questions isn't senile. 
The senile-president hurdle was a large impediment to Ronald Reagan's forward progress. 
That hurdle is now behind him. 
One more remains: the North-Poindexter hurdle. 

   Thursday someone asked Mr. Reagan if at any time he had been told about or knew about the diversion of Iran-related funds to the contras. 
He said: "No. 
You would have heard me . . . if I had been told that at any time." 
When Messrs. 
North and Poindexter have immunity, they will either affirm or demolish Mr. Reagan's position. 
If they affirm, then Iranamok's political dimension, despite some residual damage, is over. 
The Reagan presidency will be free to move forward. 

   Notwithstanding the news conference's great interest in the Iran affair, other subjects came up -- the budget, taxes, SDI and the ABM treaty, Nicaragua. 
It would be a sign of renewed community health if Washington were now able to focus its energies on the substance as well as the surface of these issues. 

   We have come more and more to wonder whether the townspeople of Washington would rather deal with real issues that inhere in public policy or whether they would just as soon pirouette across the political surface of public events. 
There seems to be something about Ronald Reagan that creates an abiding interest in whether he personally will "stumble" over various policy matters. 

   Certainly the nation's interest should be larger than zero in whether the president "stumbles." 
But the nation should also know more about Mr. Reagan's Thursday night assertion that the Soviet Union had no intention in 1972 of letting its own missile-defense plans be constrained by the language or legal standing of the ABM treaty. 

   Similarly, the president renewed his promise to veto "tax-rate increases." 
Tax rates in the new tax code are of course what House Speaker Jim Wright wants to raise to solve Congress's struggles with budget reduction. 
Others in Washington don't much care where new revenues come from. 
Below the dancing politics of the budget, however, are substantive issues many people would surely be interested in. 

   The current budget is essentially a zero-sum accounting game, pitting special-interest coalitions against each other for what money is available. 
Again, we don't doubt that the degree of the president's steadfastness against taxes is itself a fascinating personal story. 
But the larger issue Mr. Reagan is raising here is whether the federal sector has arrived at the outer limits of its responsibilities and must now redeploy those duties among itself, the states and the private sector. 
If Congress can't let go, if it insists on some funding for all of its creations with "new" revenue, Washington will sink back into the swamp of special interests it's lived in for 15 years. 

   Beyond strategic defense and the budget, there is much else of importance to occupy the productive efforts of the president and Washington. 
There is trade friction with Japan, international monetary policy and debt management, the question of whether the U.S. wishes to integrate its financial and securities markets into the global market or withdraw behind a wall of regulations. 
There is the future of the farm-crop support system and the need for clarity on the issue of whether a second communist state off the U.S.'s southern border matters or is irrelevant. 

   Getting past the Iran affair, in short, is a precondition to getting the U.S. moving forward again. 
The president's news conference was a much-needed step in that direction.

   On Friday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave formal approval to the AIDS drug called AZT. 
This effectively means that any doctor may prescribe AZT, subject to availability, for any patient suffering from AIDS or its related diseases. 
The FDA's approval culminates one of the most dramatic episodes in the history of U.S. regulation of medical science. 

   In the new language of drug approval, AZT was "fast tracked." 
It was shoved through a regulatory-approval system that couldn't find a way to serve both the needs of the dying and the needs of bureaucracy. 
When AIDS became the biggest medical story of our time, the bureaucracy ran out of excuses and the federal government made sure that any drug showing real medical benefit would be sped through the regulatory apparatus. 
The result is Friday's approval of AZT. 

   And now tomorrow, the Food and Drug Administration should announce its approval of tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA. TPA is a bioengineered substance that is fed intravenously into a heart-attack victim. 
It seeks out the victim's blood clot and dissolves it, thereby renewing the critical flow of blood to the victim's heart and reducing destruction of the heart's tissue. 
In tests it has worked for many heart-attack victims. 
It should be approved. 

   In saying the FDA should approve this drug "tomorrow" we don't mean pretty soon. 
We mean tomorrow, March 24, 8:30 a.m. 

   Two years ago this week, the New England Journal of Medicine reported that a multicenter test of heart-attack victims and TPA had been abruptly halted that February by officials at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. 
They stopped the test because TPA was proving nearly two times as effective at opening clotted arteries (recanalization) as streptokinase, a drug that is already approved by the FDA. 
In its New England Journal article, the study's doctors wrote: "Tissue-type plasminogen activator can lead to recanalization . . . without the risk, cost or delay associated" with streptokinase. 

   That was two years ago. 
According to the American Heart Association's most recent annual figures, some 1.5 million Americans will have a heart attack; more than 500,000 will die of their heart attack. 
What possible reason can have justified denying TPA to those among this extraordinarily large number who would have benefited from it? 

   Why has AZT been approved while TPA hasn't been approved? 
AZT can have significant toxic side effects, but AIDS patients are willing to take that risk. 
TPA in recent studies has been associated with stroke caused by bleeding into the brain among 1% to 2% of the trial's patients. 
Surely many heart-attack patients would willingly assume that risk, just as seriously ill people accept low percentages of risk with serious surgical procedures. 
And over time, physicians will learn to reduce and manage such risks. 
Indeed, back in October 1985 a medical panel advising Blue Shield of California said TPA should be recognized "as acceptable medical practice." 

   Ten days ago, the FDA announced that within three months it would codify rules to speed the availability of promising experimental drugs. 
This important breakthrough in regulatory common sense may bring enormous benefit to this country's most seriously ill people. 
But Friday's approval of AZT shows that large needs don't have to wait for new rules. 
With well over a thousand Americans dying daily of heart attacks, the need for TPA is large and immediate.

It raced across the 2300 border Friday, closing at 2333.52. 
There had been fears that Friday's witching hour would cast a pall on this progress. 
It all reminds us of a young friend who spends hours with a difficult video game called Ultima III. 
The difficult trick is to get four of your men through endless horrors until each one reaches a level of strength adequate to carry them on to victory. 
Defeat from Ultima's monster can be immediate and swift.

To the players staring now at 2400 on the Big Board, take heart.

   A campaign by Dixons Group PLC to acquire Cyclops Corp. stalled as the British concern, facing a challenge from the Securities and Exchange Commission, had to reopen its tender offer for the Pittsburgh-based company. 

   London-based Dixons, an electrical appliance retailer, had claimed victory over a group of competing bidders after snaring 54% of Cyclops's 4.3 million shares outstanding with a $384 million, or $90.25-a-share, tender offer that expired Wednesday. 

   But Dixons, disclosing objections from the SEC, agreed on Friday to reopen its offer until 12:01 a.m. this Wednesday. 
The extension enables Cyclops holders who have already tendered their shares to recall them and tender to a competing group of bidders led by Audio/Video Affiliates Inc., a Dayton, Ohio-based consumer electronics retailer. 

   SEC objections revolved around Dixons's last-minute decision to waive a condition that 80% of shares outstanding be tendered, Dixons said. 
The British concern dropped the requirement Wednesday after its tender offer attracted only a modest majority of Cyclops shares. 

   Officials of Cyclops, a specialty steel maker and consumer appliance and electronics retailer, and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., which advised Dixons in the transaction, declined to comment. 
Dixons said in a prepared statement that it agreed to the extension "in order to settle the dispute and to expedite completion of the offer, although the company does not agree with the SEC's position." 

   Meanwhile, the bidding stakes for Cyclops heated up as the Audio/Video group raised its tender offer Friday to $92.50 a share. 
Among other things, the group conditioned its offer on receipt of the same confidential financial data Cyclops management provided Dixons. 

   In agreeing last month to be acquired by Dixons, Cyclops rebuffed an earlier bid of $80 a share from the Audio/Video group, which also includes Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd., a Citicorp unit. 

   "It's like trying to play poker with a deck of marked cards," Stuart Rose, Audio/Video chairman and chief executive officer, said of his group's inability so far to look at Cyclops's internal financial records. 
"I can't understand what the downside is in Cyclops' showing it to us," said Mr. Rose, adding that several Cyclops holders -- not Audio/Video -- had complained to the SEC about Dixons's waiver of the 80% tender requirement. 

   Reopening of Dixons's tender offer effectively postpones, for now, the British retailer's effort to take control of Cyclops. 
Shortly after its tender expired Wednesday, Dixons began moving to pay tendering holders and took charge of Cyclops's board, placing three Dixons executives on the board and accepting resignations from seven Cyclops directors. 

   Also on Friday, in a lawsuit filed by Audio/Video, a federal judge in Dayton, Ohio, denied the company's request for an order forcing Cyclops to provide Audio/Video with information provided to Dixons. 
Judge Walter H. Rice also denied a motion for a temporary restraining order that would enable Cyclops holders to recall shares previously tendered to Dixons. 

   Audio/Video's Mr. Rose said the latter request was moot following Dixons' extension of its tender. 
Dixons, terming the lawsuit "frivolous," said it will seek dismissal of the action. 

   Audio/Video's revised bid was announced as the stock market closed on Friday. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Cyclops shares rose $1.50, to $90.50. 

   The lure of Cyclops for both suitors is its Silo Inc. retailing division, which operates a nationwide chain of appliance and consumer electronics stores. 
Dixons plans to retain Silo and sell Cyclops's steel and nonresidential construction businesses. 

   Separately, Halcyon Investments, a New York securities partnership, said it bought a 7.1% stake in Cyclops's shares outstanding for investment purposes. 
In an SEC filing, the partnership said it holds 288,000 Cyclops shares, purchased Feb. 6 to March 13 for $84.189 to $93.262 each.

Backs Interest Rule
On Credit Cards

   A Canadian parliamentary committee proposed that credit-card issuers use a uniform method of calculating interest on credit-card balances. 

   The committee, in a report to Parliament, also urged the government to apply pressure to banks and other credit-card issuers to lower their "excessive" rates. 
But it said ceilings on interest rates shouldn't be imposed at this time. 

   Canada's minister of state for finance, Tom Hockin, welcomed the committee's report and said the government would act soon to enact some of the measures proposed by the House Commons Finance Committee. 

   The committee said its proposed standard method for calculating interest on credit-card balances should allow for a grace period, the period within which any credit extended may be repaid without incurring interest charges. 
The method would allow any partial payment to be credited toward the interest-bearing balance. 
And it would recognize the timing of payments, so that a payment made one day late wouldn't lead to financing charges for a full month. 

   The committee also called for wider and uniform disclosure of credit-card interest rates and other card terms to "improve the information consumers have about pricing" and promote competition. 

   Of 34 cards examined by the committee, annual interest charges in mid-March ranged from 10.25% to 28.8%. 
But the committee said that the numerous methods used to calculate interest and other fees makes it difficult for card holders to compare costs. 

   Although the committee didn't recommend interest-rate ceilings be enforced immediately, Reginald Stackhouse, a Progressive Conservative committee member, said ceilings could be imposed by Parliament as "a last resort." 

   Committee Chairman Don Blenkarn called on Canada's major banks to lower immediately their Visa and MasterCard rates by three percentage points, which he said was equivalent to a drop in rates announced recently by Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada's fifth largest bank. 

   In Toronto, a spokesman for Royal Bank of Canada, Canada's largest bank, said, "We feel our rate at the present level is competitive and acceptable." 
He said Royal Bank charges an 18.6% annual rate on its Visa credit-card holders' balances outstanding.

   Secretary of State Shultz is crying wolf in warning of a crisis if Congress cuts the administration's proposed $20 billion foreign-affairs budget for fiscal year 1988. 

   While it is too early to know how Congress will react, it is clear that given its need to meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit target, Congress is unlikely to approve more than this year's foreign-affairs budget of $17.3 billion and may cut even deeper. 
The current level is adequate to cover the most urgent needs, but only if Congress and the administration are willing to break loose from political constraints and allocate the limited funds to the most deserving programs. 

   Last year Congress lopped $4.2 billion off the administration's proposed foreign-affairs budget of $21.5 billion without anything very serious happening. 
While there were some substantial reductions within the foreign-aid programs that constitute more than three-fourths of the foreign-affairs budget, these cuts were more severe than necessary since neither Congress nor the administration was willing to take the political heat of cutting back the $5.3 billion going to Israel and Egypt. 

   Congress cut the largest slice -- $2.8 billion -- from security assistance. 
This includes foreign military sales (FMS) loans, military assistance, economic assistance for security-related purposes, and smaller programs for foreign military training and peace-keeping operations. 

   The greater part of the $2.8 billion saving, however, is more illusion than reality. 
While on the face of it Congress cut FMS financing $1.7 billion, this reduction was taken by eliminating $1.8 billion in Treasury-rate financing. 
Untouched were the $3.9 billion in concessional credits offered at subsidized rates, which are usually 2.5% to 3% below the cost of money to the Treasury. 

   This is a shell game at the expense of the taxpayer. 
While the cuts look good in the short run since total outlays are reduced and the budget balance is helped, over the long run deficits will be larger because of lower receipts. 

   The shift to concessional financing marks a further departure from the economic criteria that should be used to establish a country's need for military aid and the degree of concessionality it receives. 
This year and under the proposed 1988 budget, for example, Greece and Spain, countries whose economies have in the past been judged strong enough to pay the Treasury rate, will receive concessional loans. 

   Another worrisome trend is the increasing reliance on grant military aid. 
This is the most expensive form of military aid and was virtually eliminated during the Carter administration. 
Yet last year Congress approved $900 million in grant military aid, the highest level since the end of the Vietnam War. 
For fiscal 1988, the administration is requesting $1.3 billion. 

   This shift toward grants and concessional loans partly reflects an effort to compensate for reduced FMS financing by offering better terms. 
The shift also aims to avoid increasing the debt burdens some countries incurred when they took on large FMS loans financed by the Federal Financing Bank at high interest rates. 
As annual repayments on those loans become a serious burden for some countries, the clamor for debt relief has increased and defaults have dissipated the "Guaranty Reserve Fund" once maintained against such defaults. 

   Israel has the largest FMS debt burden ($1.1 billion in fiscal 1988) but it is essentially relieved of repayment since it receives economic-supporting assistance in the form of cash aid that is sufficient to cover its payments. 
Moreover, since payment of all of the $1.8 billion provided annually in new FMS financing is forgiven -- making it, in effect, a grant -- Israel is not building up any new FMS debts. 

   Egypt, like Israel, is not required to repay its $1.3 billion in new military aid. 
Only part of its $800 million in economic-supporting assistance, however, is in cash. 
This means that after meeting $500 million in payments on past military loans, Egypt has little U.S. economic aid left to support its economic development. 

   The Reagan administration has been searching for a debt-relief formula that would not trigger a general assault on the U.S. Treasury. 
Outright forgiveness has been rejected as too costly. 
The administration also rejected refinancing the $18 billion in outstanding FMS loans financed by the Federal Financing Bank because of the risk that it would open the door to refinancing the rest of the bank's $150 billion in outstanding, mostly domestic, loans. 

   As an alternative, the administration has proposed a "restructuring" of outstanding high-interest FMS loans that would bring interest rates down to the current 7% to 8% range. 
This proposal would bring near-term relief on interest payments, but the deferred interest would be added to the principal balance and would come due at the end of the payment period in 10 to 20 years. 
The borrowing countries would then face massive balloon payments that many might not be able to pay. 

   The administration is also offering countries that can afford to do so the option of pre-paying their high-interest FMS loans. 
This seems more likely to help the countries least needing relief (such as South Korea, Thailand, Greece and Spain) than those whose debt burdens are the most onerous. 

   The prospect that some countries will take advantage of the option to pay off their outstanding high-interest loans has near-term advantages for budget estimates. 
The 1988 budget, for example, assumes that the administration will be able to manage the "restructuring" so that the positive effects of prepayments will override the negative effects of reduced interest payments, giving a positive $26 million. 
This is in contrast to estimated shortfalls of $770 million in 1987 and $1.7 billion in 1989. 
Such are the government's ingenious schemes for manipulating deficit estimates. 

   Of the administration's proposed $20 billion foreign-affairs budget for 1988, $15 billion would go to foreign aid. 
Of that $15 billion, 38% is for development aid, up from the administration's request of 33% last year. 
This is due largely to a $435 million increase for multilateral development banks. (Bilateral development aid remains essentially unchanged at $3.3 billion.) 

   While this shift in favor of development aid appears to reflect a departure from the administration's past emphasis on security-related aid, it is probably more a response to Congress's tendency to cut security assistance more severely. 
Moreover, while the administration is requesting $1.4 billion less in security aid than last year, the saving is offset by greater concessionality. 
Outright grants increase from 75% to 85% and all FMS financing is at concessional interest rates. 

   Under Democratic leadership, Congress is not likely to favor an increase in security aid at the expense of bilateral development aid. 
The greatest cuts are likely to be made in security assistance and a proposed substantial increase for multilateral development banks -- a proposal that Rep. David Obey (D., Wis.), chairman of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee, said earlier this month "doesn't stand a chance of a snowball in hell." 

   Although it is unlikely to increase military grants by nearly 50%, as proposed by the administration, Congress might be tempted to go along with some increase in grants as well as greater concessionality in FMS loans, especially if the outlay effects can be masked by prepayments of past FMS loans. 

   But greater concessionality is a move in the direction of higher costs and prolonged dependency -- exactly the wrong direction for our security-assistance program. 
Instead, Congress should hold the line by rejecting any increase in security assistance, especially in grants, and by requiring that concessional FMS financing be offered only where economic criteria justify it. 

   Lacking any broad consensus on the purposes of foreign aid and unwilling to take on domestic supporters of key recipients such as Israel, Egypt and Greece, Congress is unlikely to give the administration much leeway in allocating the available funds. 
If, as seems all too likely, Congress cuts foreign aid again while maintaining current earmarks, it will further distort a program in which aid to Israel and Egypt equals U.S. bilateral and multilateral aid to the rest of the world. 

   But this is to be expected of a foreign-aid program that lacks a coherent rationale and is largely devoted to satisfying the efforts of special interests to protect the aid levels of a few favored countries. 
While congressional pressures on overall aid levels, coming largely from the budget and appropriations committees, have forced some overdue cuts, few knowledgeable persons in either the administration or Congress would argue that the resulting program represents a sound allocation of the limited resources available. 
Little is likely to be done about this in the dying years of the Reagan administration. 
But it is not too soon for Congress to initiate a comprehensive, critical reappraisal of foreign aid.

Hong Kong Stocks Are Volatile of Late,
But Boost From Local Economy Is Seen

   The British colony's stock market has displayed sharp volatility recently, after an easy climb to new heights earlier in the year. 

   In the first half of March, the Hang Seng index, which tracks 33 major stocks, plummeted more than 11% from the record 2939.05 registered March 3. 
The string of losses ended abruptly Wednesday, though, when the indicator rebounded nearly 95 points, or about 3.5%, in a single session. 
The index edged lower again Thursday but surged 59.27 points Friday to close the week at 2780.55. 

   Although earnings-related trading and overseas investors alike have played a role in the recent turbulence, essentially it is a transient, technical reaction to a February rally that saw the Hang Seng index climb nearly 15%, Hong Kong securities analysts say. 
Brokers as well as analysts expect stocks to settle into a steady upward trend again soon, backed by strong economic and financial fundamentals. 

   "When the dust finally settles, we expect this market to pick up considerably," says David Harman, an equities manager at Berisford Cresvale (Far East) Ltd., a British securities firm. 
Following February's solid performance, Mr. Harman says, "a normal correction of some size could have been expected and, in fact, was overdue." 

   The correction was exacerbated by its timing, coming just as major companies were reporting last year's results. 
"People usually sell into results" in Hong Kong, Mr. Harman says. 

   Earnings for major companies listed on the colony's stock exchange so far are up at least 30% on average, in line with local expectations. 
But news that several big groups were planning reorganizations and rights issues spurred profit-taking. 

   Among the companies seeking to raise money through such issues are Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp., Jardine Matheson Strategic Holdings Ltd., Hongkong Land Co. and New World Hotels Ltd. 
The total cost of those proposed issues to shareholders will be about the equivalent of $897.3 million. 

   Rights issues contributed to the market's recent slump by forcing local investors to skim profits from their portfolios to finance their portions of the issues, says Stuart Cook, a director of research at the Hong Kong office of James Capel &amp; Co., a British securities firm owned by Hongkong Bank. 
"Very soon now, the issues should be well and truly discounted in the market," Mr. Cook says. 

   Local investors, who have been pushing the market lower, often are quicker to adjust their positions than foreign investors, he says. 
Many of market's foreign participants started investing only in the past several years -- and since August in particular, when Tokyo's stock market faltered. 
So they aren't accustomed to the rapid pace of share turnover practiced by many local institutions. 

   "This is one of the world's busiest markets," a broker says, noting that the average daily turnover has increased about sevenfold from a year ago. 
If Hong Kong's average daily turnover of $182 million persists, in a year the equivalent of nearly three-quarters of the exchange's total capitalization of around $60.24 billion will change hands. 

   Still, even though locals generally trade their portfolios more frequently, much of that liquidity derives from the recent foreign investment. 
And because foreign institutions have been buying heavily, most were unwilling to take on additional shares to prop up the market when local selling knocked it lower this month. 
Nor would the foreign houses sell -- and take losses -- at the market's lower levels, so volume has declined even as the market's volatility has increased. 

   The market should emerge from its current volatility soon and head higher, analysts say, noting that the economic fundamentals backing the market are among the strongest in Asia. 

   "Hong Kong is the only market in Asia with rapidly improving fundamentals," says John C. Quinn, a director of Chase Manhattan Trust Co.'s Hong Kong office. 
"We don't see any big downside risk here." 

   A chief factor supporting the market is Hong Kong's strong, export-driven economy, which should grow at least 6% this year, after swelling around 9% last year, the colony's government says. 
The stability of the local currency, which is officially linked to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 7.8 Hong Kong dollars to one, and relatively low interest rates, which have bolstered local property prices considerably in the past year, are chief factors as well. 

   "Fundamentally, Hong Kong is one of the strongest markets in the world," says Caspar Li, an assistant director of research at Vickers da Costa &amp; Co., a brokerage owned by Citicorp. 

   Mr. Li, though, cautions that unexpected political news always poses a threat to the stock market in the British territory, which will revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. 
When Chinese Communist party leader Hu Yaobang was removed abruptly from his post in January amid student demonstrations in China, Hong Kong's stock market shuddered noticeably, dropping more than 3% in one day.

   London, Tokyo Stocks
   London shares advanced to a record close Friday in moderate trading. 
The 100-share index rose 26.5 points to 2017.5, eclipsing Wednesday's high of 2006.6. 
The Financial Times industrial-share index rose 17.3 to 1598.9. 

   Investors ended a two-day respite that followed Tuesday's unveiling of the British budget. 
They expect retail issues to benefit from the budget's personal-tax cuts and the drop in British banks' lending rates, a trader said. 
And the benefits of lower mortgage costs, resulting from falling interest rates, a drop in money supply and stable inflation, will be "larger than the gains" from tax cuts, the trader said. 

   Foreign demand, Wall Street's performance Thursday and buying ahead of the new trading quarter, which starts today, helped as well, traders said. 

   The gold mines rose 12 points to 362.4. 

   Meanwhile, Tokyo's Nikkei stock average, which fell 60.74 points Thursday, rose 13.35 to 21,657.67 in heavy trading Friday on a late rally in heavy industrial and mining issues. 

   The stock exchange index rose 2.39 to 1860.70. 
Volume was about 1.5 billion shares, up from 1.4 billion Thursday. 

   The Tokyo exchange was closed Saturday as part of its regular holiday schedule. 

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. 
To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. 
The percentage change is since year-end.

   Charles T. Russell used to play trombone in Pittsburgh burlesque houses and with big bands in the Southeast. 
He gave it up for banking, but he still knows how to attract a crowd. 

   Mr. Russell, the president of Visa International, a bank-owned credit-card association, recently urged members to consider halting sales of American Express Co. services in retaliation for the financial-service giant's recent decision to begin offering a new cut-rate credit card. 

   Consumer groups denounced the plea as an illegal restraint of trade, and Congress is considering an inquiry. 
But Mr. Russell is resolute. 
"Banks need to realize that there is a fox in the henhouse," he declares. 
Visa and the 56-year-old Mr. Russell, who enjoys riding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, have collided with consumers and Congress before. 
Critics have long alleged that Visa member banks and other card issuers inflate interest rates. 
As in past years, Congress is currently considering imposing rate ceilings, and some consumer groups think such a law would be an appropriate response to Mr. Russell's recent harangue. 

   But the push in Congress has fallen short in the past, with Mr. Russell's plain talk helping to lead the opposition. 
"He is more vociferous, but his statements probably reflect the general thought of the leading card issuers," says Pete Hart, a First Interstate Bancorp executive vice president. 

   Forewarned, First Interstate, which offers American Express Gold cards and travelers checks, is "reevaluating our relationship" with American Express, according to Mr. Hart. 
Nothing rash is planned, he says, but the new card -- Optima -- is "without question an intrusion into our business." 

   American Express and the banks are used to being allies rather than adversaries. 
American Express cards generally don't offer revolving credit, and banks have marketed them alongside their Visa and MasterCard cards, which do. 

   But Optima will compete head-on. 
The card will cost $15 a year, in addition to the $45 that American Express charges for its regular card. 
But it will extend 13.5% credit. 
The average Visa card also carries a $15 annual fee, but it has a stiffer 17.5% rate, and several big banks charge even more. 

   American Express says only a limited number of existing customers will be offered the new card. 
It doesn't expect to issue many more than two million of them by 1990, compared with about 100 million current Visa card holders. 
It doesn't know what the fuss is all about. 

   "We are not basically in the credit business," says an American Express spokesman. 
"We're going after a select market." 

   But the elite group that American Express is targeting has been a major source of bank credit card earnings. 
Banks also believe that the American Express estimates are too modest, and some fear a plastic rate war. 

   "They aren't going to fail," says Mr. Russell. 
"I don't admire their ethics, but I certainly respect their knowledge." 
He thinks American Express is misleading consumers, arguing that the Optima rate is closer to 18% when the tie-in with the regular card is considered. 

   The flap comes at a time when Visa and its members have few other reasons to complain. 
There are 22% more Visa card holders world-wide than there were two years ago. 
The group, which furnishes members with new products, system support and other services, is developing computerized cards and new links with automated teller machines. 
For the banks, credit cards have been a growing source of profits, although tax changes and a growing consumer debt load portend possibly slower future growth. 

   In orchestrating Visa's expansion, Mr. Russell has hit a few wrong notes with bankers and competitors. 
Two years ago, he led the opposition against a merger proposal from rival MasterCard, an idea that some bank issuers of both cards thought would cut costs for them and consumers. 

   Mr. Russell says that the benefits were overrated and that a merger raises possible antitrust problems. 
Instead, he has backed joint efforts, but some question his interest in cooperating. 
Visa and MasterCard have been studying a national network to process retail store debit card transactions. 
Last fall, however, Visa agreed to manage a large similar operation in California, and some MasterCard officials worried that the joint venture had been doomed. 
Mr. Russell denies this. 

   His comments about American Express also have some precedent. 
Last summer, as part of a campaign to blunt another budding competitor, Visa encouraged members to refuse to honor Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.'s Discover card in their automated teller machines. 

   Along the way, critics believe consumers have been cheated. 
Card rates haven't fallen nearly as sharply as other interest rates since 1980. 
Current rates also reflect a jump in write-offs of bad credit card loans, which some banks have brought upon themselves through aggressive marketing. 

   Mr. Russell argues that usury laws depressed rates below market levels years ago, making current rates seem high. 
He also says critics ignore administrative costs in their rate attacks. 
The steeper write-offs, he contends, stem more from "lax" bankruptcy laws and heavy unemployment in the major oil-producing states than indiscriminate card marketing. 

   While Mr. Russell faces possible congressional and Justice Department investigations into his American Express comments, he says Visa welcomes the attention. 
"We've nothing to hide, never had," adds the executive, who joined Visa in 1971. 

   Like scores of musicians, he put down his horn when television arrived in the 1950s. 
While hunting for a music-store job one day in 1953, a rainstorm forced him to take cover at a branch of what is now PNC Financial Corp. 
The bank hired him as a collector in its installment loan department. 
He married a former Pittsburgh radio singer who he used to back up in the band. 

   Weather permitting, Mr. Russell commutes every day from his Novato, Calif., home in his single-engine airplane. 
The 20-minute flight helps him forget his troubles. 
"You can't think about anything else when you're flying," he says. 
"When I fly home, I don't have a problem anymore."

   Pan Am Corp. reported a $197.5 million fourth-quarter loss, worse than it had predicted, and said it expects to post a deficit in the first quarter. 

   The fourth-quarter loss included $65 million of charges, mainly because of certain start-up costs of the Pan Am Shuttle, which began hourly service in the Northeast corridor last October; expenses related to the termination of leases of eight Boeing 747-100 aircraft; and expenses related to Pan Am's sale of its Pacific division to UAL Inc., parent of United Airlines, in 1985. 

   In the 1985 fourth quarter, Pan Am had net income of $241.4 million, or $1.79 a share, which included a $341 million gain from the Pacific division sale. 
Without that gain, Pan Am would have reported a 1985 fourth-quarter loss of about $100 million. 

   In the 1986 fourth quarter, revenue declined 12%, to $797.3 million from $906.7 million in the year-earlier quarter. 

   In mid-February, C. Edward Acker, Pan Am's chairman and chief executive officer, had said the company expected a loss of more than $400 million for 1986, indicating a fourth-quarter deficit of more than $135 million. 

   He also had said that the company would be "diligent" in writing off costs, such as residual expenses associated with the Pacific division sale. 
The airline blamed the year's losses on recent weak airline travel in Atlantic markets caused by the American public's concern over terrorism abroad and the Chernobyl nuclear accident. 

   The airline said that it would report a loss for the first quarter but that it would be "substantially less" than the $118.4 million deficit it posted in the first quarter of 1986. 

   For all of 1986, Pan Am reported a loss of $462.8 million, compared with 1985 net income of $51.8 million, or 45 cents a share. 
Revenue declined 13% to $3.04 billion from $3.47 billion. 
Pan Am said its full-year results were hurt by foreign currency exchange losses of $46.8 million, primarily related to Japanese yen debt, compared with $11.1 million in 1985. 

   A Pan Am spokesman said the airline is "nearing completion" of its previously announced arrangement for a new line of financing. 
Pan Am said it has received a proposal from Citicorp Investment Bank for a $150 million credit line that will include a syndicate of other financial sources. 
He said Pan Am currently has "in excess of $150 million" in cash. 

   Pan Am said that based on advance reservations, second-quarter traffic should be "vastly improved" from a year earlier. 

   Mr. Acker previously said Pan Am would take major steps to become profitable in 1987, contingent on obtaining major reductions in labor costs. 
Pan Am recently said it will slash its operating expenses as much as $275 million, including cutting 464 management positions, freezing management salaries and reducing other expenses under management's control. 
Pam Am has asked its five major labor unions to help cut labor costs 20%, or an additional $180 million a year. 

   In seeking concessions from its unions, Pan Am has said the airline might sell the shuttle operation to help return to profitability. 

   Even with these measures, Pan Am still faces a number of obstacles as it seeks to control costs and find ways to repay massive debt tied to aircraft purchases. 
At the end of 1986, long-term debt totaled $830 million. 

   Although the airline generally isn't considered a likely merger candidate, AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, has looked at Pan Am but recently said it wouldn't buy the company or the shuttle service. 
Pan Am has refused to sell AMR its valuable North Atlantic routes. 

   Pan Am's unions, meanwhile, are trying to find another merger partner for the company. 
They have made their own cost-cutting proposals, but the two sides haven't reached any agreements.

A Private Concern Still Needs a Public Profile

<TEXT>
   Huge, billion-dollar leveraged buyouts (LBOs) were a major feature on the 1986 financial landscape. 
This year, names like Viacom International Inc. and Owens-Illinois Inc. continue to steal headlines as tax-reform and takeover fears fuel LBO announcements and speculations. 

   Yet behind the headlines is the fact that well over 200 of the approximately 315 LBOs announced in 1986 were divestiture LBOs, in which overgrown conglomerates sold parts of their empires to division managers. 

   Where managers are resourceful and energetic, and believe in their capabilities as directors and owners -- rather than as employees -- LBOs have worked well. 
After the glow of pride fades from lining up the numbers and putting the deals together, what can corporate managers expect to find as the new owners of their former company stores? 

   One serious threat to success is the inability of some managers to make the transition from company men to entrepreneurs. 
Others become so absorbed with cost cutting and debt reduction that they forget to reinvest in the underlying business. 
Many managers also miss the abundant opportunities for reducing operating costs in areas where they have no technical competence, such as pensions, medical programs and insurance. 
Substantial savings can be realized in each of these areas without reducing benefits or coverage. 

   But the biggest danger in going private lies in management becoming close-mouthed. 
Many buyout groups react to freedom from quarterly earnings statements and shareholders by constructing moats around their companies. 
Building real value, whether a firm is public or private, means not only communicating company strategy to employees but talking with outsiders as well. 

   In 1979, I was a group president of Mead Corp. in charge of Virginia-based Stanley Furniture Co. Stanley was healthy but had not achieved its full potential as part of a big paper company. 
When I studied the situation I quickly realized that Mead would be better off without the $120 million contributed by furniture and fabric sales, and that Stanley would be better off without Mead's corporate structure. 
Stanley no longer fit Mead's strategy. 
It was also clear to me that furniture divisions of large corporate entities usually did not perform well. 
Therefore, Stanley's managers opted for a leveraged buyout. 

   The risks our buyout group faced seven years ago were enormous -- personally and professionally. 
None of us was wealthy. 
We all had to take out second mortgages to help finance our investments in Stanley. 
Interest rates had surged beyond 20% and business was in its worst slump since World War II. Gone were the security, perks and resources of the parent company. 
If the venture failed, the 2,000 jobs that supported the economy of Stanleytown, Va., would disappear along with our investment. 
But I was confident that a revitalized Stanley, even as a highly leveraged enterprise, could prosper. 

   As an owner I learned that we needed to do more than agree on management objectives -- we had to communicate our resolve to everyone working at Stanley. 
This came to a head during an early planning session when a production manager asked what company policy was on a particular matter. 
"I don't know," I said. 
"It's our company now; we have to create the policy." 
From that point on we set in motion an open-door communications program to get both our managers and employees thinking like spirited owners. 
This type of aggressive dialogue wasn't necessary under corporate rules where everyone knew his place, but it was an essential ingredient in our new company. 

   I made a special effort to keep our banks informed of our progress, much the way the chief executive officer of a public company gives updates to securities analysts. 
We discussed the results of marketing plans and new products with the banks and improved their feelings of confidence toward us at critical stages of our development. 
Similarly, we kept the press, customers and local officials informed of company developments. 

   When I had been a division president I rarely had time to spend with retailers, but as a manager-owner it was important for me to keep customers informed of our long-range plans. 
We also didn't forget Stanleytown. 
Civic programs, such as scholarships and recreational facilities, were maintained and, in many cases, enhanced. 
In essence, Stanley was a private company with a public profile. 

   Our dialogue with employees extended to company finances as well. 
We opened the books to all managers and they in turn began to appreciate what cash flow was all about. 
Soon, they were no longer talking about what they had to have, but about what they no longer needed. 
We also set up performance incentives that reached well down the chain of command -- incentives based on long-term profitability, not just revenue growth. 

   Companies that undergo leveraged buyouts must learn quickly to cope with their problems in order to maximize cash flow and pay off debts without compromising growth. 
Many of the executives in these newly created private companies will protest that they don't have the time or resources to waste on communicating their goals. 
But it is the obligation of management groups to talk candidly to employees and the outside world, especially during the early stages following a buyout. 
That's when the greatest opportunity exists to shape an LBO company into an entrepreneurial enterprise.

<HL> Financing Accord
For LTV Cleared

   A federal bankruptcy judge approved a complex bank-financing agreement for LTV Corp. that gives the company a new $100 million credit line. 

   Approval of the agreement between the Dallas-based aerospace, energy and steel concern and its 22-member bank group had been delayed since January. 
The amended plan, approved by Judge Burton Lifland in New York Friday, resolves certain objections by LTV's unsecured creditors and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a federal pension insurance agency that has taken over LTV's four big steel pension funds. 
Since last July, LTV has been operating under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code while it works out a plan to pay its debt. 

   One of the objections from the pension agency concerned that part of the financing agreement that repackages about $435 million of secured debt and letters of credit. 
The original language in the financing agreement sounded too much like a formal, overall reorganization plan, the pension agency had said. 
The court-approved agreement converts the $435 million of debt and letters of credit into a new revolving credit facility. 

   In approving the refinancing, Judge Lifland also signed an order in which LTV agreed to provide detailed information to creditors about many of its cash transfers. 
The creditors had urged such a provision so they could monitor the agreement's tight restrictions on how much profit LTV can funnel from its successful aerospace and defense unit to its troubled steel and energy products units. 

   LTV, in a statement, said it can use the $100 million bank line for borrowings and to cover new letters of credit. 
Loan proceeds may be used by LTV to meet the needs of its units, the company said. 

   LTV said the agreement also provides a revolving credit of about $160 million from which letters of credit can be drawn. 

   LTV said the agreement improves its liquidity by adding $100 million to its cash balances, which totaled $612 million at the end of 1986. 
Also, conversion of the $435 million in secured debt into a revolving credit facility gives LTV the flexibility to repay and reborrow the funds as needed, the company said. 

   LTV shares closed Friday at $3, up 25 cents, on volume of 2.9 million shares in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

<HL> Nonprofit Hospitals Seldom Profit the Needy

<DD> 03/23/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<IN> PHARMACEUTICALS, HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT (PHA) </IN>
<TEXT>
   Because hospitals represent the single largest expenditure in the U.S. health-care system, much of the current concern over burgeoning costs has focused on them. 
Reviews of hospital utilization and radical changes in hospital payment mechanisms have been introduced to curb expenses -- but to little avail. 
In 1986, while general inflation was only 2%, hospital expenses grew 8%. 

   These cost-control attempts so far have ignored the important fact that most American hospitals are operated as private, nonprofit corporations that have no structural reason to be efficient. 
Because they have no owners and no equity capital, nonprofits are freed from the scrutiny and interests of owners and the stock market. 
Because they are not government-run, they are freed from taxpayers' and legislators' oversight. 

   In a study of comparable for-profit and nonprofit hospital chains, I found that the nonprofits have higher costs, spend more on labor and have a lower turnover per hospital bed than their for-profit counterparts. 
Nonprofits also defer replacing their plant and equipment for longer periods, thus placing more of the burden of that replacement on the shoulders of future generations of users. 
These inefficiencies are subsidized by taxpayers' granting the nonprofits exemptions from most income, sales and, sometimes, real-estate taxes and by the ability of most nonprofit hospitals to borrow money at the cheaper interest rates of tax-exempt bonds. 

   Subsidies give nonprofit hospitals a substantial cost advantage over for-profits -- on the order of 3% to 6% of revenues. 
This enabled the nonprofits in my study to have the same prices as for-profits and still have higher costs. 
But, most important, I could find no difference between for-profit and nonprofit hospital chains in the amount of care given to patients who are uninsured or have low-paying Medicaid insurance. 

   Most of the 30 million uninsured patients in the U.S. are "dumped" on the public hospitals run by municipal, county and federal governments. 

   But as things now stand, it is not up to the for-profit hospital to provide care for the uninsured, any more than it is a supermarket's responsibility to feed the poor. 
The nonprofit hospital, on the other hand, has received a tax exemption primarily in exchange for treating those who cannot afford to pay for their health care. 
Dumping by the nonprofits is a grave violation of this social contract. 
But until we enact a system that guarantees payment for the care of uninsured patients, they will continue to be dumped on the public hospitals by the private hospitals, both for-profit and nonprofit. 

   Why do the nonprofit hospitals use their tax exemptions to subsidize higher expenses rather than to reduce prices or to provide greater services for the uninsured? 
Because nonprofit hospitals are dominated by powerful doctors, who structure them for their comfort and convenience by increasing the levels of support personnel and capital. 
For example, many nonprofit hospitals have opened extra operating rooms so that their surgeons can operate between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. and not be forced to wait for an inconvenient early-morning, late-evening or weekend time slot. 
Others have extra beds and staff so that a doctor can admit his patients at his convenience, rather than when an opening occurs. 

   I do not mean that nonprofits malevolently trade off the welfare of their physicians against the welfare of the uninsured, but rather that their physicians inevitably have a much more powerful voice in the day-to-day decisions made in running a hospital than do the poor or the society that subsidizes the nonprofit hospital. 
The for-profit hospital, in contrast, has a powerful social voice in the form of equity markets. 
If its costs are excessive, its returns will slump and more efficient competitors will enter the market. 
Also, the for-profits do not have many tax breaks to cushion them from their inefficiencies -- even the investment tax credit was lost in the last wave of tax reform. 

   Some advocates of nonprofit hospitals claim that their higher costs result in higher quality -- a claim yet to be proved. 
Others claim that only the nonprofit hospitals can generate the great medical advances from which we have all benefited. 
But most nonprofits do no research. 
It is mostly the teaching hospitals, affiliated with medical schools, that conduct research. 
They represent only 17% of U.S. hospitals, and some of them are run on a for-profit basis. 
The claimed equivalence of research superiority and the nonprofit form is also undermined by the impressive discoveries made by for-profit companies in pharmacology, biotechnology, and medical equipment and devices. 

   The American hospital sector spent $181 billion in 1986. 
If all these hospitals -- nonprofit, for-profit and government -- had paid federal income taxes at average corporate tax rates, federal revenues of between $3 billion and $6 billion would have been yielded. 
These revenues could then have been used for many purposes, such as funding those people without medical insurance. 
Most important, the huge hospital sector would likely become much more efficient by its transformation to a for-profit, tax-paying entity, subject to the intense scrutiny of its owners.

Facility to Ease
Acid-Rain Problem

   Noranda Inc. said it plans to build a $125 million (Canadian) sulfuric acid plant at its copper smelter in Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec, in an effort to clean up a major source of acid-rain pollution. 

   The plant is designed to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions at the smelter by 50%, to 276,000 metric tons annually in 1990 from 552,000 in 1980. 
The plant will use gases produced by the copper smelter to produce sulfuric acid. 

   The Canadian government and the province of Quebec will each provide one-third of the project's cost, with Noranda, a Toronto-based natural resources concern, paying the remaining one-third. 
Noranda will repay the governments with interest under certain unspecified conditions. 

   The Noranda smelter, with smelting capacity of 960,000 metric tons a year, produces 50% of Quebec's emissions that can cause acid rain, according to a government official, and the project will result in meeting more than 20% of the Canadian government's target for acid-rain emission reduction in eastern Canada. 

   Canada's environment minister, Tom McMillan, said that government aid to the project is part of Canada's "clean hands approach" in trying to prod Washington to take more action to clean up U.S. sources of sulfur-dioxide pollution. 
U.S. critics of Canada's stand have said that Canada isn't doing enough to clean its own sources of the pollution. 

   Last week, President Reagan said he will ask Congress to approve a new $2.5 billion (U.S.) five-year plan to study new approaches to cleaning up the problem. 
But environmentalists criticized the approach because it doesn't actually involve an emission-control program at U.S. power plants, factories and other pollution sources. 

   The plant at Rouyn-Noranda will produce more than 350,000 metric tons of sulfuric acid a year but because of the distance to markets, Noranda said it expects a large operating deficit from the facility. 
These costs plus Noranda's share of capital will result in the company's carrying about 70% of the financial burden attached to the facility, the company said. 

   Construction is to begin immediately, with completion expected in late 1989.

In addition to owning the Boston Globe, Affiliated also operates a small publisher and retailer of fine books and has a 45% stake in a company involved in cellular telephone and paging systems. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Affiliated's shares fell 75 cents, to $47.25. 

   Gerald Hobbs, president of New York-based Billboard, views the acquisition as a positive step for his company. 
Billboard's owners had been trying to sell the company when Affiliated approached them several weeks ago, said Mr. Hobbs. 
"The management of Billboard was anxious to ensure the continuation of the company's growth and also to facilitate future acquisition plans," he said. 
"We needed someone who would be in it for the long run." 

   Billboard currently is exploring possible acquisitions in information-based fields, such as magazine publishing and database operators; the company expects to make an acquisition before the end of the year, Mr. Hobbs said. 

   Billboard publishes eight specialty magazines, including Billboard magazine, a weekly that covers the entertainment industry, and Backstage, a news magazine for commercial film production and theatrical services. 
The company also publishes 15 annual directories, owns the book publisher Watson-Guptill and electronically distributes information world-wide. 

   Specific terms of the acquisition plan weren't disclosed, but Affiliated said Billboard will be operated as a separate subsidiary. 
Affiliated also said that under a separate agreement, certain members of Billboard's present management plan to buy as much as 10% of the equity in Billboard Publications following the acquisition. 

   Some analysts applauded Affiliated for the acquisition. 
Kevin Gruneich, a vice president at First Boston Corp., said some investors were concerned that Affiliated might spend too much money for an acquisition as it had built up a sizable cash position. 
In December, the company sold six radio stations for $65.5 million. 

   But Billboard "puts another leg on the stool," said Mr. Gruneich. 
"Affiliated is not only making a very good strategic decision by moving into specialty magazines, but they got it at a reasonable price." 

   In 1986, Affiliated had net income of $66.1 million, or $1.85 a share, on revenue of $401 million. 
Those earnings comprised profit of $39.8 million from continuing operations and $26.3 million from discontinued operations. 
Per-share earnings were adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split paid in January. 
Billboard had sales of $58 million last year and is expecting sales of $62 million in 1987, said Mr. Hobbs.

   The Transportation Department said USAir Group Inc. could acquire no more than 51% of Piedmont Aviation Inc. pending final approval of the merger by the department. 

   The decision, while allowing USAir to continue buying Piedmont stock, still is a setback for USAir. 
The airline had told the department that Piedmont had insisted, as a condition of the merger, that USAir offer to buy all Piedmont shares. 

   USAir already has begun a tender offer as part of its agreement to acquire the parent of Piedmont Airlines for $69 a share, or $1.59 billion. 

   USAir must place its Piedmont shares in a voting trust, but can instruct the trustee to vote them on the merger. 
On other issues, USAir had proposed allowing Piedmont's outside directors to decide how to vote the shares in the trust. 
But the department said that on such issues, the shares must be voted proportionately with the shares USAir doesn't own. 

   The ruling effectively denies USAir control of Piedmont until the department completes its review of the proposed merger. 

   The transportation agency, with the Justice Department's support, rejected USAir's application to acquire all of Piedmont's shares, saying the arrangement wouldn't have sufficiently shielded Piedmont from USAir influence. 

   USAir had told the Transportation Department that, under the merger agreement, USAir may be required to pay Piedmont as much as an additional $21 million if USAir isn't able to buy all the Piedmont shares. 

   But the department said that in most merger cases it has restricted purchases to 51% until the merger was approved. 
"USAir knew or should have been aware of our voting trust precedents limiting the amount of stock which could be acquired pending review of the underlying acquisition, and it assumed a risk when it agreed to the penalty," the department said. 

   A spokesman for USAir said the decision "does not change our plans at all, and we are continuing our plans to acquire Piedmont." 
In Winston-Salem, N.C., a spokesman for Piedmont declined to comment. 

   In other action, the department extended until April 6 the period for those wishing to comment on Trans World Airlines's application to create a voting trust to acquire 25% of USAir's stock. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Piedmont shares closed at $67.75, up 12.5 cents, on volume of 1.1 million shares, and USAir shares closed at $44.75, off 37.5 cents.

Are Laying Groundwork for a Merger

   New York's two largest futures exchanges, following a recent shift in leadership, are laying the groundwork for a merger, exchange officials said. 

   Members of the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Commodity Exchange in New York held private exploratory talks at an annual Futures Industry Association convention here late last week. 
And officials said a recently formed joint merger committee will be stepping up efforts to examine the issue. 
The ad hoc committee consists of four board members from each exchange. 

   The potential benefits of a merger would be enormous for both marketplaces, industry officials say. 
A combined entity would give New York more visibility in an industry dominated by Chicago, they say. 
That, in turn, would translate into far greater competitive clout than either the New York Merc or Comex now has, particularly in marketing new products, the industry officials say. 
Further, the exchanges would save money by merging and, for traders, there would be a wider array of markets in which to participate, they add. 

   Currently, the New York Merc trades energy futures, along with platinum and palladium, while the Comex trades gold, silver, copper and aluminum contracts. 

   Merger speculation was fueled in part by comments made here by William M. Bradt, the New York Merc's new chairman and a member of both exchanges. 
Mr. Bradt, in public and private discussions, said pursuing the possibility of a merger is one of the leading items on his agenda. 

   "I'll be pushing and pushing and pushing for it," Mr. Bradt said. 
Added Alan J. Brody, the recently elected chairman of Comex: "There is a groundswell" of support for a merger among Comex members. 

   Skeptics abound, however. 
The idea of a Comex-New York Merc merger isn't new; the exchanges have flirted with such a move on and off for nearly 10 years. 
And some futures industry officials and traders, while conceding a merger makes sense on paper, question whether either exchange's membership would ever agree to it. 

   "Most traders are just too independent," argued James Kurt Dew, a consultant to the Comex. 
Others contend that conflicting personalities and big egos will get in the way. 

   Nevertheless, there is a renewed sense of optimism among exchange leaders, especially at the New York Merc, where Mr. Bradt last week succeeded Michel D. Marks, chairman since 1978. 
Mr. Bradt is perceived by many as "more flexible" than Mr. Marks, said Lewis J. Horowitz, president of the New York Futures Exchange, a New York Stock Exchange subsidiary. 

   Mr. Brody, formerly Comex president and recently elected as the first full-time salaried chairman of the exchange, said that informal talks here resulted from the two exchanges' "commitment to making serious headway" toward combining. 

   The joint merger committee will initially focus on several areas, including common clearing, floor facilities and trading systems, said A. George Gero, New York Merc treasurer and a committee member. 

   Mr. Bradt, who before his election was a member of the committee, said he sees "more people willing to listen than ever before" to merger prospects. 

   After a private dinner meeting with Mr. Bradt and other New York Merc officials, Fowler C. West, commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said that with Mr. Bradt's apparent tenaciousness, "there seems to be a new initiative" in the merger area. 
Mr. West added that he didn't foresee any regulatory problems with such a move. 

   Industry officials said any combination probably would be the first step toward a merger of all five New York exchanges. 
The New York Merc, Comex, Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange and Cotton Exchange all occupy the same space at the World Trade Center, while the New York Futures Exchange is located adjacent to the Big Board a few blocks away. 
Some industry executives stressed, however, that a combination of the five would face much stiffer opposition than a merger of the New York Merc and Comex. 

   And even with a merger, the combined New York Merc-Comex still would be dwarfed by the nation's two largest exchanges, the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which together capture more than three-quarters of all U.S. futures trading volume. 

   Moreover, any merger would take time; industry executives suggested it would take more than two years to work out. 
Nevertheless, New York exchange leaders say they're striving for a combination before a planned move to a new building, which is expected to be completed by about 1990. 

   In the meantime, with the markets becoming more interrelated, there is an increased awareness of the benefit of such a move, exchange officials said. 

   And some futures executives say that newer, younger traders at the New York exchanges are not as opposed as some of the older members to breaking down exchange boundaries. 

   "It won't happen tomorrow, but it'll be sooner than expected," says Mr. Horowitz.

Highway Bill

Increase in the Speed Limit
In Some Areas Backed;
Reagan Pledges a Veto

   Congress, setting up a confrontation with President Reagan, cleared a five-year, $88 billion highway bill that includes a provision to let states raise the speed limit on interstate highways. 

   The Senate Friday voted 60-21 to allow states to increase the speed limit to 65 miles per hour, from 55 mph currently, on most rural interstate highways. 
The speed-limit provision then was folded into the overall highway bill and sent to the White House. 
President Reagan has vowed to veto the measure as too costly. 

   While proponents of the combined bill stand a good chance of being able to muster the two-thirds vote necessary to override a presidential veto, some on Capitol Hill said such an outcome wasn't assured. 
The House approved the highway spending provisions last Wednesday by an overwhelming 407-17 vote. 
But the speed-limit change squeaked through that chamber 217-206. 

   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) had said Thursday that he planned to try to get the Senate to adopt a cheaper highway bill that might be acceptable to the president and avert a veto. 
But Sen. Dole announced Friday that he decided against offering the amendment. 
Instead, he said he would propose a less-expensive highway bill -- probably the four-year, $65 billion one the Senate approved earlier this year -- after Mr. Reagan's expected veto of the more costly measure. 

   President Reagan suggested Friday that he would accept the earlier Senate version. 
"I am in full support of reasonable funding levels for these programs similar to the legislation passed by the Senate," he said in a statement put out by the White House. 
"But I am adamantly opposed to the excessive spending that is in the bill as it emerged from the conference committee." 

   The president objected mainly to the inclusion, at the House's insistence, of extra funds for more than 150 special highway projects. 
He also opposed funding levels for mass transit. 
The bill authorizes about $18 billion for mass transit and $70 billion for highway programs. 

   Mr. Reagan supports granting states the authority to raise the speed limit, but he won't be able to sign that portion of the bill separately from the spending provisions. 
The 55 mph national speed limit was set in 1974 in response to an energy crisis, but supporters say that it has saved thousands of lives since then. 
Critics say it is widely ignored and difficult to enforce. 

   Backers of the overall highway bill warned that if President Reagan's expected veto isn't overridden, Congress might be unable to act on new highway legislation for several more months. 
That could jeopardize the summer construction season and tens of thousands of jobs. 

   The highway program expired Sept. 30. 
Congress deadlocked last October over reauthorization legislation. 
State officials and highway groups say several states already are running low on highway cash, and are pressing hard for new legislation.

<HL> Philippines' Creditor Banks Accept Plan
To Be Paid Interest in the Form of Notes

   The Philippines' major creditor banks have accepted a proposal under which they may choose to receive some interest payments in the form of notes, sources close to the country's debt talks said. 

   Their acceptance establishes an important precedent for future settlements with other debtor countries. 
It also raises the accounting question of how banks will value such notes. 

   Philippine Finance Minister Jaime Ongpin and his country's main creditor banks still are working to reach agreement on other issues in rescheduling more than $13 billion of debt, including $10.3 billion of medium-term and long-term debt owed to foreign banks and $3 billion of trade financing. 
Talks on those issues will resume later this week. 

   The note proposal, which has drawn approving comments from U.S. Treasury officials, gives creditor banks the option to take payments covering the interest-rate margin on Philippine debt in so-called Philippine Investment Notes. 
These notes, denominated in U.S. dollars and not paying interest, could be exchanged for local currency for investment in the Philippines' debt-for-equity swap program. 
Banks will be offered a slightly higher interest-rate margin if they accept the notes than if they take a cash payment. 

   The Philippines has proposed that the interest-rate margin for cash payments be 5/8 percentage point over the banks' cost of funds, while the notes would have a face value equal to a one-point margin over the cost of funds. 
But the margins have yet to be resolved. 

   Other debtor countries, eager to encourage debt-for-equity swaps and to limit cash payments on their debt in foreign currencies, probably will want to take advantage of an option such as the Philippines' note proposal. 

   Meanwhile, because accounting principles haven't been established yet for the notes, banks that choose to take the notes likely will be on their own in either accepting them at par value or discounting them because they're only exchangeable into Philippine pesos, a restricted foreign currency. 

   Major U.S. accounting firms are split on how to value the notes. 
At the conservative end is Price Waterhouse, which audits major U.S. banks and would have them sharply discount the notes. 
The more liberal view, opposing such a discount, is taken by the accounting firm of Arthur Young &amp; Co., which is a consultant to investment bankers advising the Philippines. 

   A spokesman for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said: "We hope the Philippine debt talks move toward a smooth conclusion." 
But he declined to comment on the issue of the notes. 

   The Philippines and its bankers still have to resolve the question of interest-rate margins, and also have to agree who will monitor the Philippine economy once the country's present International Monetary Fund program expires in the middle of next year. 

   Talks on these issues were adjourned over the weekend to allow some bankers to attend the Inter-American Development Bank's annual meeting in Miami. 
The talks will resume later this week, with the more-optimistic negotiators expecting an agreement before the weekend.

<HL> Departure of 3 Anheuser Executives
In Inquiry Dents Beer Firm's Image

   The abrupt departure of three Anheuser-Busch Cos. executives amid allegations of improper payments has dented one of the nation's most carefully constructed corporate images. 

   Since the Budweiser Clydesdales first paraded to celebrate the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, Anheuser-Busch has cast itself as a bastion of all-American wholesomeness. 
Under August Busch III, the straight-laced chairman, president and great-grandson of the founder, the St. Louis-based company has crusaded against drunken driving and drug abuse, sponsored sports events and, as always, displayed the huge horses at parades and county fairs. 

   "It's a straight-arrow company culture," says a former Anheuser-Busch executive. 
"August Busch III doesn't accept gifts from suppliers, and employees know that." 

   Thus the recent allegations of improper dealings with a now-defunct advertising and promotional agency, Hanley Worldwide Inc., stunned employees of the tightknit brewing industry leader, and its competitors as well. 

   Joseph E. Martino, vice president, sales, of the company's beer unit; John C. Lodge, manager of national sales promotion events, and Michael A. Orloff, vice president of the beer unit's wholesale operations division, abruptly departed Anheuser-Busch two weeks ago, during an internal investigation by the company. 

   Anheuser-Busch won't comment on its investigation, except to say that it focuses on "allegations of improper conduct by certain employees and suppliers." 
At least some of the allegations came in disputed statements made more than a year ago in a bankruptcy court proceeding. 

   Nevertheless, the probe most likely will spawn new ethics rules at the big brewer, and a tightening of controls on promotional spending. 
And Anheuser-Busch's embarrassment could prompt other brewers to review practices in the high-rolling beer-promotion field, where spending will top $400 million this year. 

   Few employees better personified Anheuser-Busch's clean-cut image than the three departed executives. 
Mr. Martino and Mr. Orloff, both graduates of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, joined the company in 1979 as brand managers and soon hit the fast track. 

   After a stint as executive assistant to Dennis P. Long, the beer unit president and the No. 2 executive in the parent company, the 34-year-old Mr. Martino was seen by insiders as Mr. Long's heir apparent. 
Still single, with a girlfriend in St. Louis, he recently bought a large, Tudor-style home in a quiet St. Louis neighborhood of big lawns and long driveways. 

   Mr. Lodge, meanwhile, was sculpting a high profile for Anheuser-Busch in the fast-paced beer-promotion arena, where the company is the biggest spender by far. 
As manager of national sales promotions events, he was breaking new ground for the company by working through black promoters and minority-owned promotional agencies. 
He also was guiding Anheuser-Busch deeper into splashy concert promotions, such as last year's Superfest tour, featuring the Temptations and other black and Hispanic groups. 

   "He's as clean-cut as you can get . . . real dynamic in preppie blazers and red ties," says Lesa Ukman, editor of Special Events Reports, a Chicago-based newsletter. 
Adds a former Anheuser-Busch executive: "All three of these guys are right out of pages of a study of yuppies." 

   But the company inquiry, which began a few months ago, changed everything. 
The impetus apparently was a few minutes of murky testimony in the three-year liquidation case of Hanley Worldwide under Chapter 7 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. 
The case continues in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in St. Louis. 

   As long as a year ago, Hanley's bankruptcy trustee charged in a lawsuit filed in the court that St. Louis-based Hanley paid a car dealer $13,500 toward the 1982 purchase of a Porsche for Mr. Lodge. 
The trustee contended in a subsequent court filing that the payment was made partly to induce Mr. Lodge to funnel business to Hanley. 
Mr. Lodge's attorney says that if the agency paid for part of the cost of the car, his client wasn't aware of it. 

   The allegations against the other two executives are far more serious, and still more murky. 
A review of the official tape recording of the bankruptcy court proceeding shows that in February 1986, a former Hanley executive reluctantly repeated what he called "hearsay" about Mr. Martino and Mr. Orloff. 
The statements were made under oath in answer to questions from lawyers involved in the case. 

   The former executive, William E. Bartlett, said he was told that "fictitious invoices" for $250,000 were sent to Anheuser-Busch, and that the money was split between Hanley's owner, an associate of Hanley's owner and Mr. Martino. 
Under further questioning, he also told of "hearsay" that Mr. Orloff had received $25,000. 

   The former executive said the source of the information about both Mr. Martino and Mr. Orloff was Hanley's owner, Marvin Cotlar. 
But Mr. Cotlar's attorney, Milton P. Goldfarb, said Friday his client had made no such statements. 
And Gerald A. Rimmel, the bankruptcy trustee, has said he found no evidence that Hanley made payments to either executive. 

   Thomas M. Walsh, an attorney for both Mr. Martino and Mr. Orloff, declined to comment. 

   Whatever the case, the three executives left within two days of one another. 

   While one or more of the executives may be cleared, the investigation's ripple effects are likely to linger in the brewing industry. 
Anheuser-Busch isn't the first big brewer to hit ethical shoals in beer promotion: Last November, Miller Brewing Co., the No. 2 brewer, won a $1.9 million settlement from a now-defunct New York promotions agency. 

   Miller, a Milwaukee-based unit of Philip Morris Inc., charged in a lawsuit in federal court in Milwaukee that the agency had used money that was supposed to be paid to sponsor auto races and other events to buy racehorses and furnish lavish residences. 
"We were getting bills for things we thought the promotions agency had already paid," says Alan Easton, Miller's vice president of corporate affairs. 

   The stakes in beer promotion and advertising are rising so fast that some executives say effective controls are difficult. 
Anheuser-Busch's ad and promotional spending per six-pack has doubled since 1980, according to Beer Marketer's Insights, a West Nyack, N.Y.-based newsletter. 
The company spent roughly $207 million on promotions in 1985, according to Advertising Age. 

   And the big Midwestern brewers that dominate the industry often know little about the glitzy, fast-paced world of promotion. 
"The promotions business is one that needs to be watched carefully," says Miller's Mr. Easton. 
"Our business is beer; we don't know much about things like racing and concerts."

TV: Big Bad Businessmen
---
By Martha Bayles</HL>
<DD> 03/23/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Readers of this newspaper will remember a flurry of articles a few years ago about the negative images of businessmen on TV. 
Some were excerpted from a 1981 Media Institute study that compiled statistical evidence that TV dramas and comedies portrayed businessmen as "crooks, con men and clowns." 
Others came from Ben Stein's 1979 book, "The View From Sunset Boulevard," and argued that the ubiquitous corporate villain was one of several systematic distortions found in the medium. 

   Has there been any improvement since then? 
Not according to a new film called "Hollywood's Favorite Heavy" (airing Wednesday, 9-10 p.m. EST, on most PBS stations). 
Echoing these criticisms, narrator Eli Wallach explains: "The businessmen you see portrayed on TV seem to make an awful lot of money, without ever having to work hard or produce useful products. 
To succeed, all they seem to do is lie, steal, cheat, blackmail, even murder." 

   In addition to echoing past criticism, the film reenacts some of it. 
For example, Mr. Stein's book describes his unsuccessful efforts to pitch the idea of a TV series with a businessman hero. 
The film opens with a staged conversation between Mr. Stein and Al Burton, an executive producer at Universal Studios, in which Mr. Stein halfheartedly pitches a show about "a guy who is a venture capitalist, and the adventure each episode is starting some little company." 
Mr. Burton passes, saying that the whole thing makes him "yawn emotionally." 
Then Mr. Stein pounces, with his familiar accusation: "Do you think the problem is a businessman being the hero?" 

   The scene would be more persuasive if Mr. Stein didn't also seem to be yawning emotionally at his eight-year-old idea. 
At any rate, his eight-year-old criticism still applies to plenty of contemporary TV shows -- especially crime dramas, for the simple reason that they require a constant supply of bad guys. 
In interviews with prominent TV writers, producers and network executives, we learn two reasons why the businessman continues to be television's villain of choice. 

   First, by default. 
A writer for "The A-Team" claims that mobsters cannot be the heavies any more, because the networks don't want to be accused of stereotyping Italian Americans. 
"You can't say 'Mafia,'" he adds. 
Other interviewees, such as a creator of "Miami Vice," imply that any trace of ethnicity is a no-no: "The easiest mark is to put some white-bread character in a three-piece suit who is a white-collar criminal." 

   Second, most viewers are considered too stupid to relate to less-obvious bad guys. 
As a writer for "The Fall Guy" puts it, most writers and producers "assume that their audiences are 'lumpen proletariat' that are drooling and eating frozen dinners, not even heating them because they can't master the microwave. 
Yeah, they're just sucking them until they get warm!" 
These audiences "are going to understand if you say business is bad . . . everyone's going to say 'Yeah, right!'" 

   Even if this description fit the average TV viewer, it would still beg the question: Why are businessmen seen as such obvious stock villains? 
One explanation might be that TV people themselves dislike business. 
In his book, Mr. Stein suggests a bias on the part of Hollywood's "creative community" against the pin-striped, ratings-obsessed "suits" from the networks. 
He also hints that differences in culture, values and background might incline the crowd on Sunset Boulevard to take a dim view of America's corporate elite. 

   Unfortunately, these interesting speculations don't make it into the film. 
Instead, we are treated to the spectacle of Mr. Stein browbeating the interviewees about "ideological preferences." 
And the film starts to feel outdated when Mr. Wallach explains: "In the late '60s and early '70s, the mood of the country changed. 
The Vietnam War, environmental crises and Watergate shook the nation's faith in its institutions. 
And TV reflected this new anti-establishment perspective." 

   Right on target, for 1979 or 1981. 
But this is 1987, and TV has a new type of corporate villain: the lovable/hateable member of the family, such as J.R. on "Dallas" or Alexis on "Dynasty." 
"Hollywood's Favorite Heavy" acknowledges the existence of these new villains, and admits that they contrast strikingly with the usual crime-drama villain, who brandishes a weapon or dumps toxic chemicals just long enough to get caught by the hero. 
But it fails to do them justice. 

   In reply to the argument that popular culture has always used tycoons as heavies, the film points to melodramatic movies of the '40s and '50s, in which the wicked businessman was usually thwarted by a virtuous businessman. 
It adds that these movies accepted the basic legitimacy of the business system. 
Yet it draws no parallel between these older films and a show like "Dallas" -- which is nothing if not a melodrama, opposing the greedy, unscrupulous schemes of J.R. to the honorable practices of Bobby; and expressing reverence toward the generation of Jock Ewing for having built a fortune out of mother wit, sweat and Texas dirt. 

   Since their inception in the early '80s, the prime-time soaps have dabbled in total corruption -- Bobby, Blake, Chase and Karen have each acted reprehensibly at times. 
But soon enough, they have repented and gone back to their upright ways. 
The producers know perfectly well that without these noble characters, their whole formula would collapse. 
Without these pillars of goodness, all those satiny billows of evil would have no support. 

   "Hollywood's Favorite Heavy" ends with a couple of sequences in which ordinary viewers talk about the prime-time soaps: a group of women in a beauty parlor, and a class of high school students under interrogation by Herb London, a dean at New York University. 
The women demonstrate a keen grasp of how the soaps exaggerate wickedness for melodramatic, and sometimes comic, effect. 
The high school students, on the other hand, express admiration for the amoral behavior of J.R. and his ilk, and declare that if they were in business, they would probably act the same way. 

   The film makers, Michael Pack and Dan Polin, told me that they consider this high school sequence to be the most interesting and revealing in the film. 
Norman Lear is shown gasping with horror at it, and Messrs. 
Wallach and Stein base their final statements on it. 
Unfortunately, no former teacher like me can give any credence to a discussion in which an adult works so heavily at getting pliable young people to tell him exactly what he wants to hear. 
The film would have done far better to pick up on the nuanced, amused remarks of the beauty-parlor women -- who, after all, could be the high schoolers' mothers. 
But then it would have had to offer its own statement about why TV has returned to the business melodrama, and that would have been a lot harder than simply repeating old criticisms.

Plays, films, literary works whose appearance would have been impossible a few years ago are now on the scene. 
Andrei Sakharov returns from Gorky; many other dissidents are released from the Gulag; Mikhail Gorbachev speaks of having competition in elections to party positions; and family businesses are made legal. 

   How fundamental are the changes these events portend? 
In "The Waking Giant: Gorbachev's Russia" (Pantheon, 298 pages, $17.95), Martin Walker, the Manchester Guardian's Moscow correspondent since 1984, says that the situation is "revolutionary." 
More importantly, Mr. Gorbachev describes it that way as well. 
As Mr. Walker puts it, the situation is driven by the emergence of a new class, well-educated, relatively prosperous, influential, frustrated by the inefficiencies and dreariness of Soviet life and keenly aware of Soviet backwardness. 
This class wants to see the system reformed. 

   "Reform" is not "revolution." 
Mr. Walker's informed and sympathetic descriptions of the struggle to gain more freedom for the arts, of the emergence of a feminist movement (in a country where women have a truly hard lot), of recent economic experiments, suggest that the modification of the existing system, not its transformation, is the aim of most of those pushing for change; and there are many in the Politburo, Central Committee and Communist Party who resist even this. 

   Mr. Gorbachev may indeed want some big changes; at least he says some bold things. 
He sometimes asserts that there is a need for flexible prices linked to demand as well as cost; that farmers should be able to market their produce; and that wages should be linked to personal -- and organizational -- performance. 
But, as Mr. Walker observes, the system has little room for maneuver. 
The party and bureaucracy resist, needed price increases could result in riots, and Mr. Gorbachev might go, as did Nikita Khrushchev, in a "Putsch." 

   The economic system and its performance are of central importance, and Mr. Walker's treatment of them is inadequate. 
Soviet real national income did not grow at anything like the 62% rate during the 1970s that Mr. Walker claims; the improvements in the Brezhnev years were mostly over by the mid-1970s. 
Contrary to Mr. Walker's assertion, an arms race in space will definitely not boost the Soviet economy. 
Mr. Gorbachev is clearer on this when he complains to Ronald Reagan that the American Strategic Defense Initiative is designed to drive the Soviet Union into bankruptcy. 

   The basic cause of Soviet economic malaise is the command structure of the economy, but the Soviets are also hurt, much more than Mr. Walker acknowledges, by the enormous share of resources taken by the military and related activities throughout the Soviet empire. 
As Mr. Gorbachev tries to hold down military spending and shift resources into investment, Mr. Walker sees, plausibly, that the surface navy and the Soviet forces along the Chinese border will likely be most affected. 

   If Mr. Walker deserves good grades for his reportage of Kremlin personalities and the cultural scene, and (at best) an incomplete on economic matters, he flunks on geopolitics. 
Here his stance is nominally neutral, but it is operationally favorable to the Soviets (or rather to his notion of what Mr. Gorbachev stands for). 
His arguments are depressingly familiar: The invasion of Afghanistan is just one of those things that empires do; the "For every Afghanistan there is a Vietnam" syndrome. 
The old Soviet fear of being surrounded by enemies compels the country to break out and dominate its neighbors. 
Moreover, the West's support for corrupt and brutal regimes in the Third World is the real reason for Soviet expansion there. 

   Of course we need to try to understand the Soviet Union better, but to those on the receiving end of Soviet bullets and bombs, whether directly or indirectly delivered (no hint at Soviet support of terrorists pops up in Mr. Walker's book), it is present Soviet behavior that matters most, not the terrible past that has warped its collective psyche. 

   Mr. Walker suggests that the West has an interest in maintaining the "physical and territorial integrity of the Soviet state" and that the failure of Mr. Gorbachev's program might produce a collapse with consequent chaos -- a united Germany, a European crisis and, perhaps, general war. 

   So let us help Mr. Gorbachev, he urges. 
We have been hearing this line from West Germany's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and we will hear more of it from others in coming months. 
The problem with this line is that the Soviet system is all too stable; that is, too resistant to change. 
Help from the West simply makes it easier for its rulers to maintain their inefficient system.

<HL> For Claudine Malone, a Takeover Bid
Raised Issue of Whose Board to Serve

   Claudine B. Malone faced an unusual dilemma when she learned in mid-February that Dart Group Corp. was considering a bid for Supermarkets General Corp. 

   For eight years, the 50-year-old teacher and management consultant from McLean, Va., had served as an outside director on the boards of both companies. 
And she realized the potential for a conflict of interest. 
"It was clear that I had to resign from one or more boards," she says. 

   So, after discussing her options with a lawyer, Ms. Malone resigned Feb. 28 from the board of Dart Group and its affiliate, Trak Auto Corp., choosing to remain on the board of the company that became Dart's target. 
She is now "a full participant in our deliberations," according to a Supermarkets General spokesman. 
The Woodbridge, N.J.-based food retailer is mulling a $1.62 billion unsolicited takeover proposal that Dart made March 6, as well as alternatives that include seeking another suitor. 

   Few directors are ever thrust into Ms. Malone's position, but her decision strikes some experts as odd. 
"I would have gotten off both boards," says John M. Nash, president of the National Association of Corporate Directors. 
"She has a lot of information in her head about the acquiring company and there may be information there that may be useful to Supermarkets General in their defense. 
I think she's walking a very thin line." 

   Adds Barbara Hackman Franklin, a corporate director who heads the government and business program at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia: "It sounds like an awkward situation at best." 

   Ms. Malone, who is black and serves on the boards of several other big companies, defends her decision. 
"It didn't seem to me that what's in my head about the Hafts (the father and son who head the discount retailer) and Dart was that germane to this transaction," she says. 
"My conversations with the Supermarkets General people did not lead me to think I should resign from Supermarkets General's board as well." 

   Moreover, Robert Haft, the 34-year-old president of Landover, Md.-based Dart and a former student of Ms. Malone's, doesn't consider her a traitor. 
Instead, he seems to think of her as a potentially sympathetic ear on the Supermarkets General board. 

   He says Ms. Malone maintains "a complete wall" between her various board activities and provided no help on Dart's bid. 
But he adds that she "understands our business operations and our abilities" and "our resolve to acquire a third retailing business." 
Dart currently operates two discount retailing operations, Crown Books Corp. and the Trak Auto chain of automotive supplies stores. 

   Officials of Supermarkets General, which has indicated a strong desire to remain independent, say they never questioned her loyalty. 
"She resigned from the Dart board and she therefore has no conflict of interest," says the spokesman. 

   Ms. Malone, who teaches part-time at the University of Virginia's business school, won't say why Dart's was the seat she gave up. 
She says only that the choice was difficult: "I had longstanding, good relationships with both groups, which I valued personally and professionally." 

   Not everyone would say that about the Hafts. 
They have a reputation for putting companies into play and selling back stakes in their targets for a premium, a practice known as "greenmail." 
Last year, when Mr. Haft and his father, Herbert, made a bid for Safeway Stores Inc., the nation's largest supermarket chain, they were quickly rebuffed. 
Safeway went private, and the Hafts made a profit of about $140 million on their stake. 
Some analysts have speculated that Dart might be more interested in putting Supermarkets General into play than in buying it. 
Currently Dart owns less than a 5% stake. 

   Ms. Malone's Dart and Supermarkets General ties go back to the 1970s, when she taught at Harvard Business School. 
The elder Mr. Haft, Dart chairman, attended one of her seminars, as did Leonard Lieberman, chairman and chief executive officer of Supermarkets General. 
Robert Haft took her course while studying for his MBA. 

   When Dart was looking for an outside director in 1979, the younger Mr. Haft recommended his former professor. 
Their relationship remained warm -- Robert Haft, at Ms. Malone's invitation, spoke to one of her classes last fall -- though they haven't spoken since she left Dart's board. 

   The daughter of dress shop owners in Washington, Ms. Malone has been involved in retailing most of her life. 
Her first job was wrapping Christmas gifts for Raleigh Stores, a closely held chain of clothing stores in the Washington area. 
Later, she returned to the company as controller. 

   A certified public accountant and a Harvard-educated MBA, Ms. Malone serves mostly on the audit and finance committees of the boards she has joined. 
Last year she served on nine boards, including Limited Inc., Campbell Soup Co., Scott Paper Co. and Houghton Mifflin Co. 

   According to 1986 proxy statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ms. Malone received more than $93,000 in annual retainers for serving on the boards, plus additional fees of as much as $1,000 each time she attended a meeting. 
Supermarkets General paid her $13,000, plus $750 per board or committee meeting. 
As an outside director and member of Dart's audit committee, she earned $12,000. 
Trak Auto paid her a $10,000 fee. 

   Ms. Malone says she didn't set out to become a professional director. 
But she started joining boards at a time when many companies were trying to add women and minorities. 
"Over time," she says, "various relationships led to board opportunities."

Tax Law Tough
On Bad Debts
Within Family

   June M. Rodgers, who made a small fortune from fast-food franchises, loaned her new husband, Allen C. Smith, more than $125,000 for his business. 
He had led her to believe it was worth more than $1 million. 
She learned the truth some six months later when the vending-machine company stopped operating and put itself into bankruptcy. 

   She got a divorce -- and nothing from the bankruptcy settlement. 
So she took a bad-debt deduction on her tax return. 
But that wasn't the end of her problem: The deduction was challenged by the Internal Revenue Service, on the claim that Ms. Rodgers had actually made a gift to Mr. Smith. 
Ms. Rodgers took the matter to Tax Court, where she eventually won. 

   Others claiming such deductions don't always succeed. 
The IRS frequently challenges people who write off loans to friends, relatives or their own businesses. 
"I found it to be one of the major audit triggers on personal tax returns," says Bernie D. Goldstein, senior managing partner of Goldstein &amp; Schmerling, a Nashville, Tenn., accounting firm. 

   If the IRS challenges the deduction, then the taxpayer must prove that a bona fide debt existed, that it became uncollectible and that the write-off was taken in the year that the debt became worthless. 

   Being soft-hearted can turn a bona fide debt into a nondeductible gift. 
Deciding against suing a relative, even though he may be able to pay off the debt, means becoming unentitled to a bad-debt deduction, says Alfred B. Greenberg, a partner in Phillips Gold &amp; Co., a New York accounting firm. 
"What you have really done is made a gift," he says. 

   To take the deduction, "you need to be able to show that you made an honest effort to collect the debt," says Nancy Anderson, a senior tax-research and training specialist at H &amp; R Block Inc. in Kansas City, Mo. 
A letter from a lawyer saying that collection efforts would be fruitless, because the debtor is insolvent, usually is proof of a debt's worthlessness. 

   So is the debtor's filing a bankruptcy petition unless collateral is involved. 
Then a lender may have to await the outcome of a bankruptcy proceeding to establish that nothing can be recovered on the debt. 
If a partial recovery is made, the uncollectible amount normally is deductible. 

   The IRS requires taxpayers who take a bad-debt deduction to attach a statement to their returns listing the amount of debt, when it became due, the names of the debtors and whether they are relatives, plus what efforts were made to collect the money, and when and why the debt became worthless. 
IRS Publication 548, available free from the IRS, explains the government's position on bad-debt write-offs. 

   A frequent error that taxpayers make is taking a business bad-debt deduction for a non-business debt. 
An owner who lends money to his firm's customers to retain their business usually is considered to have business debt, because there was a business motive for the loans. 

   But an owner who lends money to his own business is generally deemed to make a non-business loan. 
The IRS sees such loans as protection for the owner's investment, not as part of the business itself -- since he isn't in the loan business. 

   It is an important distinction. 
A business bad debt is fully deductible in the year it becomes worthless. 
But a non-business bad debt is treated as a short-term capital loss, only $3,000 of which can be deducted each year. 
The excess is carried forward and $3,000 is deductible each year until the amount is exhausted. 

   A taxpayer who has to make good as the guarantor of someone else's debt isn't necessarily entitled to a bad-debt deduction. 
If the guarantee was done as a favor for family or friends, the IRS considers it a non-deductible gift. 
But an owner who makes good on loans he guaranteed for his business normally would be entitled to a non-business bad-debt deduction. 

   Mr. Goldstein contends that the co-signer of a note can take a non-business bad-debt deduction if he makes good on a note in order to maintain his own credit standing. 
"The IRS might argue that you didn't have to pay off the note," he says. 
"But I would argue that your name is on that note and you couldn't afford to have your reputation impugned at the bank." 

   Attaching to the tax return a letter from the bank demanding payment should help to sustain the deduction, he says.

   Texas Air Corp., moving to consolidate its diverse family of airlines, is facing resistance from employees on a growing number of issues, ranging from wages and work conditions to seniority. 

   The biggest trouble spot now is Eastern Airlines, where union and management have continued a war of nerves that began when the company last January requested pay cuts averaging 29%. 
Eastern executives recently met with representatives of the pilots and machinists unions and agreed to continue discussing labor-cost issues without reopening existing contracts. 

   But no concessions have been volunteered by the unions, which are taking new offensive measures. 

   Eastern pilots said they plan to put up picket lines in certain cities April 2. 
The pilots aim to protest not only Eastern's call for wage cuts, but also newly imposed sick-leave rules, which the pilots maintain are in violation of the contract, and Texas Air's transfer of certain Eastern assets, including planes and routes, to Texas Air's nonunion Continental Airlines unit. 

   The Eastern pilots have also proposed broadening the jurisdiction of their labor contract to pilots at all Texas Air units. 
Through its Continental Airlines unit, Texas Air also owns People Express, Frontier Airline and New York Air. 
Eastern executives haven't responded to the proposal, and won't comment on any meetings with union representatives except to confirm that they have occurred. 

   Eastern's pilots are also holding informal organizing meetings with Continental's nonunion pilots throughout the U.S. 
But getting Continental's pilots to join a union won't be easy; many of them crossed picket lines during an acrimonious strike at Continental in 1983. 
"We know it's going to be tough," concedes Jack Bavis, chairman of Eastern's pilots union, who is heading the effort to enlist Continental pilots in the union. 

   Eastern pilot union officials claim their efforts received a major boost last week, when Texas Air announced a possible new seniority plan for pilots. 
Under the plan, Continental captains would be senior to pilots who were captains at People Express, and all other Continental pilots would be senior to all other pilots who worked for People. 
This means that Continental pilots will have first crack at better routes and aircraft and access to more favorable layover points and trip lengths. 
Thus, Eastern union officials view the former People Express pilots as most receptive to efforts to organize the entire force of Continental pilots. 

   Texas Air's seniority plan will occur only if the corporate structure of People Express is merged with Texas Air, as the operations of People Express already have been. 
A Continental spokesman said People Express pilots are treated somewhat less favorably only because their prospects for advancement were grim before the troubled company was acquired by Texas Air. 
Still, a group of pilots already filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court over the proposed seniority plan. 

   Meanwhile, other Eastern unions are no closer to resolving labor-contract issues raised by Eastern management. 
Charles Bryan, the president of Eastern's union representing machinists and baggage handlers, termed a recent meeting with management "an exercise in futility." 
Mr. Bryan said he was particularly angry that the day after the meeting, Eastern announced it was terminating 98 mechanics' jobs. 
The timing of the layoffs, Mr. Bryan asserted, made it appear as if the job slashing had the union's tacit approval.

A Tamer Triple Witching Hour Takes
Stocks, Futures Prices to Record Highs

   The once-quarterly stock, futures and options trading frenzy that is triple witching hour came again on Friday, bringing stock and futures price records instead of a curse. 

   Perhaps tempered by experimental regulatory guidelines, it was a bit tamer than its predecessor last Dec. 19. 
And it left relieved investors daring to hope that Wall Street may finally have learned to cope with the massive program trading activity associated with the simultaneous expiration of stock-index futures, index options and options on individual stocks. 

   Or was it luck? 
Indications are that a number of big institutional investors moved to "unwind" their combined stock and futures positions well before Friday. 
Perhaps as a result, New York Stock Exchange volume during the final minute fell far short of predictions. 

   Following an unnerving swoon shortly after 3:30 p.m. EST, stock prices did run up sharply as final-minute volume totaled 55 million shares -- not much more than half of the final-minute volume Dec. 19. 
After the close, both Wall Street traders and federal regulators pronounced themselves pleased with how the trading was handled. 

   "Certainly, the level of volatility was low and things seemed to be handled smoothly," said Richard Ketchum, head of the market regulation for the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
"We still have to do an analysis of the microdynamics of the close -- who did what to whom and why," said SEC Commissioner Joseph Grundfest, but "I wouldn't call (the experimental regulation) a failure." 

   Peter Borish, vice president of Tudor Investment Corp., said that expirations are "good because they scare people. 
You can't have a bull market without people being afraid" that stocks are poised to drop sharply in price. 
He predicted that the stock market rally will accelerate "faster than anybody thinks. 
The Dow will be at 2550 in the next three weeks" before an 8% to 10% correction. 
Then the rally will continue, he said. 

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 2300 for the first time, gaining 33.95 points -- a dozen during the final minute -- to finish at a record 2333.52. 
In Chicago, the June contract on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index soared to a record high of 299.80, up 3.80 for the day. 

   "This was the first expiration I've seen where (investors) weren't sitting on their hands or acting in some unusual way because it was an expiration day," said Joseph Schmuckler, a vice president in the financial futures department at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. 
"The market is maturing and it was business as usual," he added. 

   But, while it might not mean major new regulation, business as usual will mean continued government scrutiny of program trading activity. 
Today the commission's Division of Market Regulation is scheduled to release a 43-page study of the hectic trading that drove down the Dow Jones Industrial Average a total of 120 points last Sept. 11 and 12. 

   That big sell-off wasn't triggered by stock-index futures trading strategies, the study found, but rather by investors' perceptions that economic conditions had worsened. 
However, it adds that "index-related futures trading was instrumental in the rapid transmission" of investors' bearishness to stock prices "and may have condensed the time period in which the decline occurred." 

   The study, completed with the help of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission staff, concludes that the September plunge alone doesn't suggest any major regulatory or structural changes are needed. 
But it warns that "dramatic growth" in institutional use of index products "requires continued careful analysis of the potential for disruption of the stock market as well as manipulative or other inappropriate trading in the index products and their component stocks." 

   Big Board member firms' apparently strict compliance with experimental SEC and Big Board trading regulations may have helped damp volatility in Friday's session, market professionals said. 
Under the guidelines, all the firms were to disclose a half-hour before the close all the orders in 50 blue-chip stocks, including all of the Dow Jones 30 industrials, that they planned to fill on the closing bell. (It is the crush of these "market-on-close" orders, executed precisely as the futures and options expire, that produces the triple witching hour trading mayhem.) 

   At the December expiration, not all the market-on-close orders were reported by the 3:30 p.m. deadline. 
The imbalances in the orders that were entered by them showed there were many more sales than purchases planned for the closing bell. 
But in the final minute, one firm, reportedly Salomon Brothers Inc., entered an estimated $1 billion to $1.5 billion of buy orders. 
While the big order forced prices to spurt higher at the bell, it also frightened and angered other market participants that day. 

   As it turned out Friday, the imbalances in market-on-close orders disseminated on the Big Board transactions tape were heavily on the buy side, precisely the outcome at the close. 
But it was a tortuous road to the bell. 

   Friday morning "every major house was said to have buy orders" for execution on the close. 
That was pretty common knowledge before the market opened," said Michael Bernstein, a partner with Miller, Tabak, Hirsch &amp; Co., a New York securities firm. 

   Stock prices started to rise as trading got under way Friday. 
Airline, drug, oil, technology, and some brokerage firm stocks took off. 
Trading was active throughout much of the morning but settled down a bit around midday and through much of the afternoon until the final hour. 

   In the final hour, the anxiously anticipated late buy orders began to flow. 
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. reported shortly after 3 p.m. that it had blue-chip stock buy orders totaling $1.1 billion. 

   The noise level in the trading room of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in downtown Manhattan jumped several notches at 3:30 p.m., when traders read and shouted out the already-calculated order imbalances streaming by on the Big Board transactions tape on the firm's intercom system. "100,000 shares of General Motors to buy," shouted one; "276,000 shares of Du Pont to buy. 200,000 shares of Chevron to buy," bellowed another. 

   Then, second thoughts. 
"It's not going to be up that much. 
I'm seeing a lot of brokers with sell orders," Dan Marciano, who heads the trading desk at Prudential-Bache, broadcasted to the firm's traders at 3:45 p.m. 

   "The whole market had been rallying in anticipation of big buy programs at the close," explained Courtney Smith, head of futures trading and research at Twenty-First Securities Corp. in New York. 
But once they studied the order imbalances running on the Big Board tape "people knew that wasn't the case . . . and that led to a sell-off." 

   Indeed, brokers already had found sellers to satisfy many of the buyers as the imbalances were reported. 
There weren't as many buyers as many professionals had expected, either, and in the first 20 minutes of the final half-hour, the industrial average sank nearly 10 points. 

   Three minutes before the closing bell, the "tick" indicator, which measures the net difference between the total number of stocks trading higher in price from their prior trade and the total of those trading lower than their prior sale, showed a minus 479 issues. 
But stock prices then seemed to literally turn on a dime and by the time the consolidated tape stopped running some 25 minutes later, the indicator read plus 820. 

   When the digital clock that hangs above Prudential-Bache's trading desk showed 4 p.m., one trader blew a party horn. 
Thomas Ponticelli shouted: "Look at that block tape" as blocks of more than 10,000 shares of Coca-Cola, International Business Machines, Philip Morris, Ford, Digital Equipment, and many others whizzed by at twice the usual speed. 

   Most of the fun in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's S&amp;P 500 stock-index futures pit had occurred a bit earlier in the session. 
When the expiring March contract briefly touched the 300 mark for the first time, traders cheered and tossed cards into the air. 
"It's a real high," said one. 
"It's like you're king of the hill." 

   Most of the other closely watched market barometers also moved to new highs along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average Friday. 
The S&amp;P-500 stock index finished up 4.09 at 298.17 and the New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 2.09 to 169.37. 

   Technology stocks scored big gains. 
IBM rose 1 5/8 to 148 5/8; NCR added 3 1/4 to 67 3/4; Unisys moved up 1 5/8 to 107 1/2; and Hewlett-Packard advanced 1 to 61 1/4. 

   Texas Instruments rose 3 1/4 to 175 1/2. 
Goldman Sachs recommended the stock Friday, but other Wall Street analysts were recommending semiconductor issues to their clients in the past week. 
Also, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry urged 10 Japanese semiconductor companies not to sell computer chips overseas at unfairly low prices. 

   American Express fell 1 1/2 to 77 1/4 on more than 2.1 million shares. 
The financial services concern said it received a subpoena from the SEC requesting documents pertaining to transactions in securities of its Fireman's Fund unit and American Express. 
The subpoenas related to transactions with Jefferies &amp; Co., whose chairman resigned Thursday and plans to plead guilty to two felony counts of violating securities laws. 
Jefferies moved up 1 3/4 to 12 3/4 and other brokerage stocks also gained. 

   Amax fell 7/8 to 18 1/8. 
The company filed an offering of 15.7 million shares. 

   Computer Sciences jumped 4 3/8 to 58 3/4. 
The concern said it will negotiate a contract with NASA that the company estimates is valued at $1 billion if NASA exercises all of its options. 

   Pan Am was unchanged at 4 3/8 in active trading. 
The financially strapped airline reported a fourth-quarter loss of $197.5 million after charges. 
The stock's price has been sliding since early January when it traded around 6. 

   LTV Corp. rose 1/4 to 3 on heavy volume. 
A bankruptcy judge approved the company's $100 million financing agreement, an important step in its bankruptcy reorganization.

   For months Air Atlanta Inc. has been flying practically on empty. 
The next few days may determine whether the small, closely held airline has finally run out of fuel. 

   It is negotiating to sell as much as a 25% stake to KLM Royal Dutch Air Lines for $10 million, according to sources close to the company. 
But it may be grounded by a cash shortage before Thursday, when KLM is expected to decide whether to acquire the stake. 

   The airline stayed afloat last week by selling its slot at Washington National Airport to Pan American World Airways for $2 million. 
The transaction produced $500,000 in cash, enabling the company to pay enough past-due rent and landing fees to avoid default at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, its hub. 

   Now executives of the three-year-old carrier are scrambling to obtain a bridge loan that may be needed to tide it over until Thursday. 
They met last week with representatives of its current investors in an apparently unsuccessful effort to get them to provide additional capital. 
Air Atlanta's biggest investors include Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. and CSX Corp. 

   Air Atlanta officials said the company may be able to get through the week with cash on hand. 
Officials declined to comment on the KLM negotiations. 

   The proposed transaction with KLM would include an agreement to feed Air Atlanta passengers to KLM international flights. 
Air Atlanta currently has such an agreement with Pan American, flying that carrier's international passengers to and from New York's Kennedy International Airport. 

   Daniel H. Kolber, Air Atlanta executive vice president, said the company has discussed such agreements with a number of carriers. 

   But sources said there may be a major regulatory stumbling block to any pact with KLM. 
They said the U.S. Department of Transportation hasn't been allowing the so-called "code-sharing" between international and domestic carriers that KLM may require under the proposed Air Atlanta-KLM arrangement. 
Code-sharing between airlines involves passengers being booked on connecting flights as though they were being served by one carrier. 

   Michael R. Hollis, Air Atlanta chairman, is said to be lobbying with the federal agency for a rule change. 

   The company has attracted attention since its first flight in 1984 because Mr. Hollis, a 33-year-old black entrepreneur, entered a highly visible business without government help. 

   Air Atlanta has billed itself as an airline created to serve business, attempting to carve a niche with travelers who want such frills as roomier seats, better meals and a gate-side lounge with free drinks, telephones and newspapers. 

   Considered the best-financed black-led venture ever, Air Atlanta nevertheless was undercapitalized for the current deregulated, competitive airline environment. 
Unable to produce a profit, the company has had to appeal repeatedly for bailouts from investors. 
The company currently has about $50 million of debt outstanding, but it is mostly zero coupon convertible notes which don't require interest payments, according to sources. 
The company's most pressing problem is about $2 million owed to vendors, including the Atlanta airport. 

   Current investors are balking at providing additional funds in part because they're uncomfortable with the inability of Mr. Hollis to keep a president and chief operating officer at the company, according to a former executive with one of the initial investors. 
Last month, Harry A. Kimbriel, 59-year-old former American Airlines executive, resigned as president, citing philosophical differences with Mr. Hollis, an attorney without previous airline experience. 
Investors had insisted that someone be hired to oversee day-to-day operations at the airline. 

   Mr. Kimbriel has since agreed to continue working at the airline as a consultant. 

   Despite the airline's problems, company officials say they believe Air Atlanta will get the capital needed to put it on its feet. 
"We have a good product," Mr. Kolber said. 
The airline's load factor, or percentage of seats filled, has steadily improved to 53%, he said, despite little advertising and negative publicity. 

   Air Atlanta has argued that the company can be profitable with 12 to 15 planes; it currently has seven, which are leased. 
One reason the company is negotiating with potential investors is to provide money to lease additional aircraft.

Currency Loss,
VW Chief Says

<TEXT>
   Carl Hahn, chairman of Volkswagen AG, defended the West German auto maker's integrity in the face of a multimillion-dollar foreign-exchange scandal, which occurred despite what he said were strict internal guidelines. 

   Prosecutors are investigating the alleged fraud, which was uncovered after foreign-currency contracts -- used to protect the company from currency shifts -- came due at the end of 1986. 
VW has said that the manipulation of its contracts will cost it as much as $259 million. 
The disclosures have led to the resignation of VW's chief financial officer and the removal of its foreign-exchange manager. 

   (Despite the foreign-exchange loss, the company's stock price has stabilized after an initial decline.} 

   Defending VW, Mr. Hahn said that, when he rejoined the
company in 1982, "I asked our internal auditors to draw up a
certain set of rules -- of stop-loss orders, of no open
overnight positions -- in order to avoid all types of
speculation." In a stop-loss order, a business gives a bank
an order to sell a currency when it reaches a certain level.
And if a company has an open overnight position, it is
exposed to potential foreign-exchange losses, because
commitments to buy a currency aren't balanced by commitments
to sell the currency.
   "I like to sail, so I'm sensitive to winds," said the 60-year-old Mr. Hahn. 
"We realize we are not necessarily out of the storm, but we realize also that this is not the end of Volkswagen." 

   Mr. Hahn said that the sheer volume of transactions at VW would make it hard to catch irregularities, and that auditors worked for weeks without discovering the forgeries. 
"What looks to the public like we were acting late was actually a situation in which we thought we were acting fast," the executive said. 
"It took us some time to become suspicious." 

   But he expressed optimism that the investigation would produce results. 
"The authorities should have access to types of information that cannot be destroyed," he said. 
Data banks at VW were said to have been erased, making the probe more difficult. 
"This money has never been carried out of the company in cash, but it must have been transformed at one point into cash," he said. 
"So from Frankfurt there is possibly a line of bank accounts that will shed more light on this." 

   At VW, which as of today will have made 50 million cars, Mr. Hahn said he is presiding over a successful company whose credibility in the marketplace will be bolstered by its 1986 results. 
The figures, which are to be released in April, will show "a good base and good performance" despite an earnings slowdown, he said. 

   Volkswagen's pressing projects include setting up a dealer infrastructure for selling models made by the recently acquired Spanish car maker Sociedad Espanola de Automoviles de Turismo, or SEAT; boosting output at its Brazil operations in the face of mounting economic difficulties in that country; and restoring the image of its upscale Audi in the U.S. following recalls of its 5000 series because of acceleration problems. 

   Mr. Hahn was optimistic about SEAT, which Volkswagen acquired from the Spanish government in 1986. 
"The figures {for 1986} will not be as nice as we would like them, but they will be a dramatic improvement" over 1985, he said. 
He predicted that the break-even level will be reached in 1987's second half. 
Most important, Mr. Hahn said, is securing a much-wanted niche in the lower end of the European market through SEAT. 

   He said he is concerned about VW's Brazilian business. 
Despite a traditional position of strength, that operation is in "very difficult waters" because of Brazil's monetary and fiscal squeeze, he said. 

   To combat the effects of a weakened dollar, Mr. Hahn said Volkswagen is shifting export volume to Brazil in the manufacturing sector and using Mexico as a supply base for European manufacturing. 
The company also is streamlining its U.S. operations through the closure of its Charleston, S.C., plant and the transfer of its U.S.-based sheet-metal operation to Mexico.

   On a recent morning, Thomas O'Brien bought $25 million of stock-index futures, 225,000 shares of Reebok International Ltd. -- and a bran muffin. 
Choosing the muffin was the hard part. 

   Practically everything else in Mr. O'Brien's job as chief equity trader at Wells Fargo Investment Advisors is part of a carefully guided process. 
A computer printout tells him what stocks to buy. 
A daily scratch sheet tells him when to buy and sell stock-index futures. 
"This is great," says Mr. O'Brien, as he finishes up the futures purchase. 
"You can be in and out of the market in five seconds." 

   In money management these days, much of the guesswork, and the glamour, are fading. 
Now, formulas and percentages, rather than clever hunches about investments, are what count. 
Largely behind the change are two innovations: stock-index futures markets, which enable traders to buy and sell a contract based on the general level of stock prices, and desk-top computers, which let money managers quickly size up the market according to mathematical models. 

   At the forefront of this trend toward sophisticated investing is Wells Fargo Investment Advisors. 

   WFIA's assets have leaped fivefold since 1984. 
Now managing more than $60 billion for clients, mainly big pension funds, the firm has become the biggest single investor in the stock market. 
It also is the largest stockholder in dozens of major companies; it owns, for example, more than 10 million shares of International Business Machines Corp., equal to 1.7% of the giant computer company. 

   The success of this Wells Fargo &amp; Co. investment unit is deceptively simple. 
WFIA seldom tries to choose between good and bad stocks; instead, it merely matches market benchmarks such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. 
"They just buy a large cross section of stocks for you -- and hold it," explains Edward Safran, assistant treasurer of Polaroid Corp. and a major WFIA client. 

   Yet index funds such as WFIA's have out-performed 60% to 70% of conventional stock managers in recent years. 
"Too many active managers pick the wrong stocks or incur high trading costs," says Alan Emkin, a pension consultant at Wilshire Associates. 
"Index funds just keep tracking the market, and that's very appealing to clients." 

   A bull market such as the current one, of course, favors index funds because they are always fully invested. 
In contrast, conventional managers usually hold some cash reserves, which have hurt their performance recently. 
But reserves "could be a help if the market turns down," Mr. Emkin says. 
"You can't get out of a falling market if you're in an index fund." 

   At WFIA, there aren't any analysts trying to predict earnings, evaluate new products or forecast the economy. 
The firm's biggest section is its accounting department, which tracks portfolios, dividends and who owes what to whom. 
Stock selection is so automatic that WFIA's chief investment officer, 33-year-old Patricia Dunn, keeps a wind-up white robot near her desk. 
It is an impish present from a colleague, and on its chest is a label saying: "Investment Manager, Index Variety." 

   Robot investing irks some observers. 
"My biggest shareholders don't know who I am, let alone care whether we build a new mill in Alabama," complains Andrew Sigler, the chief executive officer of Champion International Corp. 
"We're just a computerized stock symbol to them." 
Other critics fret that WFIA's huge use of futures-trading strategies could someday jolt the stock market. 

   But big clients rush to WFIA's defense. 
"They're one of the best in the business," says Thomas E. Flanigan, the chief investment officer of the California State Teachers Retirement System. 
Mr. Flanigan oversees a $20 billion pension plan, which has moved more than $6 billion into the stock market the past few years. 
"Indexing is the only approach that lets you move that much money that fast, without hurting yourself," he says. 

   In fact, the value of stock-index funds nationwide has tripled since 1984 to $150 billion, according to consultants. 
That makes index funds equal to 15% of institutional equity holdings, or about 7% of the entire stock market. 

   More generally, highly mathematical techniques are becoming crucial to big money managers such as Bankers Trust Co., Chase Manhattan Corp. and J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. 
Once in place, their computerized models can pick stocks for years, affected only indirectly by human judgment. 
Investing is changing from an art to "a technology-driven, low-cost business," says John Casey, a pension consultant. 

   At WFIA, running the formula last Jan. 30 meant buying more than 200,000 shares of Reebok -- quickly. 
That's because WFIA likes to own all the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index, in amounts scaled to their market weight. 
Those holdings range from more than $1.4 billion of IBM to just $673,000 of Allis-Chalmers Corp. 

   But Reebok was added to the S&amp;P index only in early January, and WFIA's main index fund needed to buy about $15 million of stock in the shoe company as fast as it could without driving up the price. 
Big brokers were glad to help. 
Mr. O'Brien snapped up 100,000 shares in one lot, 125,000 in another. 
By 10 a.m., he was done. 

   For all that buying, no one at WFIA really cares how Reebok does. 
"There aren't that many mispriced securities anymore," Fred Grauer, WFIA's president, says. 
Each year, random luck brings Wells its share of winners -- and losers. 
In fact, Mr. Grauer argues that it is better to buy the whole stock market in a way that minimizes commissions and trading costs than to spend a lot of time and money in an often-futile search for "cheap stocks." 

   Last year, when the S&amp;P 500 index rose a bit more than 18%, with dividends reinvested, WFIA's big index funds were right in line-up 18.49%. 
"We can track the index to within 0.01 percentage point," Ms. Dunn boasts. 

   Index funds are just part of WFIA's business, though, and its professionals would rather talk about new products. 
These include international index funds, a fund that uses computer models to pick promising areas of the stock market, and "stock-index arbitrage." 

   This kind of arbitrage involves shuffling millions of dollars between stocks and futures, depending on which investment is cheaper at the moment. 
Last year, WFIA's stock-index arbitrage earned more than $20 million for clients. 

   Each morning, futures specialists give Mr. O'Brien, the trader, a scratch sheet with target prices for when to buy or sell futures. 
In late January, for example, he was ready to sell S&amp;P futures any time they rose more than 1.10 points above the underlying stock index. 
If futures fell more than 0.20 point below the stocks, he would buy futures and sell stocks instead. 
His typical trade involved $30 million. 

   "We did eight of these one day," Mr. O'Brien says. 
Traders joke that S&amp;P arbitrage is such a sure moneymaker that only nuclear war could disrupt it. 
In fact, Mr. O'Brien's biggest concern the morning of Jan. 30 was that too many other institutions wanted to make the same trades. 
By the time he was ready to buy futures, three other buyers had jumped ahead of him in brokers' queues. 

   Traditional money managers shudder at this form of trading. 
"This is turning the New York Stock Exchange into a commodities crapshoot," complains Charles Allmon, the publisher of the Growth Stock Outlook newsletter. 
"It's adding volatility and instability to the market." 

   But S&amp;P arbitrage "simply provides liquidity," insists Jeremy Evnine, a WFIA futures specialist. 
When other traders push futures prices out of line, WFIA steps in to restore the balance, he says. 
"To blame us for moving the market is like blaming a leash for tugging a dog. 
You have to look for the hand at the other end." 

   WFIA is even more active in another computer-driven investment strategy: portfolio insurance. 
This technique involves owning stocks while hedging the risk of a market drop with stock-index futures. 
The hedge is adjusted to increase protection in falling markets, while letting investors participate in a bull market. 

   WFIA invests now $9 billion this way, all from Nancy Feldkircher's terminal. 
The 26-year-old assistant vice president says: "I try to think of all that money as just commas and zeros. 
Otherwise, I get nervous." 

   But Ms. Feldkircher doesn't really make the decisions; she just carries them out. 
Computer software licensed from Leland O'Brien Rubinstein Associates Inc., of Los Angeles, decides when to buy and sell. 
Ms. Feldkircher's biggest modification was to put an old Mercedes instrument gauge above her terminal. 
"It makes it look more high-tech," she jokes. 

   Portfolio-insurance clients seem pleased with WFIA's results so far. 
"It's being played just the way I would have expected," says Timothy R. Barron, a Virginia investment official. 

   Nonetheless, some critics worry that portfolio insurance, with its mechanical buying and selling of futures, could someday accelerate a plunge in stock prices. 
When portfolio insurers rush to sell stock-index futures, their huge sales can depress futures prices relative to stocks. 
At that point, arbitragers, trying to profit from discrepancies between the two markets, begin buying futures while selling the underlying stocks. 
These "sell programs," often involving hundreds of different issues, can push stock prices even lower and set off a vicious circle. 

   The real test will come in a falling market, of course, and lately the market has been strong. 
However, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 86.61 points last Sept. 11, some arbitragers said they increased their selling that afternoon to get in ahead of portfolio insurers; they expected the insurers to need to sell more futures soon to implement their hedges. 

   Aware that such tactics could aggravate market plunges, WFIA is trying to use "a little bit of judgment on portfolio-insurance trading," says Rolf Theisen, another WFIA futures specialist. 
Stock options and cash markets are being used as well as futures, he explains, and traders have discretion to execute an order gradually if futures seem badly mispriced relative to stocks. 
"It isn't an emergency situation where people have to trade at all costs," he says. 

   WFIA's current market clout would have seemed unthinkable in the 1960s, when the notion of index funds arose. 
At that time, finance professors at the University of Chicago argued that individual stock prices moved so randomly that it made more sense to hold a diverse basket of stocks than to try to pick winners. 
In 1971, pension managers at Samsonite Corp. became convinced enough to ask Wells to set up the first working index fund. 

   Growth in such investing was slow in the 1970s. 
But it has taken off in the past few years, as studies going back as much as two decades began showing a clear performance edge for index funds. 
Previously stubborn pension managers decided that they might as well settle for indexing. 

   In a critical move in 1983, Wells Fargo hired Mr. Grauer away from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to run its investment unit. 
He replaced William Fouse, a pioneer in indexing, who left Wells to set up his own indexing firm for Mellon Bank Corp. 
At that point, says Mr. Casey, the consultant, "The top management at Wells Fargo finally realized what a good business they had in indexing. 
That's when they really decided to let it grow." 

   For all its huge portfolios, WFIA itself is surprisingly puny. 
It employs just 110 people, ensconced on one floor of a San Francisco office tower. 
Its index-fund management fees are minuscule, ranging as low as 0.05% of assets annually; thus, WFIA's $60 billion of assets probably provides only $30 million to $50 million a year in fee revenue. 
Its pretax profits are believed to be less than half that and thus well under 5% of Wells Fargo &amp; Co.'s overall net income. (Officials won't discuss WFIA's revenue or earnings.) 

   Still, new money keeps pouring in. 
In January, for example, WFIA added 15 more clients with $2.6 billion in assets. 

   "People keep asking us how big we can get, as if there were some upper limit," says Jeff Skelton, WFIA's director of business development. 
"They don't realize that size is the friend of the indexer."

<HL> AIDS Drug Comes to a Market Worried About Its Cost
---
Limited Supply of AZT, Access to
Treatment Pose Problems in U.S.

<TEXT>
   Now that the Food and Drug Administration has approved the first prescription drug for AIDS, concern is mounting over just how many patients can afford the treatment, and who will pay for it. 

   The federal agency gave clearance Friday to Burroughs-Wellcome Co., the U.S. unit of London-based Wellcome PLC, to market azidothymidine, or AZT, in the U.S. 
The drug is for treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and its related pneumonia, as well as for severe AIDS-related complex, known as ARC. 
More than 32,000 Americans have been diagnosed with the disease, and 10 times that number are believed to suffer from ARC, a set of symptoms similar to AIDS. 
The company estimates 15,000 patients in each category will qualify for the drug, which will be marketed under the name Retrovir. 

   Developed with an urgency that matched the swift and fatal course of the epidemic, AZT prolonged survival for patients in a six-month controlled trial last year. 
Its major side effects include severe anemia and bone marrow suppression, necessitating blood transfusions or a halt in treatment for one-third to one-half of the AIDS patients on the drug. 

   Still, "AZT is a first step that shows how rapidly progress can be made when the government and private sector work together," says Samuel Broder of the National Cancer Institute, who administered the first test dose to AIDS patient Joseph Rafuse just 20 months ago. 
This makes AZT the fastest drug development story since anti-malarial agents were sped to GIs in World War II, he says. 

   The drug's price -- $8,300 a year wholesale and $10,000 retail -- indicates a hefty $250 million in annual revenue for the company, based on treatment of 30,000 patients. 
Michael Sorell, an analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., says he expects the drug will be "a big profit maker for Wellcome," and the market reacted favorably. 
In London trading Friday, Wellcome shares closed at the equivalent of $7.97, up 62 cents. 
But the price and revenue figures alarm physicians and consumer advocates around the country. 

   "It's expensive. 
For patients, it's a potential hardship," says Lawrence Kaplan, medical director of the AIDS clinic at San Francisco General Hospital. 
Unanswered questions about insurance and Medicaid coverage further cloud the picture, because "many patients aren't working, and survive on government subsidy," explains a spokeswoman for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. 

   "Only the privileged and rich will be able to handle the cost," adds Lionel Resnick, of the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami. 
"It doesn't take much to realize that we have a very big problem." 

   "I think the extraordinarily high price of the drug needs to be justified by the company in very clear terms, because it will clearly limit access to patients who could benefit," says Jerome Groopman of New England Deaconess Hospital in Boston. 

   But David Barry, vice president for research at Burroughs-Wellcome, says: "I think it's a fair price. 
It's a price we had to charge to stay in business." 
The company, based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., has committed a total of $80 million in research and development of the drug, including about $10 million in free drug given to nearly 5,000 patients who participated in the clinical trial. 

   He reiterates that AZT is expensive to make, requiring seven months of work to produce six chemical reactions that result in the drug. 
The material, thymidine, was once obtained from herring sperm but is now purchased in synthesized form from New York-based Pfizer Corp. 

   Dr. Barry also argues that because AZT prolongs life and reduces episodes of infection, AIDS patients will require less hospitalization and will be able to return to work. 
Thus, Burroughs-Wellcome officials figure a potential 25% reduction in the cost of care for patients on AZT, he says. 

   "I have no compunction about charging this price," Dr. Barry says. 
"No one flinches at hundreds of dollars a day in hospital costs, but everyone expects a drug that prevents hospitalization to be much less." 

   But AZT's price places it clearly beyond the reach of the many patients who are indigent or uninsured. 
About 40% of AIDS patients are on Medicaid or will be, according to the federal Health Care Financing Administration. 
But not all states pay for prescription drugs under Medicaid; it is their option to offer the benefit. 
Two states, Alaska and Wyoming, offer no coverage for prescription drugs under Medicaid, and Florida, which has the fourth-highest incidence of AIDS, limits prescription drug benefits to $22 a month, according to a staffer of a congressional health committee. 

   "It makes for a very ugly situation," says Dr. Resnick in Miami. 
"I'm very frustrated. 
The government has to take a lead role. 
We have a lot of poor patients, and I would like to see them on the drug." 

   Moreover, ARC patients have a tougher time qualifying than those with a formal AIDS diagnosis. 
In California, for example, patients with an AIDS diagnosis receive Medicaid. 
But San Francisco General's Dr. Kaplan worries: "It's more difficult for patients with ARC. 
Some aren't eligible for MediCal (California's Medicaid) at this stage." 
He adds that "the issue of whether third-party payers or MediCal will be covering (treatment) remains to be resolved. 
We expect that they will." 

   One physician, who asked not to be named, warns: "Either it'll be on the taxpayer's back, or patients will be robbing pharmacies . . . . 
These are desperate, dying patients." 
Some physicians fear illegal trade in the drug will arise. 

   But federal health officials are anxiously studying the drug's impact on federal health programs. 
William L. Roper, the financing agency's administrator, estimates Medicaid may spend $50 million on AZT in 1987, and $150 million in 1988. 

   Burroughs-Wellcome executives recently faced questions on Capitol Hill that ranged from sharp to hostile, when the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment held hearings on the cost of AZT. Rep. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) asked: "How did you arrive at a price of $10,000? 
Why didn't you set it at $100,000?" 
T.E. Haigler Jr., Burroughs-Wellcome president, testified that the company's involvement in AZT research "involved a significant amount of risk." 
He added, "Because the full usefulness of AZT and the efficacy and speed of introduction of competitive products are unknown, our financial returns are uncertain." 

   Indeed, some physicians and patient advocates hope competition will come soon to force a moderation of AZT's steep price. 
Other drugs currently are being tested, including interferon, ribavirin, AL-721, isoprinosine, Imreg-1 and GM-CSF. 

   Some think competition may come from Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., recently designated the government's licensee for the development, testing and possible marketing of DDC, or dideoxycytidine. 
Hoffmann is the U.S. unit of F. Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co., Switzerland. 
The drug is a sister drug of AZT that scientists at the National Institutes of Health have found more potent in the test tube at lower doses, thus prompting hopes that the drug might work with fewer side effects. 
But only a handful of patients have received DDC, and despite a preliminary observation that it raised the count of their T-cells -- immune system cells normally ravaged by the virus -- clinical efficacy remains to be proven in larger trials. 

   The National Cancer Institute also is working on a third related compound, dideoxyadenosine, but hasn't named a commercial licensee. 
"In the foreseeable future, it's likely we'll have a number of possible strategies for the treatment of AIDS," says NCI's Dr. Broder. 
"So at some point, competition may be a real factor in reducing overall costs of anti-viral therapy." 

   But for now, AZT's availability is going to be the chief concern for many patients. 
Burroughs-Wellcome's Dr. Barry says the company has only enough to provide for 15,000 initially, but expects to supply doses for 30,000 by year's end. 

   Further, distribution will be tightly allocated under a company program that requires doctors to obtain a form from Burroughs-Wellcome -- by calling 1-800-843-9388 -- and fill out a description of an eligible patient's symptoms. 
The company then will assign a confidential patient number, and allocate a month's dose to the patient's local pharmacy. 

   Dr. Groopman in Boston says he is skeptical that pharmaceutical representatives can effectively control retail distribution. 
Dr. Barry counters that the program "is actually very streamlined and straightforward." 
But he acknowledges, "There's always the possibility of fraud." 

   AZT -- by now a textbook case on the serendipity and complexity of drug development -- was created in 1964 by Jerome Horwitz of the Michigan Cancer Foundation as a possible chemotherapy drug. 
But it didn't work and was shelved for a decade until acquired by Burroughs-Wellcome as a possible anti-microbial agent. 
When NCI began mass-screening drugs against the AIDS virus in the test tube, Burroughs-Wellcome became one of about 50 companies and private labs to send in candidate products. 
A sample of AZT was sent to NCI under the code name "compound S," and in February 1985, scientists identified it as a potent virus killer in the test tube. 

   Even before the controversy over AZT's cost, its development and testing as an AIDS drug was marked by urgency, intermittent raw-materials shortages and bitter public debate over the second phase of the clinical trial, in which some patients were merely given a sugar-pill placebo. 
Patient advocates decried the practice, while researchers maintained it was necessary to establish objective proof of the drug's effectiveness. 

   By midsummer 1986, word leaked that patients on AZT were enjoying longer survival than patients in the control group. 
An independent monitoring board in September publicly confirmed the striking six-month results: Only one of 145 patients receiving the drug had died, while 19 of 137 patients receiving the placebo had died. 
The research group then decided to end the controlled experiment, and provided the drug to the placebo group. 
Since then, 10 other patients in the original AZT group and 16 in the placebo group have died. 

   The side effects, however, require that doctors "treat this drug with respect," Dr. Broder cautions. 
Despite the brevity of the clinical trial and concern about side effects, an advisory panel to the FDA met last January and, spurred by the rapid and fatal course of the AIDS epidemic, voted 10-1 to recommend AZT receive full agency approval. 
Since then, both Britain and France have granted market clearance to the drug. 

   Notwithstanding its approval, AZT must now submit to continuing tests in groups not covered by the FDA approval: children under 12 with AIDS; patients with Kaposi's Sarcoma, which is an AIDS-linked malignancy; those with AIDS-related neurological disease, and carriers of the virus who show no symptoms. 
Also planned are studies of its effects in combination with other drugs such as the herpes drug acyclovir, or the immune-system booster interferon. 
Finally, Burroughs-Wellcome says it plans to fund a clinical trial in Africa, which is where AIDS is believed to have originated.

   If West Virginians want to hear two different views of how the nation got into its trade mess and how to get out of it, they need only listen to their two Democratic U.S. senators. 

   "It isn't the fault of the Koreans if our kids watch 'Miami Vice' instead of studying math," Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV tells a Chamber of Commerce audience in this small Ohio River community. 
"We're part of our own problem. 
American industry can't just keep running to government for relief." 

   But over in nearby Morgantown, Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd puts the blame -- as well as the responsibility for protecting basic domestic industries -- squarely on the government. 
"By the failure of our government to come to grips with the trade issue, we've lost thousands of jobs," he declares. 

   These differences underscore the complexity of the trade issue, which has recently emerged from relative obscurity to become one of the major themes of politics in the 1980s and possibly a principal issue in the 1988 elections. 

   As Congress considers the elements of a major trade package, it must grapple with the same question facing West Virginians as they listen to their two senators: whether to seek quotas, tariffs and other forms of import limits or to adopt a more limited approach that primarily seeks to increase U.S. competitiveness and exports. 

   Majority Leader Byrd takes a hard-line view, calling for quick action by Congress to protect import-battered industries like steel, textiles and shoes. 
Mr. Rockefeller, a Harvard graduate who speaks Japanese and is an avid internationalist, calls on American business to "be smarter." 

   Volker Jung, the president of Siemens Public Switching Systems Inc., a unit of Siemens AG, recently met with each lawmaker on trade issues. 
Sen. Rockefeller, he recalls, immediately began asking detailed questions about the differences between the U.S. and West German educational systems; Sen. Byrd focused on the loss of American jobs and "wanted to know what are Siemens's goals in the U.S." 

   Adds Gary White, the president of the West Virginia Coal Association: "Rockefeller tells us to make sacrifices to make our coal exports more competitive. . . . 
Byrd says he wants to protect basic industries and see that they keep their fair share of the domestic market." 

   The trade issue is crucial to West Virginians -- but it cuts in several directions. 
The state's major industry, mining, has been severely depressed for years; in steel, petrochemicals and glass, job losses to foreign competition have been high. 
But surprisingly, some 20% of what West Virginia produces is sold abroad -- far more than the 12% or so in the nation as a whole. 

   Both of West Virginia's senators are integrally involved in the congressional debate on trade. 
As the majority leader explains it, Sen. Rockefeller, who was just appointed to the Finance Committee, "is in a good position from inside to help mold the legislation. 
I'm the catalyst to put it all together." 
Moreover, both agree that trade legislation is necessary, and they articulate the same general goals for their state; for example, both believe that the biggest hope for the state's future lies in high technology. 
"We probably do bring somewhat different perspectives to the trade issue, but our goal is the same -- to make this country more competitive and to strengthen the economy of West Virginia," Sen. Byrd says. 

   When talk turns specific, the dissimilarities in their backgrounds, viewpoints and solutions begin to emerge. 
"We've had different experiences," says Sen. Rockefeller. 
"The different experiences mean we talk about trade in a different way." 

   Mr. Byrd, 69 years old, is a product of rural West Virginia. 
Raised by relatives after his mother died, he worked for 12 years to save enough money to go to college. 
His position as leader of the Senate's Democrats has made him a national figure, but he still identifies with the state's rural, largely unsophisticated populace. 
In depressed West Virginia, a job is a precious commodity, and the notion that trade is depriving people of jobs powerfully shapes Mr. Byrd's attitudes. 

   On a midweek visit to the state, the majority leader stops for coffee in Flatwoods, a town of 400 people along Interstate 79, smack in the middle of the state. 
The owner of the local truck stop tells Mr. Byrd about a nearby mill that has lost its market for barrel staves and blames the loss on unfair trading practices by foreign countries. 
In response, the senator talks about the need for tough trade legislation to "make the country competitive again." 

   The next day, Mr. Byrd is the host at a well-attended conference promoting the development of a "Software Valley" in the state to be modeled after California's Silicon Valley. 
The majority leader is trying to persuade computer giants to set up shop in the state or contribute technology to help basic industries in West Virginia modernize and become more competitive. 

   By the end of the daylong event, the senator has obtained commitments from several companies to help in the project. 
Bell Atlantic Corp. decides to locate its new software-development center in West Virginia, and International Business Machines Corp. agrees to lend an executive to run the project. 

   Sen. Byrd's push for a Software Valley is consistent with his tendency to worry first about how domestic companies are surviving and then look for solutions from the U.S. government and the business community. 
Sen. Rockefeller, on the other hand, promptly starts out looking to other countries' practices and industries for models of what to do to improve the trade picture here. 

   A scion of one of the wealthiest families in the country, the 49-year-old Mr. Rockefeller has traveled the world extensively and lived for three years in Japan. 
He first moved to West Virginia as an anti-poverty worker, then decided to stay and start a political career, eventually serving two terms as governor. 

   Not surprisingly, Sen. Rockefeller has often looked to Japan for solutions to West Virginia's economic problems. 
He was instrumental in bringing Japan's sixth-largest steelmaker, Nisshin Steel Co., to the state; Nisshin is just breaking ground on a $65 million plant, a joint venture with the beleaguered Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. that will bring at least 100 jobs. 
At a lunch kicking off the joint venture, the senator gives a Japanese official a U.S. flag that once flew over the Capitol. 
To cheers, he has the Japanese executive hold up the flag with him. 

   "Most of us have an upbeat feeling about" the joint venture, says Elaine McAlpine, the craft director of the Brooke County Senior Citizen Center, who has a colorful, oversized Japanese calendar tacked up behind her desk. 
"It's a chance to get some improvement here." 

   Even some workers who believe that they have been harmed by foreign companies look to the companies for help. 
Robert McMakin, a coal worker who was laid off in 1983, brings his resume to Sen. Rockefeller at a town meeting in the Fairmont public library, hoping to learn of potential jobs. 
"I'm willing to work for a foreign company," says the father of two. 
"I have a feeling the foreign companies put me out of work, and if they come into this country and pay Americans a fair wage so we can feed our families, I'm for it." 

   Other voters reflect the divisions between their two senators. 
At another town meeting at the library in McMechen, south of Wheeling, an overflow audience of steelworkers, retirees and others crowds among the bookshelves to voice its fears. 
Sentiment is strong for some form of protection against imports. 
"When you say we're in a world market, it's an unfair market that is putting our people out of work," James Bosworth tells the senator. 
"Maybe we should build a wall around ourselves." 
A woman in the audience calls out: "Let's have a Boston tea party and throw all the Japanese products in the ocean!" 

   But other voters think the issue is more complex. 
"If you become too protectionist, you cut your nose off to spite your face," says Charles Beall, the secretary-treasurer of a Wellsburg lumber company. 
"It could help steel, but it would hurt coal because they have to sell out of the country." 

   The only thing all voters seem to agree on is that something must be done. 
Wherever either senator goes in the state, he is besieged about the issue. 
"I've heard at least five times about rumors of layoffs," Sen. Rockefeller says. 
"So even if they have a job, they aren't secure." 

   Sen. Byrd takes pains to reassure voters that he will see to it that the trade picture improves. 
"I don't intend to preside over a continuation of this decline," he says. 

   Sen. Rockefeller, though, isn't reassuring at all. 
In the tiny northern river town of New Cumberland, he pays a visit to the John D. Rockefeller IV Vocational Center, where his family door knocker graces the front entrance. 
At the center, a local TV camera crew asks him for a "message" to the area's steelworkers that they will have jobs. 

   "There is no message anyone can give to guarantee survival," the senator replies. 
"There's no guarantee for anything in global competition."

   A U.S. court extended an order freezing the assets of an Israeli financier and a former Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. executive charged with a $4 million insider-trading scheme. 
But the SEC said the financier, David Sofer, has indicated he will fight the SEC over control of his overseas assets. 

   The SEC also disclosed in a memorandum filed at a court hearing Friday that its charges against Mr. Sofer and Nahum Vaskevitch, the former Merrill official, were filed March 11 in an "emergency" atmosphere because the SEC believed that Mr. Sofer was trying to move some of his allegedly illicit profits out of the U.S. to Switzerland. 

   The statement that Mr. Sofer may fight the SEC overseas, also made at the hearing, marked the first indication of any response in the case from Mr. Sofer or Mr. Vaskevitch, Merrill Lynch's former head of mergers in London. 
Both have been unreachable for comment and their lawyers have declined to discuss the case. 

   The SEC alleged that Mr. Sofer and Mr. Vaskevitch reaped more than $4 million from insider trading over the past three years, based on tips from Mr. Vaskevitch about deals involving Merrill Lynch clients. 

   The SEC memorandum alleged that Mr. Sofer unsuccessfully tried to transfer to Switzerland about $500,000 from a brokerage account in which he allegedly made insider trades. 
Earlier this year, Mr. Sofer transferred about $1.9 million from the brokerage account to a Swiss Bank, the SEC charged. 

   Thomas C. Newkirk, an SEC lawyer, said Mr. Sofer's lawyer in New York has indicated that Mr. Sofer plans to fight for control of his assets overseas, where the U.S. court's freeze order might not be enforceable. 
Mr. Sofer hasn't decided whether to contest the U.S. court over his U.S. assets, Mr. Newkirk said. 
The SEC has declined to disclose the amount of Mr. Sofer's and Mr. Vaskevitch's assets. 

   Mr. Sofer's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, declined to comment. 

   The SEC is seeking penalties in the insider trading case of as much as three times the alleged illicit profit, or a maximum penalty of more than $12 million. 
If the defendants' assets in the U.S. are not sufficient, the stage could be set for a fight to seize assets in foreign countries such as Switzerland. 

   Friday's 10-day extension of the asset freeze was made by Judge Robert W. Sweet. 
Judge Sweet said the extension would give him time to review the SEC's request for a longer-term preliminary injunction against Mr. Vaskevitch and Mr. Sofer.

<HL> Slow West German Growth Saps Europe
And Dims U.S. Hopes on Trade Deficit

<TEXT>
   A year ago, economists were predicting a West German boom that would propel West Europe to its best economic performance since the 1970s. 
It never materialized and today, Europe's economic engine is running out of steam. 

   No one is forecasting a recession in Germany. 
But it is likely that its economy won't expand this year at even the modest 2% rate forecast only a few months ago -- and that it will actually decline in the current quarter. 

   The slowdown is casting a shadow over the globe. 
Germany accounts for one-fourth of the output of the 12-nation European Community, so its weakness is sapping the continent of economic vitality. 

   Despite strength in Britain and Italy, Common Market growth is expected to sag to 2% this year from the 3.5% annual rate in 1986's second half. 
The sluggishness is depriving the U.S. of the surge in European imports it needs to narrow its trade deficit, and is dimming hopes for an easing of the world debt crisis. 

   The Reagan administration is still urging Bonn to revive its economy. 
It argues that because Germany has the smallest budget deficits, the lowest inflation and the largest economy in Europe, it is in the best position to stimulate growth. 

   The Germans have agreed to add about $3 billion to an existing $5 billion tax-cut package, which takes effect next January. 
But so far they haven't shown any inclination to take the stronger action demanded by Washington and some European trading partners. 

   Yet evidence is mounting that Europe's economic motor has fallen out of the car. 
The Bundesbank recently reported, for example, that domestic manufacturing orders fell an unusually sharp 4% in January from the previous month. 

   "The latest signs are quite disturbing," says Klaus Friedrich, an economist specializing in German affairs at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. 
He adds that the "weakness is from a base that was already meager." 

   Economist J. Paul Horne of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in Paris, finds the evidence equally troubling. 
"The West German economy is very vulnerable," he says. 
If the Germans "let things go as they are, then a further weakening of the dollar could move them dangerously toward zero growth." 

   Instead of "dithering," Mr. Horne adds, "the German government would be well advised to step on the gas a little bit." 

   Germany's inflation-adjusted growth of 2.4% last year was its worst showing since the economy climbed out of recession in 1983. 
Experts project a slack 1%-to-2% gain for all of 1987 -- and a contraction of as much as 1% in the first quarter. 

   Initially, they had figured that domestic demand, benefiting from lower oil prices, would fill the economic void left by diminishing exports. 
That happened, to some extent. 
But what the economists didn't foresee was the precipitous decline in the dollar and the dramatic impact that would have on the German economy. 
Because Germany depends on exports for one-third of its economy, the impact of a slowdown in trade is profound. 
Export volume grew less than 1% last year, compared with a 6% increase in 1985. 

   As exports shrivel, German businesses are becoming pessimistic and cautious, lowering production and inventories. 

   German business is also scaling back investment, which until recently had reached record levels. 
Capital spending by German firms this year is expected to run only slightly ahead of 1986 levels, after gains of 9% in 1985 and 5% last year. 
"German exporters have stopped buying capital goods," says the Fed's Mr. Friedrich. 

   Some big companies anticipate outright declines. 
Siemens AG, the electronics giant that makes half of its $25 billion annual sales outside Germany, says it intends to cut capital outlays about 3% this year. 
The decision follows three years in which annual spending more than tripled to $3.4 billion. 

   "Things are slowing down," says one Siemens official. 
"The business climate just isn't as favorable as it was." 

   His sentiment is widespread. 
Last month IFO, the Munich-based economic research institute, recorded its steepest decline in German business confidence in more than three years. 

   Germany's manufacturing sector also faces possible labor unrest. 
Bargaining with IG Metall, the powerful union that represents more than three million workers in the automobile and metal-working industries, is expected to be contentious as negotiators work to reach a new contract in the next few months. 
The union's walkout in 1984 crippled the West German economy. 

   But the biggest potential shock could come from further weakness in the dollar. 
The U.S. currency has firmed since the meeting of finance ministers in Paris last month and is trading in a narrow range of about 1.85 marks. 
The threat of central bank intervention could prevent sharp deviation from that level. 

   If the dollar doesn't remain stable -- if it weakens to 1.75 marks or even lower -- trade would contract even further and a recession might then become imminent, economists fear. 

   The strong mark, meanwhile, is a double-edged detriment to the German economy: Not only does it make German exports more expensive, it also forces some businesses to expand activities outside Germany, where costs are lower. 

   Ford of Europe Inc., for instance, is building new engines at its plant in Britain rather than sticking with plans to make them at a factory in Germany. 
The 26% appreciation of the mark against the British pound in the past two years means that British production offers a $50, or 10%, cost advantage on each engine. 

   "Britain is definitely more competitive," says William Hayden, Ford's vice president of manufacturing, who expects the current relationship between the pound and the mark to hold for a few years.

   More housing units are available than ever before, but housing costs still climbed faster than overall consumer prices in the early 1980s, the Census Bureau reported. 

   The bureau said the number of housing units in the country will reach 100 million by the end of March. 
John Keane, the bureau's director, called that "a record of historical significance." 
But in a separate report, the bureau noted that housing costs have risen faster in the 1980s, contributing to a drop in the rate of home ownership over the past six years. 

   The bureau said the consumer price index rose 17% during 1980-1983, while monthly housing costs rose 26% for homeowners with mortgages and 27% for homeowners without mortgages. 
Renters fared even worse: The cost of rent and utilities rose 31% in the early 1980s. 
During 1980-1983, the median value of owner-occupied housing units increased 16% and the sales price of new homes increased 17%. 

   The decline in the home-ownership rate during the 1980s has been the first drop since the Census Bureau began tracking such figures in 1940. 
From the 1980 peak of 65.8%, the percentage of units owned or partially owned by at least one occupant fell to a low of 63.5% in the last quarter of 1985. 
In the last quarter of 1986 the homeownership rate was 63.9%, but census officials said the increase may not be statistically significant. 

   Arthur F. Young, director of the bureau's housing division, said the home-ownership rate increased just 2.5 percentage points during the 20 years between the 1960 and 1980 censuses. 
"What has happened in the last six years since 1980 has been a faster falloff than the increase in the previous 20 years," he said. 

   Mr. Young pointed to the 1981-82 recession and high interest rates, as well as increased home prices, as reasons for the decline in home ownership. 

   "There is a lot of housing out there," Mr. Young said. 
"The real problem is whether the price fits the market." 

   The bureau said the South has led the nation in housing starts since the agency began tracking such information. 
Housing units tracked by the survey include apartments, mobile homes, and vacation homes, as well as single-family homes.

   Endotronics Inc. said its outside auditor withdrew approval of the troubled biotechnology company's fiscal 1986 financial statements. 

   The auditor, Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co., said Friday that "in light of . . . serious questions" about the company's full-year revenue figure, "we cannot satisfy ourselves as to the true facts of the situation." 
For the fiscal year ended last Sept. 30, Endotronics reported net income of $1.3 million, or 13 cents a share, on revenue $13.1 million. 

   Shortly before the auditor's withdrawal, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who searched warehouses here asserted in an affidavit that many of the company's cell-replicating machines reported as sold actually remained under Endotronics' control. 

   Endotronics said it was providing documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and acknowledged a grand jury investigation into its operations, but declined to comment on the FBI agent's affidavit. 

   In a related action, the company's board and Hoechst Celanese Corp., which owns 36% of Endotronics common stock, were sued in federal district court here by six Endotronics holders for allegedly issuing false financial statements. 
A spokesman at the unit of Hoechst AG of West Germany had no immediate comment. 

   As previously reported, founders Eugene Gruenberg and Micheal Gruenberg resigned as chairman and president, respectively. 
On Friday, Micheal Gruenberg also resigned from the board, but remains Endotronics' director of science. 

   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Endotronics shares fell $1 to close at $1.

   Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc. said it raised prices on some of its 1987-model cars as much as 2.9%. 

   The auto maker said the price increases result from the continued appreciation of the yen against the dollar. 
The average increase is about 1.8%, Toyota said. 

   The biggest increase, $350, is on the Toyota Celica coupe, which will cost $12,388. 
The smallest increase is on the Toyota Tercel three-door liftback, which jumped 1.4%, or $100, to $7,458, the company said. 

   Toyota said the prices of 16 1987 models weren't increased.

   For a moment, the TV commercial could pass for a Miller Lite advertisement. 
Bubba Smith sits under a tree, reading. 
Dick Butkus approaches, toting a football. 

   But this time the burly former football players aren't pushing beer; they're selling Bibles. 
And soon a curious Mr. Butkus snatches one, called "The Book," from Mr. Smith and begins poring through it. 

   Celebrity testimonials, long a staple in selling more secular products, are just part of a recent move by Bible publishers to use modern marketing techniques. 
Like merchandisers of soap, cereal and automobiles, Bible companies are concocting slick packaging, going after demographic niches and spinning off new products. 

   "They're now using the Harvard Business School approach to marketing, sometimes in very sophisticated ways," says John Dessauer, the director of a center for book-industry research at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania. 
"There's a big change in philosophy." 
And it is producing major changes in the $200-million-a-year retail market for Bibles. 

   As a nearly 2,000-year-old product -- and a book that tells a well-known story -- the Bible presents an unusual marketing challenge. 
For centuries, the approach focused on fresh translations -- more than 100 in English alone since about 1900 -- along with, of course, the Bible's continuing appeal to the faithful. 
Even in the modern era, publishers primarily tapped more-or-less captive markets, with half their sales made to churches and other quantity buyers. 
But publishers were relatively passive toward individual consumers. 

   With a rise in visibility of born-again Christianity, total Bible sales grew 10% or more annually from the late 1970s through 1983; annual sales included an estimated 15 million commercial copies by 1984. 
The conservative-Christianity movement also helped bring a new breed of marketer to religious publishing. 

   Bruce Ryskamp, the president of the Bible group of Zondervan Corp., a Grand Rapids, Mich., publisher, for example, had been a marketing executive for a Yellow Pages publisher. 
He says he decided in 1983 to work for Zondervan because "I really think God was speaking to me." 

   "Things have changed," says Robert Schwalb, vice president of Bible marketing for Thomas Nelson Publishers Inc. of Nashville, Tenn. 
"For a long time the church had branded certain professions 'anti-God,' and advertising probably ranked right up there with pornography." 
Now, even such established publishers as Nelson are taking a new approach. 

   One of the leaders of the marketing vanguard has been Marion G. "Pat" Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network Inc., based in Virginia Beach, Va. 
In 1984 CBN teamed up with Tyndale House Publishers of Wheaton, Ill., to make a radical change in Bible marketing. 
"We looked at it as a consumer product," says David Clark, the marketing vice president of CBN. 
"What would it take to get people to pick this up?" 

   To find out, the partners conducted consumer focus groups and surveyed mall shoppers -- and the results led to a repackaging of Tyndale's mainstay edition. 
They first picked an intriguingly vague title: "The Book." 
They made it a paperback and picked a bold cover, after testing six. 
At $9.95, the price was held below what what they considered the psychologically crucial $10 barrier. 

   They distributed "The Book" through unconventional outlets -- including K marts, hardware stores and groceries -- using catchy displays. 
They lined up a New York advertising agency, prime television time and celebrity endorsements. 
The result: More than two million copies have been sold to date, and Tyndale's share of retail Bible sales now is estimated at 12.5%, up from 11% in 1983. 

   Now that sales of "The Book" are cooling off, Tyndale is trying to sustain its success with spinoffs. 
They include a "one-year edition" organized into daily chunks of reading; a children's version that has sold more than 650,000 copies; a religious board game along the lines of Trivial Pursuit, and "The Book" on cassette tapes. 
And last fall, Tyndale introduced "The Story: From Adam to Armageddon," a chronological version. 

   While perhaps less ambitiously evangelical than CBN's project, Zondervan's efforts are elaborate. 
By the early 1980s, the company's readable yet literal-minded New International Version was enjoying ecumenical appeal. 
But it took a niche-marketing approach, led by Mr. Ryskamp, to make sales boom. 

   Mr. Ryskamp has introduced more than two dozen different splinter editions, helping raise Zondervan's Bible sales to more than $21 million last year, from $11.6 million in 1982. 
The NIV's share of retail Bible sales has risen to some 30% -- for the first time eclipsing, on a current basis, the venerable King James Version, a public-domain translation put out by several concerns. 

   Zondervan has targeted, among other segments, the Missouri Synod of Lutherans, with an edition featuring doctrinal notes; scholars, with five study editions; and schoolchildren, with an edition bound ruggedly like a textbook and printed in sans-serif type. 

   Now Mr. Ryskamp is pondering a large-print edition, in five volumes for easy handling; the book might carry added advice about death, illness, inheritance and other topics of interest to the elderly. 
Other possibilities: a Spanish-and-English edition aimed at Hispanic immigrants, and one for blacks, perhaps with "black-English" references. 

   Faced with the innovative competition and an overall flat market since 1984, Nelson, the biggest U.S. religious publisher, lost market share and now is trying to recover ground. 
Its "Precious Moments Bible," illustrated with a popular line of cherubic children's characters, has sold more than a million copies in about a year. 

   Still, not all marketing strategies deliver. 
A spokesman for Reader's Digest Association Inc. says the Pleasantville, N.Y., publisher is "generally pleased" with sales of more than 500,000 copies of its condensed edition, introduced in 1982. 
But others maintain that the book hasn't materialized as the significant competitor it was expected to be. 

   And in their rush to create new versions, the publishers still arouse controversy. 
Some have gotten themselves into a theological thicket over the Apocrypha, for example, a group of books in the Roman Catholic Bible that Protestants don't recognize. 
Zondervan, from a fundamentalist Protestant heritage, is hesitant about an NIV translation of the Apocrypha. 
But Nelson is pursuing the Catholic market with editions that include it -- prompting criticism from some members of the larger Protestant market. 

   More troubling to publishers -- many of whom have evangelical as well as commercial motives -- are indications of a different problem: Despite the sales efforts, the number of regular Bible readers may be slipping. 
A Gallup survey this year found that only 11% of the respondents had said they read the Bible daily, compared with 15% in a 1982 survey. 
Says Mr. Ryskamp: "All we can do is get the Bible to them. 
After that, it's in God's hands."

   Cook United Inc. estimated that it will report net income of about $28 million for the year ended Jan. 31, compared with a year-earlier loss of $30.8 million. 

   It estimated that sales totaled $217 million, compared with the year-earlier $257 million. 

   Cook, which emerged Oct. 13 from bankruptcy-law protection, estimated that it had a loss of $16 million before a special credit of about $44 million. 
The credit resulted mainly from forgiveness of debt as a result of its bankruptcy-law reorganization. 

   Cook didn't estimate fourth-quarter results. 
However, the indicated fourth-quarter net loss is about $10 million. 

   For the nine months ended Nov. 8, Cook reported a loss of $6.5 million before the one-time credit, on sales of $159.1 million. 
The credit of about $44 million made net income $38.2 million, or $5.26 a share. 
In the year-earlier period, Cook posted a net loss of $20.8 million on sales of $189.6 million. 

   Cook, an operator of discount stores, added that it has closed several unprofitable stores and begun discussions with private investors about acquiring stock in the company. 
As part of its reorganization, several creditors forgave debt for equity in Cook. 
The company currently has 10 million shares outstanding.

<HL> Exxon Official Sees a Significant Rise
In Price of Oil as Inevitable Before Long

   A top official of Exxon Corp. said the company now considers an eventual significant rise in the price of oil to be "inevitable." 

   In a speech delivered to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association, Donald K. McIvor, an Exxon senior vice president, said that the world is consuming about twice as much petroleum as is being found and that almost all the world's excess oil-producing capacity, estimated at 20%, lies in the Middle East. 
"Unless huge new discoveries are made -- an unlikely event in my view -- we're going to become increasingly dependent on the large remaining reserves of a few Middle East countries," he said. 

   Mr. McIvor's comments were the first definitive declaration that the world's largest oil company expects a significant recovery in oil prices. 
Responsible for Exxon's world-wide exploration and development activities, Mr. McIvor was to deliver the speech in Queensland, Australia, Monday morning (yesterday at 7:30 p.m. EST) but was unable to because of schedule changes. 
His comments were delivered instead by Stuart R. McGill, chairman of Esso Australia Ltd., an unit of New York-based Exxon. 

   As previously reported, Lawrence G. Rawl, Exxon's chairman, and Lee R. Raymond, president, said that Exxon's internal planning is based on the price of oil staying relatively flat -- in real terms -- for a few years and then rising faster than the rate of inflation. 
Though Mr. McIvor wasn't specific on the timing, he did stress in his speech that "it seems inevitable that the price of oil must rise significantly again before too long." 

   Mr. McIvor noted that the world has been using oil at rates of 20 billion to 25 billion barrels a year since 1970, while discoveries have been accumulating at only 10 billion to 15 billion barrels a year. 
"This means that, to a significant degree, we're using up the inventory found prior to 1970 at an increasing rate," he said. 

   Although 30,000 oil fields have been discovered in the world to date, Mr. McIvor said, 35% of all the oil ever found is in just 37 fields, and all but 11 of these "super giants" are in the Middle East. 
Moreover, he said, only five super-giant fields have been found in the past 20 years, and only two of these -- Prudhoe Bay in the U.S. and Cantarell in Mexico -- are outside the Middle East. 
"As supply and demand come closer together, as they must do at some point, the world's spare capacity is going to be in a very few countries," he said. 

   Mr. McIvor stressed that he isn't dismissing continued oil exploration as fruitless. 
He cited "definite potential" for economic exploration and development of oil outside the Middle East. 
"Valuable discoveries continue to be made each year in scores of countries around the world," he said. 
Nonetheless, he said, "most major consuming countries, including those with substantial production of their own, will ultimately come to depend heavily on Middle East oil." 

   Exxon is more sanguine on the outlook for world-wide natural gas supplies. 
Natural gas "will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the world's energy supply," Mr. McIvor said. 
And as oil prices rise, he added, nonconventional sources such as shale oil and the conversion of natural gas and coal to synthetic oil will become important.

<HL> Mubarak Seeks New Mandate for Leaner Times Ahead

Egyptian President Promises Fair Vote,
But Opposition Still Grumbles

<TEXT>
   A journalist recently asked Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak how he would like to be known among his people. 
He replied that, above all, he wanted to be known as "a head of state who truly believes in democracy." 

   The burly, plain-spoken Mr. Mubarak often waxes eloquent about his desire to give Egypt true democracy. 
Now, 1987 is shaping up as the year when he has to back up his words with action. 
Mr. Mubarak already has liberalized Egypt's election laws, scheduled elections for the national legislature and begun laying the groundwork for his own reelection to a second six-year term as president. 
All this maneuvering, political observers agree, is designed to win an undisputed electoral mandate that will allow him to rule decisively in the tough economic times that lie ahead for Egypt. 

   But in a country with a history of sham elections, vote rigging and near-dictatorial rule by the president, many are skeptical that Mr. Mubarak will give Egyptians a truly free voice. 
Opposition politicians already are grumbling about the new election law, which sets rules for the April 6 national-legislative elections. 
They assert that the law, while fairer than the one it replaced, still is written to ensure that Mr. Mubarak's ruling National Democratic Party remains in control of the legislature, known as the People's Assembly. 

   Despite Mr. Mubarak's moves to open up Egypt's political system, he and his ruling National Democratic Party still hold nearly all the power. 
The president, a former air force general with strong ties to the military, makes foreign policy decisions with little interference. 
The 458-seat People's Assembly does debate and pass laws affecting domestic policy. 
But it is tame by Western standards and clearly run by the ruling party, which holds 389 of the seats. 

   There are four small opposition parties, ranging from the conservative Wafd to the leftist Progressive Unionist Grouping. 
They are noisy but have little clout, and only three of them are represented in the assembly. 
Still, serious political campaigning is under way by the ruling party as well as the opposition. 
Hundreds of handpainted campaign banners flutter in the Cairo breeze, candidates barnstorm the countryside and Islamic groups hold street rallies for their candidates. 

   The election is important mostly because the new assembly will nominate a single candidate for president when Mr. Mubarak's term expires in October. 
The nominee then will have to be approved in a national referendum. 

   The assembly almost certainly will nominate Mr. Mubarak if he wants to run again. 
While the president's supporters once thought he mightn't accept another term, they now say the flurry of political activity proves he wants to be reelected. 

   Mr. Mubarak seems deeply concerned that his reelection appear fair and legitimate. 
He apparently is bargaining that the public will consider the new People's Assembly to have been fairly elected, so a cloud of illegitimacy won't hang over his head when the assembly nominates him for reelection. 

   "He is keen to be nominated by a constitutional body," explains Mohammed Sid-Ahmed, a writer and prominent figure in the leftist Progressive Unionist Grouping party. 
"The coming period is a very critical economic period. 
He wants the central authority to be solid." 

   Mr. Mubarak, who took office when Anwar Sadat was assassinated by Moslem extremists in 1981, maintains that the development of democracy will keep Egypt stable at a time when low oil prices, fewer jobs for Egyptians in the Persian Gulf and galloping population growth are unsettling the economic climate. 
He also believes that the development of democracy in Egypt, the most populous Arab nation and a traditional leader in the region, will affect the entire Middle East. 

   Mr. Mubarak already has allowed opposition political parties to operate freely and to publish newspapers that often are harshly critical of the government. 
He also allowed relatively free campaigning for the previous People's Assembly election in 1984 -- though charges of vote-rigging arose after the ruling party won 73% of the seats. 

   Opposition politicians have sought in Egyptian courts to have the law under which the People's Assembly was elected in 1984 declared unconstitutional. 
They say that because the law required all candidates to belong to political parties, independents were effectively banned. 
Instead of fighting back in the courts, Mr. Mubarak issued a decree Feb. 4 dissolving the existing People's Assembly and scheduling elections under a new law allowing independent candidates. 

   But opposition parties still aren't happy because, while independent candidates are free to run, the new law still says that parties must win at least 8% of the national vote to get any seats in the legislature. 

   This threshold makes it difficult for the country's small opposition parties to win any seats at all. 
Only the conservative Wafd opposition party won more than the required 8% in the 1984 election, and it took 59 seats. 
Two other opposition parties are represented in the People's Assembly, but only because President Mubarak, in a goodwill gesture, appointed five of their members. 
He also appointed five other legislators from minority groups, increasing total membership in the assembly to 458. 

   Opposition politicians also are clamoring for direct presidential elections, rather than a referendum that simply approves a candidate chosen by the legislature. 

   Above all, opposition politicians simply doubt that the bureauracy will allow a fair vote even if President Mubarak says he wants one. 
They say government functionaries in towns and villages consider it their duty to protect the president and his officials, so they pressure citizens to vote for the ruling party. 
And opposition leaders charge that the Interior Ministry, which oversees elections, regularly inflates the vote for the ruling party. 

   There isn't much chance Mr. Mubarak can really lose from his election gambit. 
His party so dominates the scene that it surely will attract far more support than any other, regardless of how fair the vote counting is. 
But Mr. Mubarak's rhetoric about democracy will lose credibility if the vote appears unfair. 

   Despite their grumbling and the long odds, opposition politicians are remaining in the campaign. 
Some even are trying to improve their chances by combining forces. 
The small Labor and Liberal parties have allied with the Moslem Brotherhood, an Islamic political organization that is legally barred from forming a party of its own. 

   Formation of this alliance has meant that the demands of Islamic fundamentalists, particularly their insistence that Egypt adopt a strict Islamic legal code, have become part of the campaign.

Guggenheim Plan Is Wrong for Wright
---
By Manuela Hoelterhoff</HL>
<DD> 03/23/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> NEW YORK </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the Guggenheim Museum tinkered with art the way it does with Frank Lloyd Wright's building, nobody would give it any. 
Wright's dynamic 1959 masterwork, his only building in New York, is arguably the most interesting sculpture the museum has. 
Already, in 1968, the museum attached to its northern side an ugly, lozenge-decorated annex. 
Only a few years later, museum officials inserted a bookstore and restaurant into the ground floor of the smaller rotunda. 
Filling in this open area under the spiral drastically reduced the museum's swirl and swagger. 

   It's not an architectural record inspiring any confidence, but now the museum, still under the same director, Thomas Messer, is proposing another, much-larger addition to Wright's building. 
Having withdrawn an earlier design, the museum has a revised plan by the same architecture firm, Gwathmey Siegel, speeding through city channels. 
Not an inch of it suggests any new recognition on the museum's part of the uniqueness of a building to which it now hopes to affix a mediocre and unnecessary addition by maneuvering its way around zoning regulations. 

   This all-consuming effort to alleviate a self-inflicted space crunch (why did the museum accept thousands of art works it knew could never be exhibited?) began last year with the museum's first proposal for a 162-foot-high, cantilevered and tiled box over the smaller rotunda. 
Many meetings, press conferences and hearings later, the museum thought better of it. 
"We came to feel we would be well-advised not to press our suit too far," said Mr. Messer explaining this decision as he simultaneously introduced the new design earlier this January. 

   Was that ever a sound feeling -- and a clever move. 
No seismograph was necessary to sense that the Board of Standards and Appeals -- whose approval the museum needs for its zoning variances -- thought the first proposal as preposterous as the presentation. 
Are you saying Wright's building is "functionally obsolete" and no longer suited "for the full and expanded mission of the Guggenheim?" asked the caustic head of the BSA, Sylvia Deutsch. 
She had just endured the museum director's anguished litany of what a big bother Wright's building was to operate. 
And she had witnessed an endless parade of backslapping, artspeak-spouting museumniks, who all proved as embarrassing for the museum's cause as the proposed addition's startling resemblance to a flush toilet. 

   A fit of creativity has now replaced this curiosity with an outsized filing cabinet. 
Meant for insertion behind the museum, this 133-foot-high limestone-clad structure uses the foundations of the annex that will be torn down. 
It's an improvement over the first proposal, all right, but that's not saying very much at all. 
This addition isn't really architecture; it's strategy. 
While seeming humble, and cutting a few feet here and a few inches there, the museum is still doing exactly what it shouldn't and needn't be doing: planning to mess with a 20th-century monument. 

   Currently, there's still some air around Wright's museum. 
Nothing interferes with the big rotunda's dimensional presence. 
Putting a slab partly behind it not only dwarfs the entire museum, it anchors the rotunda and eliminates the upward sweep and flow of the arc. 

   The addition doesn't, of course, need to be this high. 
The slab's top is filled with offices, which the museum refuses to relocate up the block where real estate has been readily available. 
Neither has it seriously explored going underground for space. 
At a recent hearing, architect Charles Gwathmey made excavating two floors sound as difficult as drilling a hole to China. 
His view contrasts with that of excavation specialist Mel Febesh. 
"We do this kind of work every day. 
Safely," says Mr. Febesh, president of Urban Substructures Inc., which was hired by Guggenheim Neighbors, a group opposing the slab. 
In terms of space and cost, an underground vault compares favorably with above-ground construction. 

   So this obsession with wing-building only makes any sense if one realizes that it is an essential element in landing 10 canvases by impressionist and modern masters belonging to Mrs. Justin Thannhauser, whose late husband is already memorialized in the museum's permanent collection. 
Museum officials won't disclose details of the proposed bequest, but you can bet that the new addition will be emblazoned with the Thannhauser name, in another example of the death-defying egotism that already haunts so many museums. 

   Perhaps more information will be divulged when the museum pleads its bogus case in front of the BSA next month. 
Its chances are better than before, with the museum's tactic of proposing something so horrible and then kindly substituting something less offensive, reducing a few critics to slobbering gratitude. 
Ms. Deutsch, whose acute questions at last year's hearings sent the museum into appalled huddles, has moved to the City Planning Commission. 
The feisty opposition group is deeply in debt and has been hard put to combat the museum's flashy P.R. outfit, its expensive lawyers and puissant board. 
But its battle is worth supporting. 
New York has only one Guggenheim. 
Let's keep it the way Wright built it.

Shrinking Wage Gap
Helping U.S. Firms

   Since 1982, foreign manufacturers have enjoyed considerably lower labor costs than U.S. companies. 
But the gap between U.S. and foreign pay is disappearing quickly, a clear sign that the falling dollar is improving the ability of American manufacturers to compete in world markets. 

   From 1982 to 1985, for example, the hourly compensation, when converted to dollars, of Japanese production workers was 50% of U.S. compensation costs. 
This gave Japanese manufacturers a huge cost advantage over U.S. companies. 
But by the end of January, Japanese compensation costs had risen to 79% of the U.S. level, according to estimates by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Largely because of the falling dollar, West German labor costs rose to 120% of those for U.S. production workers from 75% in 1985. 
Total compensation costs -- wages plus benefits -- for workers in Sweden and several other European countries also top U.S. levels. 

   "That's a good sign that the U.S. is regaining its ability to compete," says C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. 

   The U.S. must increase its exports, both to fuel domestic economic growth and to reduce the trade deficit -- nearly $170 billion last year -- which has helped make the U.S. a debtor nation and strained the world economy. 
"Virtually all of the trade improvement must come in the manufactured sector, since agriculture faces a persistent world glut and the services account -- which includes the growing burden of interest payments on the foreign debt -- will be worsening," Mr. Bergsten says. 

   With the falling dollar, U.S. manufacturers are in a pretty good position to compete on world markets. 
Manufacturing productivity has risen smartly. 
"Since the business cycle peak in the third quarter of 1981, output per hour in manufacturing has grown at an average annual rate of 3.8%," according to the 1987 report of the Council of Economic Advisers. 
This is "46% faster than the postwar average of 2.6% per year and more than twice the annual average rate of 1.5% recorded between 1973 and 1981." 

   The combination of rising productivity and low wage increases has held in unit labor costs for manufacturers to an average annual rise of 0.7% since 1981, about one-fifth of the postwar average of 3.4%. 

   In fact, unit labor costs have risen less in the U.S. than in other industrial countries. 
U.S. costs rose 11.2% between 1980 and 1985, compared with a rise of 16.3% in 11 industrial nations -- Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. 

   "In the absence of other developments, the relatively better U.S. performance . . . would have improved U.S. international cost competitiveness," the CEA notes. 
But the U.S. advantage was completely overwhelmed by the rapid rise of the dollar. 
When measured on a dollar basis, foreign unit labor costs actually fell 19.7% between 1980 and 1985. 
However, that gap has been shrinking rapidly with the dollar's fall. 

   A look at Japan shows why. 
According to the BLS, total hourly compensation for production workers rose to 1,599 yen in 1986, up only 3.8% from 1,539 yen in 1985. 
But when the yen wages are converted to dollars to show the impact of exchange rates, compensation rose 47% to the equivalent of $9.50 in 1986 from $6.45 in 1985. 
This is how a Japanese exporter earning revenues in dollars might look at his labor costs. 

   To compensate for the rising yen, Japanese manufacturers are doing exactly what U.S. factories did to cut costs when the dollar was high -- laying off workers, building plants abroad and purchasing more goods from countries such as Taiwan and South Korea, where wages still are low. 

   Although the dollar began to fall two years ago, U.S. trade performance is just beginning to turn around. 
In the final quarter of 1986, net real exports -- the difference between exports and imports adjusted for inflation -- improved by 15.3%, a significant gain after six years of deterioration. 

   Rising import prices are crimping demand for foreign goods and "there are encouraging signs from manufacturers that orders from Europe and Japan are picking up," says Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates. 
The aircraft, computer, electrical machinery, paper, lumber and chemical industries are "experiencing noticeable upswings in foreign demand," Wharton says. 

   The dollar's recent fall should further increase exports, which must expand dramatically to cure America's trade problem. 
"The U.S., as a debtor country, will have to stop spending more than it produces," Mr. Bergsten says. 
"America for many years to come will be producing goods and services for consumption in the rest of the world, in a reversal of the buying-on-credit binge of the past half decade." 
The closing wage gap is crucial to that transition.

<HL> U.S. Is Likely to Decide to Set Sanctions
Against Japanese Microchip Companies

   The Reagan administration is likely to decide this week to impose sanctions on Japanese microchip-makers for violating last summer's semiconductor trade accord. 

   At a meeting Friday, a subcabinet task force reviewed new Commerce Department data and concluded that Japanese manufacturers are continuing to dump their products in third-country markets despite a provision in the July 31 agreement that prohibits such practices. 
The group renewed a recommendation made in late February that the U.S. take punitive action. 
Dumping is selling in foreign markets at prices below the cost of production or fair market value at home. 

   The issue next goes to the cabinet-level Economic Policy Council, which has scheduled a meeting for mid-week. 
Although that panel could postpone any judgments in the case, U.S. officials say it's almost certain to recommend sanctions. 

   Late Friday, officers of several U.S. semiconductor makers met with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and a group of senators and congressmen to renew their plea for sanctions. 

   The panel also is slated to consider whether to retaliate against the Japanese government for refusing to buy U.S.-made supercomputers. 
Although American manufacturers clearly hold the lead in these highly sophisticated products, Tokyo has rejected U.S. pleas that it force its ministries and agencies to relax their ban on importing these devices. 
The issue has become an emotional one here in the U.S. American manufacturers already sell supercomputers to non-government buyers in Japan. 

   U.S. trade strategists still haven't decided precisely how to retaliate on the semiconductor issue. 
They say the most likely option would be for the U.S. to impose punitive tariffs on Japanese products -- such as laser-printers -- that use semiconductors. 
They would do that, rather than trying to limit imports of microchips themselves, to avoid hurting U.S. corporations that use imported microchips in the products they make. 

   Even if the Economic Policy Council agrees to retaliate against the Japanese, the sanctions probably wouldn't take effect until mid-April. 
Current practices require U.S. officials to draw up a list of potential targets and allow affected parties here to comment on their likely impact. 
Washington followed similar procedures earlier this year in imposing tariffs on European wine and cheese imports in retaliation for new Common Market tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports. 
The two sides later worked out a settlement, and the retaliatory tariffs were withdrawn. 

   The council action this week won't deal with charges by U.S. chipmakers that Japan hasn't lived up to promises in the semiconductor accord that it allow U.S. manufacturers to gain a larger share of the microchip market in Japan. 

   The subcabinet-level meeting Friday came as the Japanese government, in an 11th-hour effort to ward off U.S. retaliation, told heads of 10 large Japanese semiconductor makers to increase their purchases of foreign-made microchips and to stop dumping in foreign markets. 
The plea came from Hajime Tamura, the country's trade minister. 

   U.S. officials said it was unlikely that Mr. Tamura's action would have any effect on the Economic Policy Council's decision this week. 
The U.S. warned Japan in November that U.S. manufacturers were unhappy with the way the pact was being enforced. 
Tokyo has announced several moves to crack down on violations, but so far none has succeeded. 

   Separately, the two countries announced that Japan has agreed to open its markets to U.S. exports of processed pollack and herring. 
Import quotas have barred such sales in the past. 

   Specifically, Japan will broaden its quota system and issue enough import licenses to accommodate all U.S. exports of these products. 
U.S. officials estimate that the move will result in $85 million in additional U.S. sales this year, and that such sales eventually could grow to $300 million annually. 

   The U.S.-Japan semiconductor accord, negotiated at the request of some U.S. microchip makers, provided for Japanese producers to stop dumping both here and in third-country markets. 
It also called on Japan to allow U.S. producers a larger share of Japan's own market. 
However, because the dumping involves actions by private concerns rather than by the Japanese government, it has proved difficult to enforce.

<HL> Wider Uses Seen for Heart Drug,
But Side Effects Pose a Challenge

   Treatment for the ailing heart may soon get better, but scientists say it won't get simpler. 

   Tissue plasminogen activator, Genentech Inc.'s promising clot-dissolving drug, may win Food and Drug Administration approval in a few months as a treatment for heart attack -- an event that befalls 1.5 million Americans a year and kills 550,000 of them. 
Twice as effective as conventional clot dissolvers, with less internal bleeding and bruising, TPA is expected to become biotechnology's first billion-dollar product by the early 1990s. 
Researchers now speak of expanding its use to a panoply of cardiovascular diseases. 

   But what the public may not realize in the early excitement over TPA is that high dosages of the drug still pose a risk of internal bleeding, and that not all heart-attack patients are appropriate candidates for it. 
Further, despite TPA's apparent superiority over conventional therapy in prolonging life, statistical proof remains elusive. 

   Although these complications have been discussed in medical circles, popular news articles about TPA -- and even Genentech itself -- appear to have underplayed side effects. 
The company's annual report, for example, has a dramatic photo of a patient receiving intravenous TPA en route to a hospital. 
However, Genentech's top management now disavows any early hope of widespread paramedic application. 

   One result of minimizing problems with the drug may be disappointment for people who had hoped to see it used widely and freely. 
Another may be that patients who shouldn't take TPA will press their doctors to prescribe it. 

   "The use of this drug isn't idiot-proof," Eugene Braunwald of the Harvard Medical School told scientists and doctors at a recent Harvard-Genentech seminar on TPA in New Orleans. 
TPA "is going to be an enormous challenge to the medical profession," he added. 
Scientists agreed that expert medical care and control must guide TPA's administration. 

   TPA dazzled the medical world in 1985, when the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute reported the drug had opened clogged arteries in 66% of test patients -- twice as many as the the previously most potent clot-dissolving agent, streptokinase, made by the U.S. unit of Hoechst AG of West Germany and by Kabivitrum AB of Sweden. 
By now, TPA has been given to about 4,000 patients world-wide, and its clot-dissolving record tops 80%. 

   But balancing bleeding and clotting is complex. 
Researchers recently disclosed that more than 1% of patients in a later phase of the institute's study suffered bleeding in the brain while on a high-dose regimen. 
"I don't want to suggest that we can use infinitely high-dose TPA, or even a modest dose for an extended period, without the risks of bleeding," said Burton Sobel of Washington University, St. Louis. 

   Nor is TPA the solution for all heart-attack patients. 
It works better in a first heart attack than in later ones, says Eugene Passamani, a clinical researcher at the heart institute. 
And it should be used soon after an attack, but researchers at New Orleans differed on whether the cutoff should be at four hours, six hours or later. 
Some researchers say TPA's use should be restricted to patients with "anterior myocardial infarct," a serious heart attack damaging the heart's forewall. 
Finally, bleeding risks grow in patients over 70. 

   Because heavy demand is expected for the drug, some analysts distinguish between how many people should get TPA and how many people will get it. 
Robert Kupor, an analyst at Cable Howse &amp; Ragen of Seattle, contends that 250,000 to 300,000 should get the drug. 
"But," he says, "probably (500,000) patients actually will get it due to pressure on doctors in marginal cases." 
On that basis, he projects probable U.S. sales totaling $700 million to $750 million in 1990, with royalties from foreign licenses boosting final TPA revenue to $850 million. 
Genentech calculates the "eligible population" at about 750,000 a year. 

   But early indiscriminate demand for TPA may be tempered as patients encounter bleeding, says M. Kathleen Behrens, an analyst with Robertson, Colman &amp; Stephens in San Francisco. 
Doctors are bracing for lawsuits. 
If malpractice experience with streptokinase is a guide, doctors will be sued for giving the drug -- if a patient bleeds -- or for withholding it. 

   How well TPA will improve the survival rate of heart-attack patients isn't clear. 
Genentech scientists infer that, because streptokinase clearly saved lives in European studies and because TPA dissolves clots better than streptokinase, TPA will improve survival significantly. 
But current statistics are equivocal. 
Dr. Passamani of the heart institute says it would take many more thousands of test patients to prove TPA's superiority. 

   Meanwhile, other researchers are testing TPA in other cardiovascular diseases. 
These include: unstable angina, the chest pain that may precede heart attack; pulmonary embolism, a blood clot in the lung; and peripheral arterial occlusion, blockage often due to a leg clot. 

   Chest pain, sometimes from clot buildup in the heart, affects millions of Americans, some of whom later suffer heart attacks. 
Herman K. "Chip" Gold, a researcher at Harvard and the Massachusetts General Hospital, studied about two dozen angina patients, giving half TPA and half a placebo. 
Pain persisted in six of 11 placebo patients but in only one of 12 TPA patients. 
Eleven of the TPA patients bled, only three of them seriously. 

   Dr. Gold, who also serves as a consultant for Genentech, asserts that further angina studies may lead to a role for TPA in preventing heart attack. 

   Pulmonary embolism can lead to heart dysfunction, hypertension and death. 
But Samuel Z. Goldhaber of Harvard and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston reported that TPA dissolved lung clots in 44 of 47 patients he tested, most without major complications. 
However, he noted that two of them bled seriously enough to require surgery. 

   Peripheral artery blockage responded well to TPA in early tests, according to Robert Graor of the Cleveland Clinic. 
Dr. Graor told the New Orleans group that clots dissolved in 61 of 65 such patients, although 76% of them also required later surgery or angioplasty. 
He believes TPA is safer than streptokinase. 

   Despite Genentech's long head start in developing and marketing TPA, it has aggressive competition from the team of Genetics Institute Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., and Wellcome PLC of London, which goes to court in June to try to block Genentech's UK patent on TPA. Other contenders include the Swiss-American Biogen Inc., Integrated Genetics Inc., Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and Chiron Corp. 

   Just as penicillin ushered in a new age of antibiotics, some analysts say TPA may eventually head a group of new clot-dissolving substances. 

   Beecham Laboratories, a unit of Beecham Group of London, is developing a form of streptokinase called "APSAC." 
An agent called "SCUPA" or pro-urokinase, is under development by Grunenthal G.m.b.H. of Germany and Collaborative Research Inc., working with Sandoz Inc., a subsidiary of the Swiss Sandoz Ltd. Victor Gurewich, of St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Boston, told the New Orleans group that heart-attack victims may one day take a sort of synergistic cocktail -- a shot of TPA, with a SCUPA chaser.

<HL> Britain's Goldcrest Films Vies for Oscars
As Potential Buyers Vie for the Company

   Movies from Goldcrest Films &amp; Television Ltd., the biggest name in Britain's movie business, could win a lot of Oscars this month. 
But who will win Goldcrest? 

   Goldcrest, a production company formed 10 years ago by Pearson PLC, has produced both remarkable hits and spectacular flops. 
Pearson has seen enough of both. 
"We now feel the film industry isn't for us," says Alan Whitaker, a director of Pearson, the diversified British conglomerate that, among other things, publishes Penguin books and the Financial Times. 

   Pearson, which owns 41% of Goldcrest, and three institutional investors holding another 18% have agreed to sell most of Goldcrest to Earle I. Mack, a New York real estate developer who has invested in movies. 
But a flurry of interest from British companies dangling the prospect of higher offers than Mr. Mack's is complicating the effort to win approval of other shareholders. 

   To the surprise of its board, Goldcrest "is like the girl at the dance who once the first guy asks her suddenly becomes very attractive," says Jake Eberts, who started the company for Pearson, left in 1983 and returned to rescue it in 1985. 
"We're being approached all the time by people throwing money at us and offering salvation and hope." 

   Despite two hugely expensive box-office disasters in recent years -- "Revolution" and "Absolute Beginners" -- Goldcrest is attracting interest because of its reputation and library of past hits like "Gandhi" and "Chariots of Fire." 
After the equivalent of about $48.2 million of write-offs in the past two years, the company has refocused on its original goal of making quality movies with British talent. 
This year, "The Mission" and "A Room with a View" together received 15 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director nominations for each film. 

   Goldcrest's board has promised to make its "best efforts" to conclude the deal with Mr. Mack, who has offered to buy 85% of Goldcrest for about $9.1 million. 
But the agreement must be approved by holders of 75% of the company at a meeting yet to be scheduled, and that seems far from assured. 

   A bid already has been made by Masterman Productions, an expansion-minded production company owned by Brent Walker Group PLC, a leisure company known for operating dog tracks, and Ensign Trust PLC, an institutional investor. 
Masterman claims control of 13% of Goldcrest and is "reasonably convinced" that holders of another 13% would like Goldcrest to consider other bids, says Philip Axford, a corporate-finance partner at James Capel &amp; Co., Masterman's financial adviser. 
Masterman wants to buy Goldcrest and inject new working capital in a transaction it values at about $18.3 million. 

   Also interested is Hemdale Holdings Ltd., a British-owned production company that finances mostly U.S. movies, including "Platoon" -- the surprise hit that also is up for the Best Picture Oscar. 
Pearson's Mr. Whitaker says two of Britain's largest entertainment companies also have expressed interest: Granada Group PLC, which operates one of the major regional broadcasting franchises, and Virgin Group PLC, a record and music-publishing company that co-financed "Absolute Beginners" with Goldcrest. 

   Mr. Eberts, a Canadian citizen and former Oppenheimer &amp; Co. investment banker, first approached Pearson in 1974 about backing a film of "Watership Down," a novel published by Pearson's Penguin unit. 
Goldcrest was officially formed three years later and reached its zenith with the Oscar-winning "Chariots of Fire" in 1982 and "Gandhi" in 1983. 
In 1984, the last year for which Goldcrest disclosed results, net income was about $2.5 million on sales of around $22.5 million. 
The U.S., Mr. Eberts notes, represents 75% of the market for Goldcrest's movies. 

   Goldcrest decided to become a force in TV programs and even satellites. 
It raised more money from British institutions and took out its first major bank loans. 
In a seeming rush to spend it all, it budgeted approximately $70.6 million for "Absolute Beginners," "Revolution" and "The Mission." 
The films ran far over budget and behind schedule. 
"The Mission," the last of the three to be released, is likely to lose money even if it wins Oscars.

But John Grambling Knows
How to Appeal to Bankers
And How to Fake Assets

   A couple of years back, two businessmen on the make tried to steal $36.5 million from four banks and a savings and loan association. 
And without pointing a gun at anybody, they actually made off with $13.5 million. 
Their .370 batting average wasn't bad, but they got caught. 

   The story of John A. Grambling Jr. and Robert H. Libman, one of the most bizarre in recent banking history, came to light in 1985 and 1986, as the Manhattan district attorney's office in New York was investigating and prosecuting the partners. 

   Court records and interviews with investigators and bank officials show that the tale begins at the end of 1984, when Messrs. 
Grambling and Libman heard that Husky Oil Ltd. wanted to sell its U.S. refineries and gas stations for tax reasons. 
Their acquisitive instincts aroused, the two men set out to buy what Husky was selling. 

   Never mind that they were broke and that Husky's asking price approached $100 million. 

   Messrs. 
Grambling and Libman weren't well known in the business world, either, though Mr. Grambling's father had once been the president of the Texas Bar Association and the family is prominent in El Paso. 

   The partners' scheme involved hitting up Bank of Montreal for $75 million. 
With their loan application, they submitted a detailed balance sheet for Mr. Libman, who is 57 years old, showing his net worth to be $23 million. 
His listed assets ranged from $17.5 million in marketable securities to two Jaguar XJ6s valued at $68,000. 

   The bank refused them the $75 million but did agree to lend Mr. Grambling $7.5 million in interim financing after he offered as collateral 375,000 shares of Dr Pepper stock with a market price of $8,252,992. 
The shares were to be delivered to the bank. 

   The closing of Mr. Grambling's loan took place Dec. 28, 1984, in New York, where Mr. Grambling's former employer, Lazard Freres &amp; Co., was supposedly holding his Dr Pepper shares for him. 
Mr. Grambling, who is 36 years old, had been an associate investment banker at Lazard. 

   The document assigning the stock to Bank of Montreal bore the signatures of Peter Corcoran, a longtime Lazard partner, and Robert Wilkis, a Lazard vice president. 

   At the end of the loan closing, when everything seemed to be in order, a call was placed to Ivor Hopkyns, the Bank of Montreal official handling the loan in Canada. 
And before he would release the $7.5 million to Mr. Grambling, Mr. Hopkyns wanted to chat with Mr. Corcoran. 
Mr. Grambling said that he would have to get Mr. Corcoran's phone number in Florida, where the Lazard official was on vacation. 
That done, Messrs. 
Hopkyns and Corcoran spoke briefly, and Mr. Grambling got his $7.5 million. 

   Bank of Montreal didn't yet have possession of the promised collateral, which under the terms of the transaction didn't have to be delivered to the bank until Jan. 22, 1985, more than three weeks after the bank let the money loose to Mr. Grambling. 

   On Jan. 15, Ivor Hopkyns phoned Mr. Wilkis at Lazard to ask after the Dr Pepper stock. 
And Mr. Wilkis seemed to be irritated by the call. 
He said that this was the first he had heard about any such deal. 

   To the consternation of Mr. Hopkyns, the conversation went something like this (according to both men involved): 

   Mr. Hopkyns: But you signed the loan agreement. 

   Mr. Wilkis: I didn't sign any agreement. 

   Mr. Hopkyns: But I've got the document right in front of me, signed Robert W. Wilkis. 

   Mr. Wilkis: You've got a problem. 
My middle initial is M, not W. 

   Mr. Hopkyns, alarmed, then phoned Mr. Corcoran at Lazard and got another shock. 
When he heard the voice, he realized at once that the Mr. Corcoran he was talking to sounded not at all like the Mr. Corcoran he had phoned in Florida. 

   The truth was that Mr. Grambling didn't own a single share of Dr Pepper. 
The documents were forged; so were the signatures of Messrs. 
Corcoran and Wilkis. 
The Libman balance sheet was made out of whole cloth. 
The Peter Corcoran that Ivor Hopkyns had phoned in Florida was, in reality, Robert H. Libman doing an impersonation. 

   Before the day was out, a worried Mr. Hopkyns phoned Mr. Grambling, who did his best to reassure him. 
Mr. Grambling told him that there had been an administrative foul-up. 
His Dr Pepper shares had mistakenly been transferred to Coronado Bank in El Paso. 

   He promised to straighten things out. 
And, as a gesture of good faith, he volunteered to send Bank of Montreal an unscheduled payment of $2 million, even though the bank wasn't due to get its $8 million in collateral for another seven days. 

   However, among the facts Mr. Grambling failed to disclose to Mr. Hopkyns was that, to keep other creditors at bay, he had spent nearly all the $7.5 million he had borrowed less than three weeks earlier. 
And, of course, he still faced the problem of producing the nonexistent Dr Pepper shares. 

   The $2 million Mr. Grambling then actually did send to Bank of Montreal compounded his financial problems because it came from the proceeds of a $6 million loan he had just obtained, fraudulently, from Colorado National Bank of Denver. 

   Initially, Mr. Grambling had asked Colorado National to lend him $100 million. 
Thomas Foncannon, a Colorado National vice president, said in an affidavit that a loan of $100 million was "quite a bit larger than the bank was comfortable with." 

   Mr. Grambling promptly lowered his sights. 
He said he had interim financing requirements in the Husky Oil deal that the bank could help him with. 
Which is how Colorado National came to lend him the $6 million. 
He got the loan after giving the bank his personal financial statement, which was even more fanciful than Mr. Libman's. 
The statement reported total assets of $40 million, net worth of $39 million and annual income of $908,000. 

   Mr. Foncannon said in his affidavit that his calls to several banks inquiring about Mr. Grambling's reputation had turned up nothing to be concerned about. 
Indeed, several bankers actually praised Mr. Grambling. 
For instance, according to Mr. Foncannon, Charles Worth, a vice president of Arizona's Bank of Scottsdale, characterized his banking relationship with Mr. Grambling as "super." 

   Boy and man, John Grambling was always popular. 
In high school, he was a member of the speech team. 
As an undergraduate at Southern Methodist University, he was elected president of his dormitory and an officer of his fraternity. 
He was bright, too. 
He earned an M.B.A. degree at the Wharton School of Finance. 
A schoolmate characterized him as the last person anyone would suspect of fraud. 

   But, with bankers, he had more than a winning personality going for him. 
In at least three instances, he had made loan repayments ahead of schedule. 
He repaid $708,000 to Bank of Scottsdale, $1.8 million to American Bank of Commerce in El Paso and $418,000 to First Financial Bank of El Paso. 

   These payments depleted the $7.5 million he had borrowed from Bank of Montreal by $2.9 million but made him look like a better risk. 

   What Messrs. 
Grambling and Libman were up to here was a Ponzi scheme, which works like this: You fraudulently obtain a loan from Bank A. 
You go on to Bank B and get another loan, using some of Bank B's proceeds to pay back some of your debt to Bank A. 
That keeps creditors satisfied temporarily and preserves your credit rating for a foray against Bank C. 

   Brian Rosner, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan who eventually prosecuted Messrs. 
Grambling and Libman for bank fraud, says of the Ponzi ploy: "It's called robbing Peter to pay Paul, and as long as it works -- as long as the money comes in -- no one knows he's being victimized." 
Besides, he says, "No one is more complacent than a banker who has been repaid." 

   But Bank of Montreal officials -- anything but complacent -- instructed their New York law firm, Shearman &amp; Sterling, to alert the Manhattan district attorney's office to possible crimes within its jurisdiction by Messrs. 
Grambling and Libman. 

   This warning came in early February of 1985, and it signaled trouble for the two freebooters, even though they were well on their way to pulling off three more swindles. 
Their targets and the amounts they sought to borrow (or steal): 

   First Security Bank of Utah in Salt Lake City -- $8 million. 
First Interstate Bank of Denver -- $5 million. 
Security Savings &amp; Loan Association, Jackson, Miss.$10 million. 

   Again, Mr. Grambling used his well-tested techniques for separating bankers from their money. 
He doctored loan agreements and other documents. 
Once more, he wildly misrepresented his net assets. 
And he got Mr. Libman to do some new impersonations on the telephone. 

   Mr. Grambling's effort to get millions from First Security Bank came within a whisker of succeeding. 

   He submitted a financial statement to First Security attesting that he owned 358,600 shares of Southern Union Co. stock, shares that had a market value of nearly $10 million. 
And he offered the stock, which, as usual, he didn't truly own, as collateral. 

   To further deceive First Security, he set up a conference call between the bank's loan committee and Mr. Libman posing as Blair Mullin, an actual official of Bank of Montreal. 
As additional collateral, the loan committee accepted the fake Mr. Mullin's assurances that the Utah bank would have recourse to funds from a loan Mr. Grambling was negotiating with Bank of Montreal. 
So assured, the First Security committee agreed to lend him the money. 

   But at the 11th hour, First Security got lucky. 
Scott Clark, a lawyer representing the Utah bank, phoned a man who supposedly was Ronald Keenan, the president of Coronado Bank in El Paso, where Mr. Grambling did some of his banking business. 
Mr. Keenan was portrayed for this occasion by an unidentified impostor (not by Mr. Libman this time). 

   Mr. Clark, who was looking for an agent to hold the 358,600 Southern Union shares and to arrange for their delivery to Salt Lake City, asked who currently had custody of the stock. 

   "Mr. 
Keenan" replied that the local Merrill Lynch office had the certificates. 
Mr. Clark agreed quickly on Merrill Lynch as the agent because it had an office in the bank's Salt Lake City building, which would facilitate delivery of the stock. 
That news jolted the ersatz Mr. Keenan, who knew the Southern Union stock was a figment. 

   He said that he had better confirm that Merrill Lynch did actually hold the certificates. 
He hung up and called back shortly to say he had been mistaken. 
The shares were in the hands of E.F. Hutton's El Paso office, Mr. Keenan said. 
That, too, was just fine with Mr. Clark, because Hutton also had an office in the building. 
At that point, Mr. Keenan said he would again have to check on exactly where the shares reposed. 

   He made another call and came back on the line with the news that the stock was at Eppler, Guerin &amp; Turner, a Texas brokerage firm with no offices whatever in Utah. 

   His suspicions aroused, Mr. Clark demanded to have the original Southern Union stock certificates sent directly to him. 
When Mr. Grambling couldn't deliver nonexistent shares, First Security slipped the swindlers' noose. 

   A few weeks later, Jim Conover, a First Security official, was reminded of how close the bank had come to losing $8 million. 
He remarked: "It's like Vietnam, when you heard the bullets whistling by your head." 

   Mr. Grambling went back to the well again in trying to take First Interstate Bank for $5 million. 
His collateral consisted of phony Southern Union stock, falsely valued at more than $5 million. 
And when it came to staging his $10 million raid on Security Savings &amp; Loan, Mr. Grambling offered $12 million in bogus certificates of deposit. 

   "That representation was false. 
The certificates did not exist. 
Mr. Grambling's Xeroxes of the certificates and other documentary proof of their existence were forgeries," said Mr. Rosner, the Manhattan assistant district attorney in a sworn statement. 

   The string ran out on Mr. Grambling and Mr. Libman in the spring of 1985, after Mr. Rosner presented evidence uncovered in the investigation of the two partners. 
On May 7, 1985, a New York County grand jury indicted Mr. Grambling on 32 counts of bank fraud involving Bank of Montreal, Colorado National Bank, First Security Bank of Utah, First Interstate Bank of Denver and Security Savings &amp; Loan Association of Jackson, Miss. 
Mr. Libman was indicted on two counts -- a conspiracy charge and a fraud charge. 
New York County got jurisdiction over the case because forged documents in the Bank of Montreal loan were submitted to the bank in Manhattan at the loan closing. 

   Initially, Messrs. 
Grambling and Libman pleaded not guilty. 
Then, last October, as their trials in a New York state court grew near, they changed their pleas to guilty. 
Mr. Grambling said in his plea that, at the urging of his family, he is seeing a Yale University psychiatrist once a week. 

   Mr. Libman drew a six-month term in New York's Rikers Island prison and has served his time -- four months, with time off for good behavior. 
The short sentence may reflect Mr. Libman's subordinate role, which Mr. Rosner described in a memorandum to the court: "Although Mr. Grambling was the lead actor, Mr. Libman had more than a walk-on part." 

   Mr. Grambling has yet to be sentenced. 
He faces a maximum of 20 years in prison; fines and restitution could total $40.5 million. 

   But while free on bail, Mr. Grambling was doing business as usual, which turned out to be expensive for two new bank victims. 
It also further embroiled him with the law. 

   Last June, Colonial Bank &amp; Trust Co. in Chicago closed a loan of $350,000 with Mr. Grambling, secured again by phony collateral, this time American Brands shares with a supposed market value of more than $600,000. 
Mr. Grambling made off with $250,000 of the bank's money before Colonial caught on and denied him the remaining $100,000. 

   Mr. Grambling struck again in the fall, when he took CityTrust of Bridgeport, Conn., for $450,000, a loan secured by more than $7 million in such blue-chip stocks as J.P. Morgan, General Motors, Rockwell International, IBM and Standard Oil, all bogus. 
There, he himself posed as one Robert E. Smith Jr., a fictitious agent for an Arizona businessman. 

   None of the money Messrs. 
Grambling and Libman obtained fraudulently from the banks and savings institutions has ever been recovered, though much of the money borrowed from one lender was later repaid to another. 
Bank of Montreal, for example was repaid $2 million but, in the end, got stuck for $5.5 million. 
Colorado National Bank hasn't been repaid any of the $6 million it lent. 

   In December, Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Hartford pondered whether to lend $450,000 to the same Robert E. Smith Jr. but turned him -- that is, Mr. Grambling -- down. 

   Undaunted, Mr. Grambling approached Great American First Savings Bank of San Diego. 
Again he misrepresented himself as the owner of IBM shares, which he offered as collateral for a $350,000 loan. 

   This time the gambit was disastrous for him. 
On Jan. 5, Mr. Rosner received an internal memo from Colonial Bank, which had been defrauded by Mr. Grambling more than six months earlier. (He has yet to be charged in the Colonial Bank case.) 
The memo, dated Dec. 31, 1986, said Mr. Grambling had called Colonial that day to say he was at Great American First in San Diego. 
He was there, he announced, borrowing $350,000, and he would be wiring Colonial Bank the $250,000 he owed. 
The Colonial memo ended: "He continues to amaze." 

   Mr. Rosner promptly phoned the San Diego bank to warn of a fraud in progress. 
Four days later, Mr. Grambling entered Great American First, expecting to get his $350,000. 
Instead, he was arrested by an FBI agent impersonating a loan officer. 

   Unable to make bail of $2 million, Mr. Grambling was jailed in San Diego, where he pleaded guilty to federal bank-fraud charges involving the Great American First loan, and he is to be sentenced today on federal charges by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. 
Then he will be flown to New York for sentencing by the state on April 1. 

   Banks that Messrs. 
Grambling and Libman defrauded or tried to defraud offer various explanations (or none at all) for how such swindles can happen. 
Mr. Clark, the attorney for First Security Bank of Utah, which narrowly escaped the scam, lays blame on competition and on trust. 
"Banks are highly competitive in trying to place good loans," he says. 
In Mr. Grambling's case, he came to the bank in the company of an executive of the Husky Oil refinery in Salt Lake City that Mr. Grambling had hoped to buy. 
That association with respectability and Mr. Grambling's "very nice social graces" gave him credibility with First Security. 
"There's an enormous amount of money banks have and want to lend out," Mr. Clark says. 
"In New York, they want to lend it to Brazil. 
In smaller cities, they like to lend it to the local refinery." 

   A banker who did fall for the scheme and who consented to an interview on the condition that his name wouldn't be published, says he has two ideas about avoiding future rip-offs: "We should tighten up our internal guidelines, and we should be sure we know our borrowers." 
He says that in many years as a banker he has grown accustomed to "dealing with honest people 99% of the time." 
The banking system, he says, "is built on trust." 
And a person intent on bank fraud "is going to get it done." 
As for Mr. Grambling: "He should be compelled to wear a bell around his neck." 

   James Bussitil, a lawyer for Bank of Montreal, said in an interview that "the modern banking system is susceptible to fraud because banking basically operates on the basis of trust. 
We made all the standard checks, and nothing turned up on Grambling." 

   Peter A. Manson, a senior vice president of Bank of Montreal, praised "the diligence of our account managers" in bringing to light Mr. Grambling's fraud. 
He said the incident "has again reminded this bank, and we expect other banks . . . of the need to know your customer." 

   At the end of his spree, Mr. Grambling was hoist with his own petard. 
The Great American First "loan officer" who nabbed him turned out to be an FBI agent. 
Thus, the teacher was taught a lesson he had been busy teaching bankers: Beware of impostors.

Manipulation of Stock
In Fireman's Fund Corp.

   Salim B. "Sandy" Lewis, a well-known arbitrager and former special adviser to the Securities and Exchange Commission, allegedly asked Boyd L. Jefferies to manipulate the stock of Fireman's Fund Corp. last year, according to people familiar with the government's criminal and civil cases against Mr. Jefferies. 

   The government announced last week that Mr. Jefferies, who resigned Thursday as chairman of the Los Angeles-based Jefferies Group Inc. securities firm, agreed to plead guilty to two felonies, one of which was related to an alleged scheme to manipulate the price of Fireman's Fund shares just prior to a secondary stock offering by American Express Co. last May 9. 
The government said Mr. Jefferies is cooperating with the investigation. 

   In settling related charges, the SEC alleged Mr. Jefferies, acting pursuant to an agreement with an individual who wasn't identified, bought huge blocks of Fireman's Fund at or near the close of trading the day before the offering, thereby boosting the price on the day of the offering. 

   Mr. Lewis is the individual referred to by the government, the people familiar with the cases said. 
His name, as well of that of his firm, S.B. Lewis &amp; Co., appeared on subpoenas related to the transaction issued by the government on Friday. 
Mr. Lewis couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Subpoenas were received by American Express, Fireman's Fund's controlling shareholder and former parent; Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., co-manager for the secondary offering and a unit of American Express; and Salomon Brothers Inc., the investment banking firm that was the other co-manager, the companies acknowledged. 

   Also named in subpoenas were Randall D. Smith &amp; Co., a small securities firm, and Randall D. Smith, the firm's founder. 

   The government is seeking to determine whether anyone at American Express, Shearson Lehman or Salomon Brothers asked Mr. Lewis to set up the arrangement with Mr. Jefferies, according to the people familiar with the investigation. 
They said the government is also probing the rise in the price of Fireman's Fund shares that occurred several days earlier in the week before the public offering. 

   Neither Messrs. 
Lewis and Smith nor anyone at any of the firms receiving subpoenas has been charged with any wrongdoing. 
The government said that both SEC and criminal investigations of the matter are continuing. 
Mr. Smith, who is a former partner of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., didn't return phone calls. 
Mr. Jefferies' lawyer, Peter H. Morrison, declined to comment and said Mr. Jefferies wasn't available. 

   The probe of the $332 million Fireman's Fund offering marks a dramatic widening of the government's probe of wrongdoing on Wall Street. 
Not only does the offering under scrutiny involve some of the financial community's most prestigious corporations, but it is the first indication that the scandal has spread from takeovers to the more staid world of corporate finance, traditionally the heart of investment banking. 

   Mr. Lewis, who is 48 years old, has long had close ties to American Express's chairman, James D. Robinson III. American Express helped launch Mr. Lewis's arbitrage firm in 1977 with a $3 million investment, and Mr. Lewis helped arrange American Express's acquisition of Investors Diversified Services Inc. in 1983 and of Shearson in 1981. 
S.B Lewis &amp; Co. earned a $3.5 million fee from the Shearson acquisition, and American Express remains a major investor in Mr. Lewis's firm. 
Mr. Lewis has often acted as an informal adviser to Mr. Robinson on matters of corporate strategy. 

   Mr. Robinson declined to comment on his relationship with Mr. Lewis, but he has told colleagues that he never discussed anything that could be characterized as market manipulation with Mr. Lewis and knew nothing about the alleged manipulation of Fireman's Fund shares. 

   According to the people familiar with the government's investigation, Mr. Lewis asked Mr. Jefferies to boost the price of Fireman's Fund shares May 8, the day before the scheduled public offering. 
Fireman's Fund shares, after rising sharply several days earlier, had begun falling as the offering approached. 
Mr. Lewis agreed to reimburse Mr. Jefferies for any losses incurred on the transactions, the people said. 

   At or near the close of trading that day, Mr. Jefferies purchased four large blocks of stock, pushing the price of Fireman's shares to $38, at least an eighth of a point higher than the price otherwise would have been, the government said. 
Mr. Jefferies subsequently sold his holdings at a loss. 

   As agreed, Mr. Jefferies sent S.B. Lewis &amp; Co. an invoice for about $185,000 for "investment banking services," the people said. 
But Mr. Lewis then asked that another invoice for about $150,000 be sent to Smith &amp; Co., which is active in the junk bond market. 
Smith &amp; Co. subsequently paid the sum to Jefferies &amp; Co., which recorded the payment on its books as "other income." 

   People familiar with the Fireman's Fund offering said Mr. Lewis had no formal role in the offering and would have had no direct incentive to engage in market manipulation or to risk his own capital by reimbursing Jefferies &amp; Co. American Express would have been the most obvious beneficiary of the alleged scheme, since the offering was priced at the close of the market May 8, the day before the public offering. 
The offering was underwritten on a firm commitment basis, meaning that after the price was fixed, the underwriters bore the risk of any subsequent drop in the stock's price. 

   Mr. Robinson said, "We know of absolutely no wrongdoing by anybody at American Express," including Shearson Lehman. 
He said that two law firms hired by the company, Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, worked over the weekend and interviewed everybody involved in the underwriting. 
Mr. Robinson, a personal friend of Mr. Lewis for many years, added, "I would be shocked if Sandy did anything illegal." 

   A Salomon Brothers spokesman said the firm would comply with the subpoena it received and cooperate fully with the SEC. 
He added that the firm knew nothing about a government investigation of the offering before last week's announcements. 

   Within certain limits, it is permissible for underwriters to stabilize the price of a security in a public offering for a relatively brief period after the offering is made. 
However, for anyone to manipulate the price of a security before the offering is made would be illegal. 

   Mr. Lewis has been a highly successful but maverick player on Wall Street. 
His father was Salim Lewis, a legendary Wall Street tycoon who ran Bear Stearns until his death in 1978. 
Sandy Lewis, known equally for his intellectual brilliance, his excitability and volubility and his lack of tact, was hired and fired by several prominent firms before launching his own successful operation. 
During 1977, he became a special adviser to SEC Chairman Harold Williams. 
Investors in his firm have included both Mr. Williams and another former SEC chairman, Roderick Hills, and his wife Carla Hills, former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. 

   People on Wall Street expressed unusual shock at the news that Mr. Lewis had been implicated by Mr. Jefferies. 
Over the years, Mr. Lewis has called for strict compliance with the securities laws and for adherence to the highest ethical standards. 
Mr. Lewis once worked briefly for confessed insider trader Ivan F. Boesky, and ever since, has urged reporters and SEC officials to investigate Mr. Boesky's activities. 
It was Mr. Boesky who implicated Mr. Jefferies, who in turn has led investigators to Mr. Lewis.

   A group of limited partners sued Ivan F. Boesky and related companies, alleging that the arbitrager misled them in the organization of his $1 billion investment partnership in 1986. 

   And the lawsuit names a major law firm, for the first time, as a defendant in the volume of litigation growing out of the Wall Street insider-trading scandal. 
The suit seeks damages from New York attorney Stephen Fraidin, as well as his law firm, Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson, alleging he and the firm suggested that some of the Boesky partners invest in the venture, called Ivan F. Boesky &amp; Co. L.P. 
It alleges the partnership documents prepared by Fried Frank, a firm that regularly represented Mr. Boesky, were misleading. 

   The suit also names the New York-based financial services concern of Seligmann Harris &amp; Co., which it says helped secure investors in the venture, and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., New York, investment banker for the Boesky partnership. 

   Two other defendants are two men who have pleaded guilty in the insider-trading scandal, Dennis Levine and Martin A. Siegel. 
The former investment bankers have said they provided inside information on pending mergers and acquisitions to Mr. Boesky, who has agreed to plead guilty to a felony charge related to his insider trading. 

   Filed Friday in federal court in Manhattan, the lawsuit alleges that the plaintiffs were misled because the documents failed to disclose, among other things, the criminal violations to which Mr. Boesky later agreed to plead guilty. 

   The suit also says the prospectus failed to disclose certain financial interests of Drexel in the partnership, and declared that Mr. Boesky and his family failed, as promised, to invest at least $20 million in the partnership. 
The suit also alleges the defendants should have registered the partnership offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

   At Fried Frank, a major New York law firm that rarely finds itself on either end of a lawsuit, co-chairman Leon Silverman said, "the inclusion of our law firm and one of our partners in the lawsuit is irresponsible. 

   "The suit lacks any merit whatever," added Mr. Silverman, speaking for the firm and for Mr. Fraidin. 
"Indeed, it is revealing that plaintiffs' counsel refused the opportunity we offered them to examine the facts before filing their lawsuit. 
We leave it to others to discern the true motivations for including us in this lawsuit, but we intend to defend this litigation and we will win." 

   A Drexel Burnham spokesman said: "Neither Drexel Burnham nor any of its employees participated in any way in the placement of the Boesky limited partnership interests. 
So far as we're concerned, the suit is a frivolous attempt to involve Drexel and is totally without merit." 

   Attorneys for Mr. Boesky declined to comment. 
The lawsuit also seeks restitution or award of unspecified damages from the partnership, Mr. Boesky and related companies. 

   Under a partial dissolution of Mr. Boesky's main arbitrage fund approved by the SEC last week, limited partners stand to recoup about $278 million of their original $338 million investment. 
Debenture holders who provided an additional $660 million to Mr. Boesky's approximately $1 billion fund already have been repaid. 
In effect, the lawsuit is seeking to recover the rest of the limited partners' original investment in the partnership, which has been spent in fees and lost through trading activities. 
It isn't clear what other funds the Boesky companies would have available to repay the claims. 

   The lawsuit is filed on behalf of more than 40 plaintiffs, both individuals and companies that had invested with Mr. Boesky, including Lewis Lehrman, who recently was named senior adviser of Morgan Stanley Group Inc.'s asset management unit; and Martin Peretz, editor in chief and chairman of New Republic magazine; a number of institutional investors; and several insurance companies, including Home Insurance Co., a subsidiary of Newark, Del.-based Home Group Inc.; and Lincoln National Life Insurance Co., a unit of Lincoln National Corp., Fort Wayne, Ind.; and several British investors. 

   One institutional plaintiff claimed in the suit that its officials asked Mr. Boesky directly whether his claims of "superior information and knowledge" were based on "inside" information. 
"Boesky stated unequivocally that he did not use 'inside information' and that, if he had used 'inside' information, he would be in jail," the petition declared. 

   Home Insurance Co. alleged that it originally declined to invest in the partnership because it didn't know Mr. Boesky, but that in June 1986, Mr. Fraidin suggested to Home that "the opportunity to invest with Boesky was a good deal that should not be passed up," and he "vouched for Boesky's skill and integrity."

<HL> AT&amp;T Olson Says Cash Flow So Far
This Year is Ahead of Company's Plan

   James E. Olson, chairman of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., told analysts here that the company's cash flow for the first two months of 1987 was above budget and that he is "very pleased" with cost-cutting efforts by line managers. 

   Mr. Olson wouldn't comment on whether the company's profit for the first two months was ahead of budget. 
Since becoming chairman last September, Mr. Olson has made improving profit at the giant telecommunications concern a top priority; he said he wants the company's return-on-equity to reach at least 20%, nearly double what it was in 1985. 

   Last year, AT&amp;T took a $3.2 billion write-off to account for job cuts, facility consolidations and inventory write-downs, resulting in 1986 earnings of only $139 million, or five cents a share, on revenue of $34.1 billion. 
Because of such write-offs, AT&amp;T's return on equity was only 0.3%. 

   The job cuts and other moves will save AT&amp;T $1 billion this year and $1.4 billion next year, Mr. Olson said, but the New York-based company has warned analysts that those savings won't necessarily translate into earnings increases. 

   Mr. Olson also said he "couldn't believe it's going to take" as long as two years for the Federal Communications Commission to remove its cap on profit from AT&amp;T's long-distance business. 

   That cap, which allows the company to earn 12.2% on its more than $9 billion of interstate long-distance equipment, is one factor depressing AT&amp;T's earnings. 
Competitors have recently supported the company's efforts to get regulation removed. 
"Frankly, it will be better for everyone, including our competitors," if AT&amp;T is de-regulated, Mr. Olson said. 

   The executive also said the company's "data networking" strategy doesn't necessarily encompass a specific set of products and services, but is rather an approach to selling products and services to customers. 

   For example, he said, AT&amp;T is developing a world-wide computer and phone network for Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. that can identify when and where phone lines are down. 
Similarly, AT&amp;T is testing with American Express Co. a credit card collection system that automatically dials customers, shows that the call has been answered, then transfers the call with a screen of account information to an agent. 

   Mr. Olson also said that Vittorio Cassoni, the AT&amp;T senior vice president in charge of computer and local area network products that are part of this data networking concept, plans to make his division, Data Systems, profitable within the next two years. 
"I think that's a very good target," Mr. Olson said, adding the profitability from the data networking strategy "is in our five-year business plan." 

   Mr. Olson also acknowledged that to execute the company's data networking ideas, "we do need to spend more time and money training our sales force" on how to analyze customer's data processing needs. 
"We haven't been as good as we could have" in training salespeople on data processing products, he said. 
Analysts have citied the lack of a well-trained computer sales force as one reason for AT&amp;T's troubles in that business.

Sharp Cutback
In Financing

Some Banks Could Remove
Up to $3 Billion in Credit
After March 31 Due Date

<TEXT>
   Brazil's short-term financing from foreign banks could soon be cut by as much as $3 billion, according to bankers in the U.S. and Brazil. 

   Such a cut could severely damage Brazil's trade-related businesses and make a solution to the country's debt crisis much more difficult to achieve. 

   Brazil's central bank governor, Francisco Gros, met yesterday in Miami with his country's main creditor banks to try to resolve looming problems with money-market deposits and trade financing, but there was no indication of any concrete progress. 
About $10 billion of trade credits and $5 billion of money-market deposits fall due March 31. 

   Brazil froze these credits late in February, shortly after suspending interest payments on $67 billion of its longer-term debt to foreign banks. 
The country wants to ensure that lenders won't withdraw these short-term credits, which are essential to the smooth running of its foreign trade. 

   But before yesterday's meeting, bankers in the U.S. and Brazil predicted that some of the short-term financing will be withdrawn. 
Sergio de Freitas, vice president for international affairs at Brazil's Banco Itau, said he expected a cut of "at most 10%" in the $15 billion of credits. 
Some U.S. bankers and economists, and many other Brazilian bankers, believe the cutback could reach 20%, or $3 billion. 

   Following yesterday's meeting, Mr. Gros said: "We made some comments on the current Brazilian situation and what's been happening in Brazil with economic policy." 
Asked how Brazil's major bankers had reacted to his presentation, Mr. Gros said: "Their reaction was one of disappointment, which is quite understandable. 
No one is particularly happy about the situation." 

   He said that he and the banks had agreed to work on a telex message over the next couple of days that will be sent to all of Brazil's foreign creditor banks, explaining the current situation and the need for their continued support. 
The telex will detail what Mr. Gros termed recent measures taken to stabilize the Brazilian economy. 

   But a banker who attended the meeting with Mr. Gros said that "he didn't really have much new to say. 
There's nothing he can say." 
The banker was skeptical about the economic progress promised by Mr. Gros. 

   Mr. Gros said that further meetings aren't scheduled with the creditor banks during his current visit to Miami, but that he will be available to talk to the bankers until he leaves the city tomorrow evening. 

   Brazil also asked its creditor banks for a three-month postponement of the $9.6 billion payment of debt principal due April 16, Mr. Gros said. 
This payment already was postponed once, from late 1986. 
But the immediate concern is the short-term credits. 

   Prior to their meeting with Mr. Gros, officials of the country's major creditor banks said they were particularly concerned about foreign banks that have only lent money-market deposits to Brazil. 
These lenders don't have "much of a stake in the country," said a senior U.S. banker, and therefore might quickly bring legal action if Brazil tried to prevent them from withdrawing their money. 
Any such legal actions could quickly snowball, further complicating efforts to resolve the country's debt crisis. 

   Yesterday was the first time Mr. Gros met with the full committee of the country's major creditor banks since Brazil suspended interest payments on its $67 billion of medium-term and long-term debt to foreign banks on Feb. 20. 
He was somewhat conciliatory yesterday, stressing Brazil's willingness to start paying interest again, provided there can be "an arrangement that would allow Brazil to grow while servicing its debt." 

   But he also criticized U.S. banks for not reserving adequately against their loans to Brazil and other Latin American countries. 
And he said a reappraisal of the whole debt issue is needed. 

   In this tense climate, major banks say they aren't ready to make up for any withdrawal of short-term credits and deposits by other banks. 
Brazilian and multinational companies therefore are bracing for added difficulties with their import and export businesses, which already have been hampered by the moratorium on debt payments. 

   Import financing has become increasingly difficult to obtain, and maturities have been severely shortened, according to executives. 
Such financing is important because many of Brazil's exports rely on imported materials. 
Most analysts believe smaller Brazilian companies, whose banking relationships are weaker, will have particular financing difficulties. 

   Mr. de Freitas of Banco Itau said that although he expected a drop in short-term credits and deposits, "March 31 is not a date when everything will change. 
The critical point is to know when Brazil will produce an economic policy to generate foreign exchange to pay its interest. 
Until then, it's going to be a war of attrition, a number of small events over a long period."

<HL> Departure of SEC's Shad Isn't Expected
To Alter Agency's Enforcement Stance

   President Reagan's nomination of Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman John Shad to become ambassador to the Netherlands isn't likely to lead to a letup in enforcement or reversal of any deregulatory initiatives. 

   No matter who succeeds Mr. Shad, the agency won't go through a turbulent transition, administration and securities industry officials said. 
"You still have four commissioners who participated in the policy making under John Shad," said former Commissioner A.A. Sommer Jr., a Washington securities lawyer. 
"They're a pretty strong-headed bunch." 

   Over the weekend, several new names emerged as possible contenders to succeed Mr. Shad, as the White House expedited its search for candidates of sufficient stature to take over the agency amid Wall Street's widening insider-trading scandal and the torrid debate over curbing corporate takeovers. 

   The list includes John Phelan, chairman of the New York Stock Exchange; John Whitehead, deputy secretary of state and a former investment banker at Goldman, Sachs & Co.; and New Jersey Rep. Matthew Rinaldo, the ranking Republican member of the House Commerce Committee's finance panel, according to administration sources. 

   White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker met Friday with Robert Tuttle, the personnel director, to discuss several presidential appointments, including the SEC post. 
"There is not a narrow list yet," a senior White House official said of the SEC job. 

   Mr. Shad's appointment as ambassador to the Netherlands had been rumored for eight months. 
Others previously mentioned as candidates for the top SEC job -- and said to remain in the running -- are Kevin T. Duffy, a federal judge in Manhattan; Roger Birk, former chairman of Merrill Lynch & Co.; Arthur Leavitt Jr., American Stock Exchange chairman; and two SEC commissioners, Edward Fleischman and Charles Cox. 

   President Reagan had wanted Mr. Shad to stay on as chairman, according to administration sources. 
But Mr. Shad, who already has served longer than any of his 21 predecessors, declined, saying he would prefer an ambassadorship or another post. 

   The timing of Mr. Shad's departure is likely to depend on how rapidly the Senate Banking Committee moves to confirm his successor. 
"If they send up the right kind of candidate, with solid credentials and no baggage, I think Congress will act expeditiously," one Senate staff member said. 

   In a statement yesterday, William Proxmire, Senate Banking Committee chairman, spelled out what kind of candidate he has in mind, expressing the hope that the White House will look someplace other than Wall Street for a successor. 

   "At this particular time," the Wisconsin Democrat said, "I think we need someone who will be perceived as having absolutely no conflicts of interest in the administration of the SEC, and someone who is very tough on crime." 

   One candidate said to have such credentials is Judge Duffy, who served as the SEC's New York regional administrator from 1969 until 1972. 

   With Wall Street under a cloud of controversy, few candidates from the securities industry, if any, will be willing to subject themselves to "microscopic analysis" at confirmation hearings, an industry source said. 
Moreover, some candidates may balk at the job because the tenure probably would end in 1988 if a Democrat is elected president. 

   As a result, the White House may yet turn to Mr. Cox, an economist who is second in SEC seniority, or Mr. Fleischman, a former Wall Street securities lawyer, administration sources said. 
Such a move would hardly be unprecedented; 12 commissioners have been so elevated in the commission's 53-year history. 

   The 63-year-old Mr. Shad served beyond the end of his five-year term last June so that he could oversee the blitz against insider trading and shepherd several projects, including the computerization of the SEC's corporate-disclosure filing system. 

   Mr. Shad, former vice chairman of E.F. Hutton Group Inc., made his early mark as an ardent deregulator. 
Since 1981, the SEC has streamlined regulations to eliminate duplicative filings of corporate reports and to facilitate the raising of corporate capital. 
The agency also reached important agreements with Switzerland, Britain, Canada and Japan to cooperate on international cases of securities fraud. 

   Even some friends have chided Mr. Shad for political ineptitude in his dealings with Congress, however. 
And many Democrats have faulted the chairman for taking an essentially neutral stance on tender-offer regulation and letting the marketplace -- and the courts -- correct any perceived abuses. 

   But Mr. Shad's overall performance drew praise. 
"On balance, Shad turned out to be a fine chairman," said Harvey Pitt, former SEC general counsel. 

   "John Shad has been an extraordinarily responsible regulator," said Commissioner Joseph Grundfest. 
"He knows when to act and when to do nothing."

<HL> Dart Group Seeks Access to Information
In Attempt to Buy Supermarkets General

FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE, HOUSEHOLD GOODS, SUPERMARKETS, TOBACCO (FAB)
   Dart Group Corp. stepped up its efforts to acquire Supermarkets General Corp., requesting access to information it said the food retailer is providing to other prospective buyers. 

   In a letter to Supermarkets General's board on Friday, Herbert H. Haft and his son Robert, Dart's chairman and president respectively, asked for a "selling brochure" that they said has been distributed to about 20 prospective buyers of the Woodbridge, N.J.-based food retailer. 

   "We were denied that information," the Hafts said in the letter, "because we would not sign an agreement prohibiting us from making a bid for Supermarkets General without its approval, as well as otherwise limiting our ability to purchase Supermarkets General's shares." 

   The Hafts' refusal to sign the agreement suggests that Landover, Md.-based Dart is contemplating a hostile tender offer if it can't coax Supermarkets General into accepting the $1.62 billion takeover proposal it made two weeks ago. 
In an interview yesterday, Robert Haft declined to comment on that possibility. 

   "We feel that ultimately we'll be the purchaser of the company," he said. 
"They've clearly put the company up for sale." 

   As previously reported, Supermarkets General, in an apparent attempt to resist Dart's unsolicited bid of $41.75 a share, has been weighing its options. 
These include seeking another suitor, taking the company private, buying back some shares and making an acquisition of its own. 
The company has indicated a strong desire to remain independent. 

   Dart has tried to woo Supermarkets General by saying all terms of its offer are negotiable, including the price. 

   In addition, the discount retailer said it didn't intend to increase its stake in Supermarkets General as long as negotiations were progressing. 
Dart currently holds 1.9 million Supermarkets General shares, or less than 5% of the food retailer's common shares outstanding. 

   Mr. Haft said he and his father wrote to the Supermarkets General board "in the hope that the board recognizes that we're currently the only bidder and we should be included in any kind of information or access to management." 

   Robert E. Wunderle, vice president of public affairs for Supermarkets General, said the company has held "discussions in good faith" with the Hafts. 
He added that the company is "disappointed that (the Hafts) have chosen to publicize the contents of a letter filled with half truths and distortions." 
He declined to elaborate. 

   The Hafts' letter is "clearly designed to pressure us into actions that we believe are not in the shareholders' best interests," Mr. Wunderle said. 
"We will not succumb to that pressure, but will continue, as we have previously stated, to explore all possibilities of maximizing shareholder value." 

   Mr. Wunderle added that the company hasn't yet received a report from its investment banker, Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., on the Dart proposal and other possibilities. 

   In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Supermarkets General closed at $42.25, down 12.5 cents, indicating investors hope a higher bid will emerge. 

   Separately, Supermarkets General and certain executives were sued in state court in Delaware by a shareholder, Stanley D. Bernstein, who contends they illegally tried to thwart takeover offers and entrench themselves. 
The plaintiff, who claims to represent a class of injured shareholders, is seeking an order requiring Supermarkets General to negotiate "in good faith with all bidders." 

   In their letter, the Hafts described meetings last week with Supermarkets General's representatives as "not productive." 
They said the Supermarkets General representatives outlined several proposals for payments to that company's executives as part of a transaction. 
These included payments of more than $5.7 million to Leonard Lieberman, the company's chairman and chief executive officer, and two other executives as "an immediate 'cash out' of their severance agreements," according to the letter. 

   Mr. Haft said the implication was that Mr. Lieberman and James Dougherty, the company's executive vice president, plan to leave the company if it is sold. 

   He suggested that the two executives' interests might not reflect shareholders' interests. 
"Every dollar paid to top management above and beyond their present agreements, is a dollar out of the shareholders' pockets," he said. 

   Mr. Haft said the two sides never discussed the price shareholders would receive. 
"They wouldn't tell us whether our price was fair or adequate. 
They did not give us any response to our offer."

Buys Back 7.1% Stake

   Clark Equipment Co. said it bought 1,339,000, or about 7.1%, of its common shares for $26.375 apiece from an investor group it had sued for allegedly scheming to illegally take control of the company. 

   The truck maker said the group agreed not to buy Clark voting stock for 10 years. 

   Clark last week sued Arthur Goldberg, president of International Controls Inc. of Boca Raton, Fla., who led the group, and other group members, charging that they tried to extract "greenmail" from Clark. 
Greenmail occurs when a company buys back an investor's stock at a premium, often under the threat of a takeover. 

   Mr. Goldberg said yesterday that his group sold its shares Friday at the market price on the New York Stock Exchange, and that he understands the shares were purchased by Clark. 

   He said his group initially bought the stock as a "long-term investment," but decided to sell after recent management steps, including the adoption of an anti-takeover provision. 
"People buy shares to make a profit, and we were concerned they were doing things that would undermine that goal," Mr. Goldberg said. 

   In composite trading on the Big Board, Clark common shares closed at $25, down $1.875. 

   Earlier this month Clark adopted a "poison pill" takeover-defense measure and said it planned to buy back as many as three million of its 18.8 million shares in the open market. 
Clark said the purchase of the investor group's shares reduces the number it will buy under the buyback plan.

   Maryland officials said they plan to take possession of $2 million in bearer bonds allegedly owned by Jeffrey A. Levitt, former president of Old Court Savings &amp; Loan Association, and his family in violation of a settlement agreement reached last month. 

   The state on Thursday obtained an order from a state circuit court judge here barring the Levitts from transferring the bonds. 
In addition, the judge ordered the the Levitts to explain no later than next Friday where the bonds are and to turn them over. 
Mr. Levitt is serving a 30-year sentence for embezzling funds from Old Court, a privately insured thrift which collapsed in 1985. 

   However, Paul M. Sandler, an attorney representing Mr. Levitt, said: "My client has assured me that he doesn't have possession, custody or control of the bonds." 
The lawyer said he consented to the state's injunction because "my client can't transfer what he does not have." 
He added that Mr. Levitt will report to the judge, as ordered. 

   Under the terms of the February agreement, the Levitts were supposed to have turned over all but $360,000 of their assets. 
However, a private investigator hired by the state allegedly uncovered that between August 1984 and August 1985, the Levitts received deliveries of about 390 bonds, which weren't accounted for. 

   Peter Gunst, an attorney representing the state, said stops have been put on the bonds. 
He added that numerous banks had advised the state that the coupons hadn't been cashed for the last 18 months. 

   "This is what led us to believe that this is a secret cash hoard," said Mr. Gunst.

Starts to Worry

Sharp Slide Isn't Predicted
But Significant Advance
Is Improbable, They Say

   The British pound, leader of the recent rally in high-yielding currencies, is beginning to look too pricey, some foreign-exchange dealers say. 

   Although sterling isn't headed for a sharp downturn soon, several factors may stymie any significant advances, the dealers maintain. 

   "We don't see a lot of upside potential for sterling from here, but we don't think sterling is about to collapse either," says Geoffrey Dennis, international economist at James Capel &amp; Co., a London broker. 

   Supporting that view is the pound's performance in recent days. 
It reached a high point of $1.6050 in Friday's New York dealings, but couldn't sustain that level. 
And against the bellwether European currency, the pound hasn't been able to break 3.00 West German marks. 

   Other traders, though, remain bullish about sterling's near-term outlook. 
They cite Britain's continued high interest rates, even with the recent declines, its relatively good potential for economic growth and new optimism about the reelection of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party government. 
Mrs. Thatcher's political future is considered enhanced by the fiscal 1988 budget presented last week by her chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, which included tax cuts and reduced need for government borrowing. 

   But politics also figure in the less optimistic outlook for sterling. 
Last week Mr. Lawson said he was "content" with the pound's exchange-rate level but reiterated his opposition to a significant strengthening of the currency. 
A weak currency helps Britain's exporters by making their goods less expensive in world markets. 
So a threat of possible Bank of England intervention against the pound hangs over the market. 

   "Mr. 
Lawson's statement after the budget made it very clear; he doesn't want to see it much higher than this," Mr. Dennis says. 

   Britain's widely expected entry into the European Monetary System poses a longer-term threat to the pound, traders say. 
A devaluation of sterling, possibly to 2.80 marks, would precede Britain's admission to the joint float of eight currencies, many traders believe. 
The Conservative government is believed to favor entry if it survives the next election, which may be called as soon as this summer. 
Entry and sterling's devaluation are "a safe bet," says Ronald H. Holzer, vice president and chief dealer at Harris Trust &amp; Savings Bank in Chicago. 

   Still, Britain's political stability, relatively robust economy and, above all, its still-high interest rates will continue to attract investors to the pound, other traders say. 
Yields on three-month sterling Eurodeposits stood at 9 5/8% Friday, in sharp contrast to 6 3/8% and 3 7/8% for similar dollar and mark deposits, respectively. 
"We're still looking for sterling at $1.65," says Anthony J. Murphy, a Royal Bank of Canada trader in New York. 

   But following the pound's appreciation of more than 3.5% against major currencies this month, "The level right now makes the attraction a lot less," Mr. Holzer says. 
"It's topping." 

   In late New York trading Friday, the pound stood at $1.6042, up from $1.6003 Thursday, but eased to 2.9333 marks, from 2.9338. 

   In other dealings, the dollar edged lower in sparse trading, slipping to 1.8285 marks, from 1.8333, and to 151.35 Japanese yen, from 151.48. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for March delivery rose 30 cents an ounce to $405.60 in moderate trading estimated at 2.2 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $406 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.

<HL> Rostenkowski Leans Toward Increasing
Tax on Gasoline as Step to Pare Deficit

<TEXT>
   House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski is leaning toward proposing a boost in the federal gasoline tax, and against a stock-transaction tax, as part of an effort to narrow the federal deficit. 

   The Illinois Democrat is focusing on the levy in his search for a major revenue raiser to reach a goal set by House Speaker Jim Wright (D., Texas) of finding $18 billion in new revenue. 
Every one-cent rise in the gasoline tax would raise $900 million to $1 billion a year. 

   At the same time, Rep. Rostenkowski said he has rejected for now the speaker's proposal to tax stock transactions. 
In a speech over the weekend, he said there are "a bunch of questions" about such a tax, adding that he doesn't expect answers "by the time the Ways and Means Committee has to act to raise revenues." 

   Rep. Rostenkowski's willingness to make choices about what his tax-writing committee will accept adds to the possibility that the House will enact a tax increase of some kind for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. 
Speaker Wright has said that while he will push to build a consensus among House Democrats to raise taxes about $18 billion a year, he will leave the specifics about how that will be accomplished to Rep. Rostenkowski and the Ways and Means Committee. 

   The tax boost would be part of a $36 billion deficit-reduction package the House Democratic leadership seeks for the coming fiscal year. 
An additional $18 billion would come from spending cuts. 

   President Reagan has vowed to veto any tax increase Congress sends to him. 
But Rep. Wright said yesterday on CBS's "Face the Nation" that the president in fact proposed taxes in his budget, but he labeled them "user fees." 
Rep. Wright acknowledged that Democrats are sensitive to criticism that they are sure to face if taxes are raised. 
"Of course nobody likes to be accused of tax and spend, but it's more honest than borrow and spend," Rep. Wright said. 

   The Ways and Means chairman has zeroed in on the gasoline tax almost by default. 
He is committed not to change the tax rates passed in last year's sweeping tax bill, despite Rep. Wright's proposal to freeze the top individual tax rate at 38.5% rather than allowing it to fall to 28% next year, as scheduled. 
And Rep. Rostenkowski won't advocate any increases from Social Security or unemployment taxes. 

   While the Ways and Means chairman has suggested that revenue could be raised by increasing the excise tax on cigarettes, beer and distilled spirits, a boost in the "sin taxes" alone won't raise the amount of revenue the Democratic leaders seek. 

   Rep. Rostenkowski also is attracted to the idea of raising the gasoline tax because such an action wouldn't be solely a revenue-driven exercise. 
Raising the gas tax could be justified as a means of strengthening the domestic oil industry and reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil. 

   But passage of a higher tax on gasoline won't be easy because lawmakers from rural southwestern states are likely to fight such an effort. 
And last week, the chief Senate tax writer, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D, Texas), said he wasn't ready to endorse a gasolinetax boost. 

   In rejecting a stock-transfer tax, Rep. Rostenkowski told the Futures Industry Association in Boca Raton, Fla., on Saturday, "The fact that many people don't like what's happening in the financial markets doesn't mean that they're going to be hit with a new tax." 

   Rep. Rostenkowski raised several concerns about Rep. Wright's recent proposal to impose a transfer tax of perhaps 0.5% on both buyers and sellers of publicly traded stock. 
He said that Congress should consider whether such a tax would "destroy the liquidity of the markets by discouraging transactions where the profit per unit is so small that it would be totally eclipsed by the tax." 

   He added that another concern was whether such a tax "would weaken our international competitiveness" since "financial instruments are an important part of international trade." 
He also voiced worries that markets might move offshore to avoid the tax. 

   Before a transfer tax can be seriously considered, the Ways and Means chairman said, several issues must be resolved -- including whether people who take losses would be taxed the same as those with gains, what markets would be affected and whether options would be included. 

   "Once new ideas like the transaction tax are raised, they often become the focus of discussions that go on for years before any action is taken," Rep. Rostenkowski concluded. 

   Referring to the idea of extending and expanding the tax credit for research and development, Rep. Rostenkowski said, "The tax writers see no urgency there and are put off by the fact that it would cost billions." 
Some lawmakers have been suggesting extending and enlarging the credit as part of a push to restore U.S. competitiveness. 

   Despite the search for additional revenue to meet budget-deficit targets, Rep. Rostenkowski said he "strongly opposes" a value-added tax. 
A value-added tax is a kind of national sales tax imposed at each level of the chain of distribution. 
The Ways and Means Committee doesn't "have the energy or appetite to endorse a radical new tax like a VAT," he added.

Volkswagen Stock Shows Unusual Resilience
In Light of Its Currency Exchange Scandal

   A currency scandal at Volkswagen has dented the company's standing with many investors. 
So why has the West German auto maker's stock held up so well after an initial, brief decline? 

   Europe is abuzz with speculation that a big German bank, probably Deutsche Bank, may be purchasing VW shares to support their price. 
A VW spokesman says he's heard the talk but has "no indication that a friendly bank is helping out." 
Deutsche Bank, which has close ties to VW, says it's company policy not to comment on stock market rumors. 

   The resilience of VW stock strikes some people as unusual in light of all the unanswered questions about the currency affair. 
Few details have emerged, leaving investors wondering whether there is more bad news to come. 

   VW stock initially dropped 7% in Frankfurt after the company on March 10 announced that it lost as much as $259 million through falsified foreign exchange contracts. 
The sum is equal to 80% of VW's net income for 1985, a bumper year. 
The company said it will make provisions from reserves to cover the loss. 

   The stock stabilized within 24 hours and since then has climbed about 3% while the German stock market fell almost 5%. 
"I'm very surprised VW hasn't fallen further," says Jens Erhardt, who publishes a German market newsletter. 
The shares trade only on European exchanges, though orders can be placed through some U.S. brokers. 

   "On fundamentals, I think the company is doing okay," says Stephen Reitman, an analyst at Phillips &amp; Drew in London, "but we're telling people to temper any enthusiasm at the moment and wait until things are a bit clearer." 

   The stock does have a few fans. 
"It's a clear buy," contends Gabriel Marcus, president of the New York securities unit of DG Bank of West Germany. 
But he warns that VW might face lawsuits in connection with an issue of its stock last fall. 

   Many German stocks have started to look inexpensive as the Frankfurt market slid in recent weeks, reflecting a retreat by foreign investors worried about the German economy. 
Even such favorites as Siemens and Daimler-Benz have been pummeled. 

   German banks and other institutions occasionally support stocks -- particularly new issues that run into difficulty -- without declaring publicly what they are doing. 
While such undisclosed activity might be illegal in a U.S. market, securities lawyers say, it is legal in Germany. 

   VW's main bank is Deutsche Bank, whose chairman, F. Wilhelm Christians, has a prominent position on the auto maker's supervisory board. 
The bank managed an issue of VW stock last September, offering nonvoting shares at about 6% above their current trading level and at the same time issuing a strong buy recommendation. 

   In November VW denied a newsletter report that it had incurred a massive currency loss. 
Mr. Erhardt says stockholders won't be thrilled if it emerges that VW or Deutsche Bank could have found out about the currency fraud before the stock issue. 

   When the Bonn government eventually sells its 16% stake in VW, a move originally planned for this year but delayed by the foreign exchange affair, Deutsche Bank is a leading candidate to manage the transaction. 
If Deutsche Bank is supporting the VW stock price, "maybe they're pitching for business" from the government, suggests one Frankfurt banker. 

   The currency mess has aggravated stock buyers' worries about VW's prospects in export markets. 
In 11 months, VW shares have been halved to $181 from a high of $375. 
"It's going to take them a while to get back their credibility," says Rosemary Sagar of Drexel Burnham Lambert. 

   While VW is holding on to its position as market leader in Europe, largely because of its best-selling Golf model, the mark's recent rise against the dollar and other currencies is cutting deeply into profit margins. 
VW's Audi subsidiary, in the past the strongest earner in the group, has estimated that its profit for 1986 was halved by the falling dollar and technical troubles with its Audi 5000 model in the U.S. 
A recent joint venture between VW and Ford Motor in South America hasn't yet had an impact on the German company's troubled Brazilian subsidiary, a big drain on profit in recent years. 
The unit has said that its net loss tripled last year to $145.5 million. 
And in Germany, VW's stronghold, the company faces growing Japanese competition in a market that analysts say could shrink slightly this year after its recent strong growth. 

   Even after the foreign exchange debacle, VW's policy is not to hedge against currency fluctuations. 
The company claims it doesn't need to cover itself since the fluctuations balance each other out in the medium term. 
That stance is "just poor management," says Dagmar Bottenbruch, a First Boston analyst in New York.

   Federal regulators have been quietly trying for several months to find a buyer for Financial Corp. of America, parent of the nation's largest thrift institution, but the prospects aren't good for a sale any time in the immediate future, thrift industry sources said. 

   Several industry sources said that Edwin J. Gray, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, would like to find a buyer for the American Savings &amp; Loan Association unit of Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. before he leaves office at the end of June. 

   National Thrift News, an industry publication, quoted unidentified sources in Washington as saying that the sale of Financial Corp. was a "top priority" for federal regulators. 
A bank board spokesman declined to comment. 

   "Ed would like to resolve the situation one way or another before he leaves office, but I'm not sure there's enough time to do that," said one top California thrift executive. 

   The word of Mr. Gray's intentions comes at a time when criticism of Financial Corp. and its chairman, William Popejoy, has been growing in California thrift circles. 
Mr. Popejoy, who couldn't be reached for immediate comment, was brought into Financial Corp. in August 1984 after regulators forced out then-chairman Charles Knapp during a run on deposits and effectively assumed a supervisory role over the thrift. 

   After initially cutting the size of Financial Corp., Mr. Popejoy has been pushing its growth again with the permission of federal regulators. 
American Savings has generally been paying somewhat more for deposits and charging less for mortgages than its major healthy main competitors. 
It also has kept making more fixed-rate mortgage loans than the industry average, gambling that interest rates won't rise precipitously over the next several years. 
Mr. Popejoy has insisted that he isn't taking many risks because his loans have been hedged to some degree against possible interest rate increases. 

   Mr. Gray has said previously that any attempt by regulators to actually take over Financial Corp. three years ago would have led to the bankruptcy of the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corp., which couldn't afford a multi-billion dollar bailout. 
However, he has been pushing Congress for an infusion of as much as $25 billion of capital into the insurance fund despite industry insistence that a much smaller amount is needed. 

   "I think Gray is trying to win over the large thrifts, who oppose his FSLIC recapitalization plan, by implying that he would take a problem Financial Corp. off their hands if he had FSLIC money to aid in a takeover," one California thrift executive said. 

   However, a thrift attorney, who said he has been hearing rumors about a government-aided attempt to have Financial Corp. taken over, estimated that such a move would require a buyer to add about $600 million to Financial Corp.'s net worth to get it to meet minimum regulatory requirements. 
The attorney also said he believed a takeover could eventually cost FSLIC as much as $7 billion. 
The Home Loan Bank Board has said the fund had reserves of $1.9 billion on Dec. 31, but a preliminary General Accounting Office audit claimed FSLIC ended the year technically bankrupt. 

   In the past, Mr. Popejoy has said he would welcome discussions about a possible acquisition of Financial Corp. or some sort of outside capital infusion. 

   In recent weeks, as sniping by other thrift industry executives has increased, Mr. Popejoy has been attempting to explain his rationale for increasing the size of Financial Corp. and his strategy for hedging possible risks. 
Two weeks ago he sought and received a legal opinion that he could spell out that strategy at a meeting of industry executives without causing antitrust problems, industry sources said. 

   Mr. Popejoy spoke before some of his top competitors after a meeting of the legislative and regulatory committee of the California League of Savings Institutions. 
Under the ground rules, those in the audience couldn't ask questions or comment on Mr. Popejoy's talk, and the chairman of at least one major thrift left prior to the speech.

   After seeming to contradict Vice President George Bush last week, President Reagan issued a clarification, acknowledging that Mr. Bush expressed reservations about the Iran policy as it was unfolding. 

   The issue is important for Mr. Bush, who as the leading contender for the GOP presidential nomination is walking a political tightrope, trying to distance himself from the Iran scandal while remaining a team player with Mr. Reagan. 

   On a campaign trip to Michigan, Mr. Bush made headlines Feb. 12 when he said he "expressed certain reservations" to "key players" in the administration as the Iran policy developed. 
Mr. Reagan appeared to undercut that at his news conference Thursday night. 
When asked if Mr. Bush had objected to the policy as Secretary of State George Shultz and Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger had, Mr. Reagan said, "no." 

   Marlin Fitzwater, who was Mr. Bush's press secretary until recently becoming Mr. Reagan's chief spokesman, later asked the president about the apparent discrepancy. 
Mr. Fitzwater told reporters Friday that Messrs. 
Reagan and Bush discussed the issue at their regular daily meeting that morning. 
"The president told me simply that the vice president did express reservations to him, but always supported the policy and the decisions," Mr. Fitzwater said.

Business as Usual: Economists Disagree
About Current Strength, What's Ahead

   Economists frequently joke that they can predict anything but the future. 
Lately, though, they are having just as much trouble with the present. 

   Although this year's first quarter ends a week from tomorrow, there is widespread disagreement over just how strong or weak it has been. 
There is even more disagreement over the second-quarter outlook and what the implications are for interest rates, the stock market and the currency markets. 

   According to the average estimate of a dozen analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal, the economy is growing at a moderate 3% annual rate this quarter, after adjusting for inflation, and will expand at a 2.8% pace during the next three months. 
That would be an improvement from the anemic 1.1% pace in last year's fourth quarter. 
But much of the current quarter's strength came from inventory rebuilding, the analysts say, and the economy's overall tone remains sluggish at best. 

   If so, that could disappoint investors who are counting on surging corporate profits to fuel additional gains in the stock market. 
Despite the stronger overall growth expected in this year's first half, many analysts say consumer spending is likely to be unenergetic. 

   Moreover, the dollar's drop in the foreign-exchange markets and a surge in oil prices have made many bond market investors more leery of the inflation outlook. 
Although the dollar has stabilized recently, many money managers remain bearish on the U.S. currency, partly because of skepticism about whether the recent monetary pact between the U.S. and five of its leading trading partners will work for long. 
Also, most analysts in the Journal's survey predict it will take a long time to make any meaningful progress in whittling the huge U.S. trade deficit. 

   The Commerce Department's initial estimate of first-quarter growth won't be released until April 23. 
The department used to release an initial, or "flash," estimate of quarterly growth in the final month of each quarter but abandoned that last year because it believed the figures often were misleading. 

   One of the few things many analysts agree on is that interpreting economic reports lately has been especially difficult because of the tax law that became effective Jan. 1. 
But few analysts agree on how much effect the law has had. 

   Only three months ago, the conventional wisdom was that the economy would be so weak early this year, partly because of the new tax law, that the Federal Reserve System would feel obliged to cut interest rates in an effort to avert a recession. 
Now, analysts say, the prospect of higher inflation and somewhat stronger economic growth could mean that the Fed's next move will be to tighten credit conditions to remind investors of its determination to keep inflation in check. 

   Yet individual estimates vary enormously. 
At one extreme, David Levine of Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. insists that a "boom" already is under way and that business activity will accelerate during the rest of the year, leading to much higher interest rates. 
He contends that the economy will accelerate so rapidly that the Federal Reserve will tighten credit conditions by mid-May, and that interest rates will surge about three percentage points by year's end. 

   But A. Gary Shilling, an economic consultant, argues that the economy hardly is growing at all this quarter. 
John D. Paulus of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. forecasts even slower growth next quarter, with interest rates dropping a full percentage point during the next three to six months. 
Mr. Paulus and several other analysts also expect weak growth in many other leading industrial nations, a development they say will increase pressure for lower world-wide borrowing costs. 

   Confronted by such diverse views and by a morass of contradictory government economic reports, many investment managers say they are waiting to make any major strategy changes until clearer signals of the economy's health emerge. 
Meanwhile, bond prices have hardly budged in the past few months, reminding traders of the monotonous 1960s and early 1970s. 

   If there is a majority view right now, it seems to be that the economy and interest rates will be trendless for at least another month or two. 
"Rates probably will stay as is, with a greater chance they could move down a little than move up," says Robert Chandross, chief economist of Lloyds Bank in New York. 

   Mr. Chandross and many other analysts weren't too impressed by the recent monetary accord between the U.S., Canada, Japan, Britain, West Germany and France. 
That was "one of the great nonmeetings of all time," Mr. Chandross says. 
"There was nothing earth-shattering in there, no hard, concrete agreements." 

   Inflation appears likely to accelerate this year, according to most analysts in the Journal's survey. 
According to the average estimate among the dozen economists, prices -- as measured by a gauge based on the gross national product known as the deflator -- rose at a 3.2% annual rate in the first quarter and will increase at a 3.3% rate in the second quarter. 
In 1986's final quarter, the deflator rose only 0.7%. 

   Mr. Levine continues to be optimistic about the economic outlook, even though he has been predicting a big boom and higher interest rates for more than a year now. 
At a recent conference, Mr. Levine acknowledged that his forecast was way off target, quipping that "it's been a little like leaving the landing lights on for Amelia Earhart." 
Now, though, he says, "I think the wait finally is over. 
It's unnerving that nobody else thinks so, but I think the evidence finally is pointing in that direction."

   Friday's Bond Activity
   Most interest prices wound up little changed once again in light trading volume. 
The federal funds rate, the rate on reserves that banks lend each other overnight, averaged about 6.10%, according to Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) 
Inc. 
That compared with Thursday's average of 6.06%. 

   The rate on the Treasury's latest three-month bills inched higher to 5.51% bid from 5.50% Thursday. 
The rate on the Treasury's latest six-month bills climbed to 5.55% bid from 5.51%. 

   In the bond market, the Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 fell slightly to 99 24/ 32 from 99 27/32 Thursday, while the yield edged up to 7.52% from 7.51%. 
The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 finished unchanged at 100 9/32 to yield 7.21%. 

   Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds fell 2.91 points to close at 1424.73, a decline of about three points from the previous Friday. 
It hovered last Friday between 1424.33 and 1429.50.

   Trans World Airlines said it agreed to halt temporarily the purchase of USAir Group Inc. shares. 

   In a stipulation entered in federal court in Pittsburgh, TWA is barred from acquiring any more USAir stock prior to April 23, and must give Washington-based USAir at least 14 days notice of future stock purchases. 
TWA also agreed that it would not "knowingly or willfully interfere in any way" with the proposed merger between USAir and Winston-Salem, N.C.-based Piedmont Aviation Inc. 

   The stipulation supersedes a temporary restraining order in effect that banned TWA from buying USAir shares until today. 

   The action follows TWA's Securities and Exchange Commission filing last Monday in which it stated that it didn't intend to seek control of USAir or to acquire additional USAir shares "at this time." 
TWA, which currently holds a 14.8% stake in USAir and proposed recently to buy the carrier's remaining shares for $52 each, also sought in the filing "the flexibility" to increase its holdings to as much as 25% of USAir's stock. 

   The court said that TWA is free "to make any filings" with respect to its pending lawsuit in a Delaware court seeking to overturn USAir's anti-takeover measures.

New Jefferies Chief Shows Low-Key Style

<TEXT>
   Frank E. Baxter comes from a tiny California town that bears his family's name. 
Now he faces the challenge of running a big-time brokerage firm that carries the name and mark of another man. 

   Last week, the 50-year-old president of Jefferies Group Inc. was given the post of chief executive officer after the stunning resignation of the firm's founder, chairman and chief executive, Boyd Jefferies. 
In the latest chapter of the insider-trading scandal, Mr. Jefferies, 56, agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts of violating securities laws. 
No one else in the firm was implicated. 

   The new chief executive is in some respects a sharp contrast to the charismatic and driven Mr. Jefferies, who, according to one Wall Street source, "would chase stock trades all night." 

   Mr. Baxter says he doesn't plan to do any trading as chief executive. 
He says that is partly to ensure that every trader will have one higher official reviewing his or her work -- a check that was missing in the case of Mr. Jefferies. 

   Plus, he says he doesn't aspire to the same kind of prominence that Mr. Jefferies had in the securities business. 
"I am a more collegial person. 
I need to share authority," says Mr. Baxter, a trim six-footer, who joined Jefferies in 1974. 

   "I've never thought of Frank as being an aggressive personality. 
He is a nice guy, who you enjoy being with," says Donald Weedon, chief executive officer of Weedon &amp; Co., a New York brokerage firm. 

   Mr. Baxter went into the securities business thanks partly to the military. 
He says that while growing up in northern California he dreamed of becoming a lawyer. 
"As a kid, I sat around law offices and read law books," he says. (His family moved when he was very young from Baxter, which Mr. Baxter's great grandfather established as a stagecoach stop during the Gold Rush and which apparently hasn't grown much since.) 

   But as a teenager, he enlisted in the Air Force. 
"On guard duty one day, I saw another soldier reading The Wall Street Journal and asked if I could see it," recalls Mr. Baxter. 
It turned out the other young man -- who remains a friend -- was already playing in the stock market and got Mr. Baxter interested. 
"He even helped me get a summer job at a brokerage firm," Mr. Baxter says. 

   Mr. Baxter didn't like retail brokerage work. 
"I didn't like trying to sell people. 
There was a little too much promotion involved," he says. 

   After graduating in 1961 from the University of California, Berkeley, with a Bachelor's degree in economics, Mr. Baxter soon went to work for a San Francisco brokerage firm that was involved in the "third market," where listed stocks are traded off the exchange, usually in transactions between institutions. 

   Interest in that market eventually brought him to Jefferies. 
Mr. Jefferies is viewed as a pioneer in building the third market. 
Jefferies accounts for about 60% of third-market trading. 
This market has been growing in recent years thanks partly to the wave of corporate takeovers, where the third market's ability to execute fast, discreet trades of big blocks of stock is particularly useful. 

   Though Mr. Baxter, like other officials of the firm, lived in the shadow of the founder, he did have successes of his own, observers say. 
In 1985, he opened an office for Jefferies in London. 
"It opened Feb. 10 and by April it was in the black. 
I thought that was fantastic," says Benjamin L. Lubin, a securities consultant and an outside director for Jefferies. 

   Mr. Baxter also deserves much of the credit for holding down the firm's costs during a period of rapid growth in recent years, says Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst with Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. in New York. 
"Though Boyd generated a great deal of business, you make your profits by controlling costs," says Mr. Long. 

   Mr. Baxter says he plans to rely heavily on the 445 employees that make up the Jefferies "team" -- a concept that seems to pervade the firm. 
The firm's colors -- maroon and gold -- and its symbol -- a lion -- adorn coffee mugs and the firm's banner, as well as warm-up jackets, which are hung over the backs of many traders' chairs. 

   The firm also has its own song, which begins "Jefferies Group, the elite team . . . . 
" Mr. Baxter says it's sometimes played in the trading room when a particularly good deal is done. 

   Mr. Baxter says he is banking on team spirit to help keep traders from leaving now that Mr. Jefferies, whom he describes as the firm's "spiritual leader" is gone. 
"Even if they aren't loyal to me, I think they will be loyal to each other," he says. 

   Morale is high, he said. 
After Mr. Jefferies made the announcement of his resignation, there was "stunned silence and some tears." 
But then, Mr. Baxter adds, "the team just rose to the occasion. 
I've never seen morale higher." 

   Nevertheless, he has taken some quick steps to reassure people and assert his new position. 
He held a meeting in Dallas over the weekend to review what he termed "my philosophy and our business plan." 
He says he planned to invite 30 employees of the firm, but got such a response that about 70 went, many paying their own airfare. 

   As president, Mr. Baxter says, he was deeply involved in forming the firm's business strategy, and doesn't see any need to change it. 
"Institutional brokerage is going to remain the engine that drives the firm," he says. 

   But the firm will continue diversifying. 
Recently it has moved into such areas as trading convertible debentures and stocks of foreign companies. 
It is still looking to open an office in Asia, probably Tokyo, by the end of the year. 

   Nor does he believe Mr. Jefferies's transgressions will do lasting damage to the firm. 
"Both incidents involved trading positions that were all done by Boyd," he says. 
Mr. Jefferies was charged with manipulating the price of a stock and with helping arbitrager Ivan Boesky hide his ownership of certain stocks by having Jefferies temporarily take ownership. 

   But it may be some time before Jefferies stops hearing the kind of joke one Wall Street wag offered Friday: "Jefferies's motto is: Why buy a stock when you can rent it."

   A spokesman declined to say whether the board approved a buyback at its meeting Friday, and Mr. Panic couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Mr. Panic said at the annual meeting that the company had about $500 million in cash, and total resources of about $2 billion, to pursue its previously announced strategy of acquiring a major drug company. 
He said he believed the acquisition could be accomplished through a friendly bid for some company during the next 24 months. 

   As previously reported, ICN last January asked the Food and Drug Administration to allow expanded use of its drug ribavirin by some patients who have been exposed to acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

<HL> U.K. Economy Grew 0.3%
In Fourth Quarter of 1986

   The Central Statistical Office, in an upward revision of a preliminary report, said Britain's economy grew 0.3% in 1986's fourth quarter from the prior three months. 
In February, the office had reported no fourth-quarter growth. 

   The quarterly growth was measured by using output-based gross domestic product, considered the most reliable indicator of short-term movements in the economy. 

   The government also announced that the average estimate of British GDP showed a 2.6% increase for all of 1986, slower than 1985's 3.4% expansion. 
The estimate is an average of the output-based, income-based and expenditure-based measures of GDP, and is considered the most accurate gauge of the United Kingdom's long-term economic movements.

Takeover by Firm There, Sources Say

   Three years ago, pundits touted Micron Technology Inc. as the kind of small American company that can beat the Japanese at their own game: low-cost production of high-tech products. 
Later, when Micron began to run up big losses because of Japanese price competition in semiconductor sales, it became one of U.S. industry's most strident critics of Japanese trade practices. 

   Now, however, executives at several Japanese chip companies say that Micron has been secretly exploring the possibility of being acquired by a Japanese company. 
The executives say representatives of Micron, a Boise, Idaho-based chip manufacturer, held talks last year with at least three Japanese companies, Fujitsu Ltd., Hitachi Ltd. and Oki Electric Industry Co., on the subject of a possible purchase of Micron by one of the Japanese concerns. 
These companies declined to comment on the talks. 

   Joseph Parkinson, Micron's chairman, denied that he had ever spoken to a Japanese company about a possible takeover, and called reports that Micron has sought a Japanese suitor "utter baloney." 
"You can check my passport," he said, when asked to comment on a report that he flew to Tokyo last summer for talks with a possible acquirer. 
However, Mr. Parkinson declined to comment on whether overtures may have been made on Micron's behalf by the company's investment bankers. 

   According to the Japanese industry sources, Micron representatives held talks with Fujitsu, Hitachi and Oki in Tokyo last summer. 
The discussions were said to have covered a number of issues, including possible technology-licensing agreements and a potential sale of Micron's assets. 
The executives said Hitachi dismissed Micron's overtures immediately, and Fujitsu likewise didn't pursue Micron overtures. 

   Oki, meanwhile, the object of Micron's latest anti-Japanese attack just last week, sent a vice president to Boise within the past six months to meet with Micron's president, Juan Benitez. 
Mr. Parkinson acknowledges that the Oki executive visited Micron, but denies that the subject of a Micron buyout was seriously discussed. 
"The subject didn't come up," he said. 

   Micron, started eight years ago with Idaho potato money on a plot of sand and sagebrush in Boise, has blamed most of its losses over the past two years on Japanese dumping -- selling goods below their production cost. 
The Japanese agreed in a trade accord signed last summer to open their markets and refrain from chip dumping, but Micron and other chip makers accuse the Japanese of violating the accord, and Micron's losses have only widened. 
In the company's fiscal second quarter, ended March 5, Micron posted a loss of $10.9 million, compared with a $9.8 million loss in the year-earlier period. 
Revenue for the quarter totaled $20.1 million, up from $9.4 million a year earlier. 

   Because of Micron's recent overtures, individuals close to Oki say Oki executives were particularly shocked when Micron last week produced an Oki invoice from a recent chip sale in Hong Kong as evidence of its dumping claims. 
Micron used the occasion to call on the U.S. government to retaliate against Japanese producers "before it's too late." 
"The Japanese response to our administration's good-faith efforts to solve this illegal dumping has been noncompliance and a publicity blitz of denials and statements to confuse and weaken our resolve," Mr. Parkinson said. 

   Micron's steady losses have caused some industry analysts to conclude that the company isn't a long-term survivor, although its officials say it will rebound when it starts production of a new one-megabyte memory chip. 
Its current problems stand in stark contrast to its initial success as a promising high-tech startup. 

   That success led author George Gilder, in his 1984 book, The Spirit of Enterprise, to rhapsodize that Micron "shows once again that the crucial capital of industry is not money or machinery, but mind and spirit, and that America -- in these crucial domains of enterprise -- remains No. 1."

   As Taiwan's foreign-currency reserves soar, the country is increasingly being viewed as an alternative to Asian borrowers' dependence on Japanese banks, according to bankers. 
But most of Tawain's major banks late last week passed up an opportunity to play a major role in the international loan market. 

   Chase Manhattan Bank failed to syndicate a loan here for Pertamina, Indonesia's state-owned oil company, as six out of at least eight major Taiwan banks rejected the loan. 
Pertamina is seeking about $470 million to finance the construction of a liquefied-natural-gas plant, and Chase had hoped to raise at least $240 million of that in Taiwan. 

   "The idea was too new, and there was too little time for them to digest" the loan proposal, said William Liley, managing director of Chase Manhattan Asia Ltd.'s project-financing division in Hong Kong. 
Bankers were given only a month to review the loan proposal. 

   The major stumbling blocks were inexperience and conservatism. 
Bankers who declined to support the loan said they have little expertise in project financing and much less in assessing energy markets or Indonesia's credit-worthiness. 
The bankers' conservatism, meanwhile, is based partly on the fact that all major Taiwan banks are either owned or controlled by the government. 

   "It's difficult for us to try something new, because we're likely to be penalized for losing the public money but unlikely to be rewarded if we make money for the bank," said one banker. 

   Despite their rejection of this loan, the banks remain open to future opportunities. 
"Given another deal, another country, we might consider it. . . . 
We aren't closing our door entirely," said one banker.

   Representatives of member countries of the Inter-American Development Bank decided to postpone until June a decision on major changes in voting power at the 44-nation agency. 

   The U.S., over the opposition of Latin American countries and with little support from other industrial nations, has been demanding a change in IADB lending policies that would give Washington a larger say in the approval or rejection of loans. 

   A special committee representing 12 countries agreed at a closed-door session Saturday that the IADB should have $1.92 billion for loans to the poorest Latin countries during the four-year period ending in 1990. 
These resources for the IADB's Fund for Special Operations are provided as grants by the U.S. and other donor countries. 

   The agreement on increasing IADB lending to the poorest countries in the region, which include Bolivia, Ecuador Paraguay, the Dominican Republic and several Central American nations, apparently would permit the international agency to double the amount of its lending to these countries. 

   The IADB's 28th annual conference formally opens today. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker will be among the speakers.

   The property-casualty insurance industry had record 1986 net income of $12.7 billion, according to final figures prepared by the Insurance Information Institute. 
The preliminary estimate had been $11.5 billion. 

   Net included $6.5 billion of realized capital gains and $600 million of federal income-tax credits. 
Net for 1985 was $1.9 billion, which included a $5.6 billion operating loss. 

   The industry had 1986 operating profit of $5.6 billion, the institute said. 
The preliminary estimate had been $4.5 billion. 
Operating profit primarily consisted of a pre-tax underwriting loss of $15.8 billion and pre-tax net investment income of $21.8 billion. 

   Daniel J. McNamara, president of Insurance Services Office Inc., an insurance data-gathering organization, said despite the industry's dramatic gains, several factors "may threaten the continuity of the recovery." 
Among them, he cited a heavy dependence on capital gains resulting from the 1986 bull market, an unusually small number of natural catastrophes during the year, and the erratic nature of the recovery. 

   Fifteen property-casualty companies became insolvent during the year, he said, bringing the three-year failure total to a record 56 companies.

   A SOVIET OFFICIAL SAID the U.S. is attempting to scuttle an arms pact. 

   Kremlin arms-control official Viktor Karpov said U.S. demands over short-range nuclear missiles and concern over Moscow's conventional forces may be aimed at blocking a U.S.-Soviet agreement on the elimination of medium-range weapons from Europe. 
Karpov said a U.S. proposal made at the Geneva arms talks included a plan to convert U.S. midrange weapons into shorter-range arms rather than destroy them. 

   White House Chief of Staff Baker said in an ABC-TV interview that "it would be likely" that Gorbachev and Reagan will hold another summit.

   AQUINO ORDERED the Philippine military to crush the opposition. 

   Speaking from a bomb-damaged grandstand at the Philippines Military Academy, Aquino said her peace policy had failed and she directed the armed forces to "end all threats to freedom" by the country's communist rebels and rightist plotters. 
At least 350 people have been killed since a 60-day truce with the communist insurgents ended Feb. 8, including four people in last week's bomb explosion at the academy. 

   The Philippine president, in her commencement address at the academy, complained that the U.S. was giving advice instead of the aid it pledged.

   CONCERN MOUNTED over the cost of a prescription drug for AIDS. 

   The FDA gave approval Friday to Burroughs-Wellcome Co. to market the drug, AZT, for the treatment of AIDS and its related pneumonia. 
The drug's price -- $8,300 a year wholesale and $10,000 retail -- has alarmed physicians and consumer advocates, and unanswered questions about insurance and other coverage have prompted some to say the drug is beyond the reach of many AIDS patients. 

   In a six-month controlled trial last year, azidothymidine prolonged survival for AIDS patients. 
The drug's major side effects include severe anemia.

   The Energy Department ordered its three weapons-production nuclear reactors in South Carolina to reduce to half power after the National Academy of Sciences warned that the plants were operating beyond their capacity to handle certain accidents. 

   Energy Secretary John Herrington on Friday told officials at the Savannah River reactors to lower the plants' power level and asked the contractor, Du Pont Co., to calculate what level of power is appropriate to meet the concerns of the academy. 

   The academy recently told the Energy Department that it couldn't "conclude with confidence" that significant core damage would be avoided if there was a severe loss-of-coolant accident. 
That type of accident is considered dangerous because it can leave the reactor's core without water needed to prevent steam from building up to explosive levels or fuel rods from melting. 

   The power cutbacks lower the Energy Department's capacity to produce material for nuclear weapons. 
The cutbacks could be temporary depending on results from additional tests that will be conducted, a department spokeswoman said.

   A Pentagon appeals board ruled that Lester Crown, a General Dynamics Corp. director, can retain his security clearance. 

   The matter had been under review because Mr. Crown had been named an unindicted co-conspirator in a 1972 bribery case in Illinois. 
A recent change in Pentagon rules said being named an unindicted co-conspirator could be grounds for revocation of a person's clearance, though such revocation isn't automatic. 

   Had the Pentagon revoked Mr. Crown's clearance, the company would have been forced to remove him from the board to remain eligible to handle classified Defense Department contracts.

   Differences over the status of West Berlin have held up an agreement between the Common Market and the Soviet-led Comecon trading bloc aimed at ending 30 years of mutual non-recognition. 

   Three days of talks by senior officials ended Friday without an accord on a draft declaration that would establish formal relations between the two blocs and a framework for future cooperation on trade and other matters. 

   A European Community statement said that "some progress was made toward clarifying positions and bringing them closer together." 
Both sides agreed on another meeting, but no date was set. 

   The EC insists that the accord refer to West Berlin as an integral part of the community. 
So far this has been rejected by Comecon, formally the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, which doesn't recognize West Berlin as part of West Germany. 

   Comecon has bowed to the EC's demand that recognition of the Eastern-bloc group won't hinder the community's trade relations with individual Comecon countries. 
The community, which had a $5 billion trade deficit with Comecon nations last year, maintains that the trading bloc has no legal authority to negotiate on behalf of its 10 members, as the 12-nation EC does under the Treaty of Rome. 
EC negotiations on trade accords with Romania, Czechoslovakia and Hungary are at an advanced stage. 

   Neither side has recognized the other's existence since the EC was created in 1957. 
Discussions on formal recognition were broken off in 1981 following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. 
Talks resumed in September, and in January the EC held its first formal talks with the Soviet Union on establishing diplomatic ties.

   The gift from Mr. Anderson, 69-year-old founder and owner of Topa Equities Ltd., and from his wife, Marion, is the largest single private contribution in the history of the California university system, UCLA said. 
The donation initiates a drive to raise $50 million of private and state funds for a new business school building on the Westwood campus, according to a UCLA spokeswoman. 

   Mr. Anderson graduated from UCLA in 1940 and, after earning a Harvard MBA degree and a law degree, became a founding partner of the Los Angeles law firm of Kindel and Anderson. 
Topa Equities is a closely held holding company for financial services, beverage distribution and real estate operations, with annual sales of about $350 million. 

   The UCLA graduate management school currently has about 1,200 students in its masters and doctoral programs.

   French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and officials of Walt Disney Co. tomorrow will sign the final contract bringing a $2 billion amusement park to a Paris suburb by 1992. 

   The signing will follow nearly two years of negotiations since Disney narrowed its choice for a European park to Spain and France. 
The company signed an initial agreement on the park with then-French Premier Laurent Fabius in December 1985, but negotiations were delayed after the change in French governments last March. 

   The French Communist Party had raised objections about proposed working conditions, the right-wing National Front Party objected to the potential hiring of immigrants to work there, and local groups opposed some of the details of the proposed 1,200-acre first phase. 
Eventually, the park is expected to employ 30,000 people and be host to 10 million visitors a year. 

   French officials said a private company would be created, with 60% owned by French interests and as much as 40% by American interests, including Disney's 17% share. 
Disney, a Burbank, Calif.-based entertainment concern, will supervise construction and control park management. 
The government agreed to extend the Paris subway system to the park site, at Marne-la-Vallee, about 25 miles east of Paris. 

   The Paris park will be Disney's second outside the U.S. 
The first, in Tokyo, opened four years ago.

   Ecolab Inc. said it signed a definitive agreement to buy ChemLawn Corp. for about $370 million, or $36.50 a share, apparently scuttling Waste Management Corp.'s hostile takeover bid for ChemLawn. 

   Ecolab's surprise bid came on the heels of Waste Management's sweetened offer on Friday of $35 a share for ChemLawn. 
ChemLawn, a Columbus, Ohio, lawn care concern, had been seeking a friendly suitor since it rejected Waste Management's initial $27 a share offer in February. 

   A Waste Management spokesman yesterday said the Oak Brook, Ill.-based waste disposal concern wouldn't have any immediate comment on the announcement. 
Waste Management said only 121 ChemLawn shares had been tendered to it by last Thursday. 

   The acquisition announcement was made after the markets closed Friday. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Ecolab shares closed at $30.875, down 12.5 cents. 
In national over-the-counter trading ChemLawn shares rose $1.875 to $36. 

   In an interview, Pierson M. Grieve, chairman, president and chief executive officer of St. Paul, Minn.-based Ecolab, said his company approached ChemLawn with a friendly offer on Feb. 27, the day after Waste Management made its initial bid. 
Neither company disclosed Ecolab's interest at the time and ChemLawn said it had instructed its financial advisor, Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., to look for other purchasers. 
Meanwhile, ChemLawn adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to fend off hostile bidders. 

   In a brief statement Friday, ChemLawn said it had dropped the shareholder rights plan. 
Mr. Grieve said Ecolab decided to make a pre-emptive offer for ChemLawn before Waste Management raised its bid. 

   Ecolab's offer is conditioned on the tender of at least 5.3 million ChemLawn shares and gives Ecolab an option to buy all ChemLawn's authorized unissued shares for $36.50 each if there is another higher bid. 
Mr. Grieve also said holders of 25% of ChemLawn's outstanding shares have agreed to tender them to Ecolab. 
If the transaction isn't completed, under certain conditions, ChemLawn has agreed to pay Ecolab $20 million. 

   "We feel we've locked it up pretty tight," Mr. Grieve said. 

   Ecolab makes cleaning and sanitizing products for institutions and was formerly known as Economics Laboratory Inc. 
For its second quarter ended Dec. 31, Ecolab had net income of $10.6 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $421.8 million. 
Earnings included a $2 million gain from the sale of assets. 
The company had net income for its fiscal year ended June 30, 1986, of $43.7 million, or $1.62 a share, on sales of $812.9 million. 

   Mr. Grieve said the ChemLawn acquisition should boost Ecolab's earnings for the remainder of the fiscal year since Ecolab's results will include ChemLawn's seasonally strongest quarter. 
That benefit is likely to be nearly offset in fiscal 1988 as ChemLawn's full-year results are absorbed, he said. 

   Meanwhile, ChemLawn said its directors approved severance agreements for senior management, including Jack Van Fossen, chairman and chief executive officer, "to encourage (managers) to stay with ChemLawn through the transition."The agreements provide for lump sum payments equal to 2.99 times a terminated manager's average base pay for the preceding five years 

   Ecolab said it has arranged financing for the acquisition
with Citicorp of New York. Mr. Grieve said Ecolab might sell
some assets following the merger to cut its debt load, but he
declined to elaborate.
   Analysts expressed surprise at the size of the Ecolab bid and Mr. Grieve acknowledged the bid was "a full price." 
But he said Ecolab expects that its sales expertise will help improve ChemLawn's future earnings. 
"This wasn't an opportunistic move," he said. 
"It fulfills our longstanding strategic plan to move into the residential services market."

<HL> State Department's Counsel, Sofaer, Draws Fire
For 'Politically Motivated' View of '72 ABM Pact

   Abraham Sofaer, the State Department's legal adviser and a former federal judge, isn't used to being on the receiving end of harsh verdicts. 
But recently some senators called his work "absurd," "illogical" and "distorted." 

   Mr. Sofaer is the author of a controversial reinterpretation of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty that would permit wider testing of President Reagan's "Star Wars" defense system. 
Many arms control experts claim his reading is politically motivated and would gut the treaty by contradicting 15 years of established practice under the U.S.-Soviet pact. 

   The aggressive Mr. Sofaer, who has a strong influence on many foreign policy issues, may be upsetting the delicate balance between his dual roles as the secretary of state's lawyer and the senior U.S. official charged with making sure that foreign policy conforms to international law. 
Too often, he is perceived as being out in front of the parade, rather than keeping an eye on the procession. 

   "I think he's smart, but I also feel he's applying his talents in directions that are not necessarily consistent with what the State Department should be doing," says Sen. Carl Levin, a member of the Armed Services Committee. 
"I don't view the State Department's position as undermining treaties," adds the Michigan Democrat. 

   Last week, Mr. Sofaer, 48 years old, angered even his supporters by trying to deflect some of the congressional criticism of his interpretation on the Antiballistic Missile Treaty by blaming a young staff lawyer for careless research. 
The remark angered the White House, which fears Mr. Sofaer may have undercut his interpretation, and prompted some protesting staff members to don yellow stickers saying, "I am not a young lawyer." 

   Arms control is only one of the issues in which the feisty, 5-foot-4-inch legal adviser is embroiled. 
Justice Department officials claim that he was too soft on Israel when he headed a task force investigating Jonathan Pollard, a U.S. analyst convicted of spying for Israel. 
And international lawyers complain that he is on shaky ground when he pushes his hard-line view that the U.S. has the legal right to kidnap suspected terrorists and use force against states that harbor them. 

   Some experts fear that the result may be that the U.S., once in the forefront of developing international law, now is seen by some other nations as bending statutes to suit its national security goals. 
They cite such incidents as last year's naval maneuvers near the Gulf of Sidra as a thinly disguised attempt to use international law concerning freedom of navigation as an excuse to provoke Libya into attacking U.S. ships. 

   "He has to be not only the advocate, but the legal conscience of the country," says Richard Bilder, professor of law at the University of Wisconsin and a former attorney in the legal adviser's office. 
"Part of his job is reflecting the point of view that international law has its own integrity, and that the long-term interests of the country are best served by a policy of respect for international law. 
There are some of us who believe he has not done as much as we'd like to see in that area." 

   Mr. Sofaer declined to be interviewed for this article. 

   Delicate and diplomatic are two words that aren't usually associated with Mr. Sofaer. 
"He's a very bright fellow, but he has no experience in international law and seems to leap at very radical conclusions based on what looks like superficial research," says Alfred Rubin, professor of international law at Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. 

   Unlike most of his cautious predecessors, who dispensed behind-the-scenes legal advice to the department's bureaucracy, Abe Sofaer's ingenuity and boundless energy have made him a high-profile foreign policy player and given him direct access to the secretary of state, George Shultz. 

   Late one evening in October 1985, for instance, Mr. Sofaer was finishing his controversial reinterpretation of the U.S.-Soviet arms control agreement, which was due the next day, when he learned the U.S. had forced down an Egyptian aircraft carrying terrorists who had killed an American. 
Immediately convening a legal task force to study extradition procedures, he worked through the night, shuttling between both projects and keeping himself and the staff awake by ordering endless rounds of pizza and singing operatic arias in his rich baritone voice. 
He produced a novel theory of using piracy laws to go after terrorists. 

   He has some other novel ideas too. 
Concerning the kidnapping of suspected terrorists, for instance, he once said, "You might just find a fellow somewhere -- all tied up. 
He might be sent to a country where we have an effective extradition treaty." 
Wouldn't that be illegal kidnapping? he was asked. 
"We're talking about informal civilized arrangements with friends," he replied with a smile. 

   A senior administration official says Mr. Sofaer's views in part are colored by his early months on the job, when he was closely questioned by conservatives because he had been appointed to the bench in New York by President Carter, following a distinguished career as a law professor at Columbia University. 
He is a member of a slim minority within a minority -- a Jew raised in Bombay, India, by parents of Iraqi origin. 

   The senior official, who has had many dealings with Mr. Sofaer, says that in conversations, the former judge goes out of his way to support "the aims of the administration," and to "pepper his conversations with references of support for the president." 

   Nevertheless, there is broad agreement that Mr. Sofaer has brought a new prominence to the tiny legal adviser's office. 
For example, the bureau, known as "L" in the department's bureaucratic parlance, was put in charge when Secretary Shultz set up a task force to provide information to the various agencies and committees investigating the Iran-Contra scandal. 
"It's the first I can remember us heading anything up," says Michael Kozak, a 16-year veteran. 

   Four days after Mr. Sofaer was appointed to the office, in June 1985, he plunged into his work when hijackers seized a Trans World Airlines jet in the Middle East and killed an American passenger. 
He quickly saw a way to satisfy the terrorists' demand that certain Shiite prisoners in Israel be released. 
Several years earlier, the U.S. had stated that the prisoners were being held illegally and should be freed, so, Mr. Sofaer reasoned, all the administration had to do was restate its position. 
He took the idea directly to Mr. Shultz, who agreed. 

   "There is a sense of energy and competence in the bureau now," adds Elliott Abrams, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs. 
"People very much want the legal adviser's views and care what he thinks." 

   Justice Department officials, however, criticize Mr. Sofaer's handling of the Pollard spy case. 
After he led a joint State-Justice investigating team to Israel in December 1985, he said Jerusalem had been fully cooperative, when, in fact, the Israelis had withheld information from the team. 
William Webster, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (who recently was selected by President Reagan to take over as director of the Central Intelligence Agency), said Israel had provided only "selective cooperation." 

   Mr. Sofaer's supporters say Justice officials aren't accustomed to the delicate diplomacy needed when dealing with sovereign states. 
They assert that Mr. Sofaer's method produced more, not less, cooperation from Israel.

<HL> Mutual Funds Managed Investing:
IRA Influx to Stocks Shows Mixed Results

<TEXT>
   Individual retirement account (IRA) dollars are helping stoke the continuing stock market rally, but they can also dilute returns for some mutual fund shareholders. 

   Heavy cash infusions in a soaring market can be a mixed blessing for the many equity fund managers obliged to stay fully invested in stocks. 
The new cash-in-hand just hasn't had enough time to earn as much as the "old" part of the portfolio, weakening the overall return. 
"It's an arithmetic question and an arithmetic answer. 
The smaller the fund the more potential for underperformance," says William W. Hewitt, an executive vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a unit of American Express Co. New funds -- latecomers in a rising market -- are particularly susceptible. 

   Just how much IRA money is flowing into the stock market through funds these days is hard to pin down, since hard data lags by several months. 

   "January was a huge sales month with some modest shift to equity sales," says Al Johnson, chief economist for the Investment Company Institute, an industry trade group. 

   Overall new sales of equity mutual funds (excluding dividend reinvestment)jumped to $6.51 billion in January from $4.97 billion in December, according to the ICI. 
"Some of the folks in the trade say the equity funds are getting big play in terms of IRA flows," says Mr. Johnson. 
Nonetheless, the figures through January (a big IRA month) show that bond and income funds account for $3 out of every $4 of sales. 

   A more recent informal survey of several mutual fund complexes corroborates that ratio, although equity fund sales are growing. 
It also underscores a huge overall increase in dollars being put into many types of funds, both in IRA and other accounts. 

   For example, Fidelity Investments says cash levels for its 10 growth funds have hovered at around 5% since yearend. 
Meanwhile assets in those funds have risen to about $15.59 billion from $11.22 billion. 
Assets at Fidelity Magellan alone have risen $2.55 billion since yearend. 
Of course, part of the gains are due to appreciation in stock values. 

   Some portfolio managers try to offset the crush of cash pouring in during an up market by buying stock-index futures contracts as a temporary proxy for stocks -- a move that allows them to buy time before buying stocks. 
As they fill in the equities, they sell the futures. 

   "You can fine-tune your cash position" with futures, says M. David Testa, president of T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund. 
The concern is seeking the same sort of leeway for its big T. Rowe Price International Stock Fund, whose shareholders will soon be asked to approve the fund's use of futures on foreign stock-indexes. 

   This year, through last Thursday, the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund gained 19.46%, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., which monitors mutual fund performance. 
That was just a tad below the 20.43% gain in the Lipper Growth Fund Index for the same period, and not far below the fund's 1986 full-year gain of 21.83%. 
Meanwhile, fund assets advanced to about $1.60 billion from $1.30 billion at yearend. 

   Still, Mr. Testa says, "I don't get real excited if I'm ahead or behind" the short-term market. 
He notes that the goal of mutual fund investors is longer term. 

   Just how much of the surge in equity mutual fund sales comes from IRA dollars compared with unrestricted investments isn't clear. 

   Fidelity says its top-selling funds to IRA accounts during January and February were Magellan, Puritan and Capital Appreciation. 
Last year they were Magellan, Puritan and Overseas. 

   At T. Rowe Price, the big IRA winners so far this year are High Yield, Prime Reserve and International Stock, compared with last year's Prime Reserve, High Yield and Ginnie Mae. 

   Vanguard Group of Investment Cos. says its top IRA sellers are the same for both years: Windsor II, Vanguard GNMA and STAR Fund. 
Shearson didn't break out IRA accounts, but says its biggest sellers overall this year are Shearson-Lehman Long-Term Government Securities Portfolio, Managed Governments Inc. and Option Income Portfolio. 

   ---
   Oppenheimer Management revved up considerable interest last year when it offered a sports car as top prize in a controversial mutual fund sales promotion. 

   So, who has the keys? 

   "Nobody won it," says Bridget Macaskill, a senior vice president of the concern, a unit of London-based Mercantile House Holdings PLC. 

   The contest required exceeding $5 million with a minimum of 10 sales. 
"Certain people sold the right (dollar) amount, but not with the right amount of tickets," she explains. 

   Meanwhile, fund regulators pondered whether any further rein on industry incentives was needed. 
They decided to leave the matter in the hands of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which already had a proposal on its books that would ban non-cash incentives to broker-dealers selling real estate partnerships. 
The NASD says at the moment it hasn't any similar plans for funds. 
Currently, funds must disclose any material, non-cash sales incentive in the prospectus. (Oppenheimer did.)

<HL> COMB to Acquire Rest of Cable Network
With Warrants Convertible Into Stock

   C.O.M.B. Co. agreed to buy the half of Cable Value Network that it doesn't already own and to pay for the stake with warrants that can be converted into common stock. 

   Terms of the agreement in principle call for the 17 cable-television operators who hold the other half of Cable Value Network to receive about eight million warrants. 
Each warrant would be convertible into one C.O.M.B. share at an exercise price of $18.125 a share. 
C.O.M.B. currently has about 18.1 million shares outstanding. 

   The value of the purchase couldn't yet be ascertained. 
The cost to C.O.M.B., a direct-mail merchandiser, will depend on how much its share price is above that figure when the warrants are exercised; they expire in five years. 

   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, C.O.M.B. stock closed at $20.25 a share, unchanged. 

   C.O.M.B.'s purchase would give it full control of the fast-growing home-shopping television network and a long-term commitment from the cable operators that they would carry the network. 

   C.O.M.B.'s board also voted to change C.O.M.B.'s name to CVN after the purchase. 

   Among the group of cable-television operators selling the stake are Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, the nation's largest cable operator; Viacom International Inc. of New York; and Warner Communications Inc. of New York. 

   "There are a lot of positive benefits to this," said Larry Gerbrandt, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates in Carmel, Calif. 
"This is a way of bringing the 50% private portion into a public stock. 
As long as it was held privately it had no market value." 

   Such a move will help Cable Value fund its rapid growth through the capital markets and give C.O.M.B. full access to the cable operation's cash flow, Mr. Gerbrandt said. 
Also, the new setup will be more readily managed than the joint venture arrangement, said Mr. Gerbrandt. 

   Ted Deikel, chairman of C.O.M.B. and Cable Value, said the new arrangement will allow C.O.M.B. to apply its direct-marketing skill to the cable television business. 

   Cable Value's cable-company investors hope this marketing ability results in new services to woo and keep subscribers. 
The object is to clearly distinguish Cable Value from Clearwater, Fla.-based Home Shopping Network Inc. 

   Home Shopping is its biggest and oldest competitor, with $1 billion in annual sales. 
It has become even more formidable in recent months by branching beyond cable and onto the broadcast airwaves. 
It appears on UHF stations in some markets, a fact that concerns cable companies as they are charging subscribers for what Home Shopping is now giving away free in some areas. 

   Formed about a year ago, Cable Value is expected to have annual sales of $350 million to $400 million, said Mr. Deikel.

   Dixons Group PLC, after winning control of Cyclops Corp. Wednesday through a tender offer, is wasting little time taking charge of the Pittsburgh-based company. 

   London-based Dixons, an electrical appliance retailer, yesterday named three top executives to Cyclops's board and accepted the resignations of seven directors. 
The changes reduce the number of directors to six from 10. 

   Named to the board were Egon von Greyerz, Dixons vice chairman and financial director; Gerald M.N. Corbett, corporate finance director; and Geoffrey Budd, secretary. 

   Resigning from the board were Howard J. Burnett, Thomas Phillips Johnson, H. Frederick Krimendahl II, William E. Lieser, William L. Morbratten, Konrad M. Weis and Howard M. Winterson. 

   Dixons's changes leave three Cyclops executives on the board, including William H. Knoell, president and chief executive officer. 
Dixons won the right to name a majority of board members under a merger agreement last month with Cyclops. 

   As previously reported, Cyclops holders tendered 2.3 million, or 54%, of the 4.3 million shares outstanding, under Dixons's offer to buy all shares for $90.25 each, or $384 million. 
The offer expired Wednesday. 
Coupled with Dixons's existing stake, the tender boosted the company's holding to 56%. 

   In agreeing last month to be acquired by Dixons, Cyclops management rebuffed a competing bid from a group led by Audio/Video Affiliates Inc., a Dayton, Ohio-based consumer electronics retailer. 
The group, which last week conditionally offered $92.50 a share for Cyclops, has said it may seek to halt Dixons's completion of the merger. 

   The focus of both suitors is Cyclops's Silo Inc. retailing division, which operates a nationwide chain of appliance and consumer electronics stores. 
Dixons plans to retain Silo and sell Cyclops's specialty steel and nonresidential construction business.

Theater: Edible Props

<DATELINE> NEW YORK </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jan Marasek spent weeks last fall searching for the perfect date. 
Not to fill lonely hours on Saturday night, but to fill a box for the actors starring in Neil Simon's "Broadway Bound." 

   "I had such a hard time," says Mr. Marasek, production property master for Emanuel Azenberg, the Broadway show's producer. 
"They didn't want pits, they didn't want them coated; the ones from Balducci's and Zabar's were too big to mouth. 
I finally ended up in a health-food restaurant. 
I'm always looking for dates," he says with a sigh. 

   Like many theatrical property people, Mr. Marasek finds that his role often resembles a cross between a maitre d's and a magician's. 
Years ago, he says, scripts frequently called for actors to be smoking; now they always seem to be eating. 
And edible props are seldom to property masters' liking. 
They first have to please the actors, who may have food allergies or dietary restrictions. 

   "When Carol Channing was starring in 'Hello, Dolly!' her doctors came backstage to ask what she was eating," remembers Mr. Marasek. 
"In one scene, she gobbled down dumplings, which were made of spun sugar so she could eat them easily. 
It turned out we were giving her about a cup of sugar per performance." 
When her physicians demanded an immediate change, Mr. Marasek worked with property man Leo Herbert to produce dumplings made of thin paper sprayed with tea and shaped over small light bulbs to dry. 
At each performance, Miss Channing would "eat" the dumplings and dispose of them discreetly when she wiped her mouth. 

   Since almost no one would appreciate the same foods eight times a week, property men have devised creative substitutes. 
Mr. Marasek has made eggs from apricot halves surrounded by white bread lightly sprinkled with boiling water. 
For the liver in "Brighton Beach Memoirs" he used pumpernickel, which, creatively shaped with a pizza cutter, also stars as the pot roast in "Broadway Bound." 

   "'Biloxi Blues' has the big mess-hall scene, where the kid hates the food," he says of the Neil Simon play, which is now on a national tour. 
"When Matthew Broderick starred, he wanted to almost retch when he saw it." 
The concoction was an unappetizing combination of apple butter and green food coloring. 

   Property masters also worry about safety. 
Mr. Marasek has been known to sew a loaf of bread together to prevent the cast from tripping over a fallen slice. 
Eating itself poses a risk to actors, who may swallow more than their lines. 
"A dry cookie can be a disaster," he says. 
During tryouts of "Broadway Bound," for example, actor John Randolph caught a seed in his throat from a piece of rye bread. 
From then on, only seedless loaves were purchased. 

   Another danger is backstage cooking, which increases the risk of a fire, not to mention the horrifying possibility of a cast felled by food poisoning, or a theater overrun with living things that haven't bought tickets. 
That's why prop men like to keep edibles to a minimum, and preserve purely decorative foods with shellac. 

   "It's good for something with a low moisture content," says Edward Gianfrancesco, resident designer at Off Broadway's WPA Theatre. 
"But we had a prop person use it once on cheeses and fruits. 
It was great for a while, except that the varnish became a perfect envelope for everything to turn totally rotten inside." 

   Real food is also expensive. 
Since the 1985 Broadway opening of Herb Gardner's "I'm Not Rappaport," Mr. Herbert's staff has bought approximately 84 heads of lettuce, 84 loaves of bread, 63 pounds of tunafish salad, 42 sticks of butter and 28 jars of mayonnaise just to make one sandwich for each performance. 
"Those in the front row have to see that it's tuna," says Mr. Herbert. 
But neither of the actors who has had to taste it has liked tuna, which is why the hidden half of the sandwich is purposely made only with butter. 
Such grocery costs mount, and although sponsors sometimes ease them by providing coupons or free goods in exchange for a program credit, the arrangement doesn't always suffice. 

   "Planter's is giving us cashews for 'Broadway Bound,'" says Mr. Marasek. 
"The cast goes through a pound a show, even though there's only a line about one nut in the script. 
We don't have the nerve to ask Planter's for all the nuts we use, and they're $5.99 a jar in the supermarket. 
No one admits to eating them, but," he says with determination, "I'm investigating now." 

   To fill a production's gastronomical needs, property masters have gone everywhere from Oriental food shops to caterers. 
Mr. Marasek once even consulted the Catholic Church to find out what the Host was made of, to see if it would be a viable substitute for the "Hello, Dolly!" dumplings. 
It wasn't. 

   With so much time, energy and money at stake, property masters prefer artificial food. 
Mr. Marasek once made a turkey out of plastic-treated felt and cucumber slices out of silicon caulking compound. 
Liquor is almost never real, as some thieves discovered when they broke into Broadway's Ethel Barrymore Theatre, where Andrew Bergman's "Social Security" is playing. 
What they thought was high-quality Scotch proved to be caramel-colored water. 

   But although artifice plays a major role in property design, theater professionals strive to make their fake edibles look real. 
Mr. Marasek usually injects the plastic oranges in "Broadway Bound" with water to give them the appropriate weight. 
Sound is important, too: If an actress throws what is supposedly a tray of frozen fish sticks in a processing plant, they can't sound like styrofoam blocks. 
This was the problem confronting Mr. Gianfrancesco, who designed the set, complete with styrofoam fish covered with sawdust batter, for the WPA Theatre's recent production of Israel Horovitz's "North Shore Fish." 
Wood, he reasoned, was too heavy a substitute and a potential danger to the actors. 

   "For that particular scene, we made a batch out of Homosote, which is like a very dense cardboard," he explains. 
"That tray had to come out in just the proper sequence for her to hurl it and get the sound." 

   There is, however, one area in which no one seeks authenticity. 

   "You don't want the audience to start smelling food cooking," warns Mr. Marasek, "or they'll all want to walk out to the nearest restaurant and eat."

Geriatrics Observed: Hubris and Humor
---
By Hilton Kramer</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Kingsley Amis, who turns 65 this year, is the finest comic novelist England has produced since Evelyn Waugh. 
Like Mr. Waugh, he is often said to be a reactionary in his social views, and the charge is not unfounded. 
Certainly he takes a very mordant view of what are now the standard liberal pieties. 
Socialism, feminism and the emancipated culture and life styles of the educated middle class -- about these and other phenomena sacred to the liberal mind, Mr. Amis clearly feels a deep revulsion. 

   He isn't shy about expressing it, either. 
On the contrary, he is relentless, hilarious and devastating. 
It was not to be expected, therefore, that he would be easily forgiven by those who are the butt of his jokes, and he hasn't been. 
His last novel, "Stanley and the Women," was so reviled, especially by feminists, that it met with some difficulty in finding an American publisher. 

   With his new novel, however, even Mr. Amis's most implacable liberal critics have been persuaded to suspend hostilities. 
It is not that "The Old Devils" (Summit, 294 pages, $16.95) represents any fundamental change in Mr. Amis's attitudes toward human nature or modern society or anything else. 
Far from it. 
"The Old Devils" is in some respects the grimmest novel Mr. Amis has yet written. 
Moreover, its humor, though at times uproarious, is not the kind that mitigates the author's disabused view of the human condition. 
The laughter in this book, as in others by Mr. Amis, leaves a bitter aftertaste. 

   What has changed is Mr. Amis's subject. 
In "The Old Devils" he is now writing about the onset of old age -- not only its physical debilities and social humiliations but its moral illuminations, too -- and writing about this condition from the inside. 
The result is a book that is so vivid, so original, so understanding and so wise, that it is likely to become -- at least for those with the stomach to face its dour implications -- a classic among novels dealing with old age, and a comic classic at that. 

   The story is set in a small coastal town in South Wales in the 1980s. 
The old devils of the title are a group of mostly retired middle-class sexagenarians and their wives who have long lived in the same community and know just about everything there is to know about each other. 
Some of the men once had literary or at least academic ambitions, but now daily life for this circle of aging friends is a more or less settled routine bounded by the local pub (for the men) and get-togethers in each other's houses (for the women), where quantities of drink -- whiskey for the men, wine for the women -- keep them in a state of perpetual inebriate civility. 

   Their marriages, though mostly surviving, are in various states of disrepair, and likewise their health -- though only in Wales, perhaps, could geriatric medicine be expected to smile quite so benignly upon such Gargantuan intakes of alcohol as are described in this novel. 
However placid the surface routine of their lives may be, the minds of these characters are nonetheless awash with sundry regrets, recriminations, and guilt, mostly having to do with the erotic misadventures of their youth, which it is the function of the steady drinking, of course, to assuage and tranquilize. 

   This it generally succeeds in doing -- until, that is, the crisis that is visited upon them by the return to their midst of the glamorous couple, Alun and Rhiannon Weaver, who have long occupied a special place in their erotic reveries. 
Alun Weaver is a handsome television personality who, after a moderately successful but now declining career as a professional (which is to say, a phony) Welshman in London, has returned to Wales in the hope of reviving his sagging fortunes on native ground. 
Like his still-beautiful wife Rhiannon, he is also the lost love of several of these characters, who prove to be as eager as ever to succumb to his charms. 

   Unlike Rhiannon, however, who proves to be the most appealing woman Mr. Amis has ever created in his fiction, Alun is a complete rogue, and it is his callous behavior toward just about everyone in this old circle of friends -- not only the women -- that precipitates the climactic events of the story. 

   Make no mistake: "The Old Devils" is a harsh, caustic, unremitting tale of disappointed hopes, aggravated memories and sublimated passions. 
Yet it has a happy ending of the sort we have a right to expect from a true comedy. 
Mr. Amis never averts his glance from the wreckage of mind and body that age brings in its wake, but in the end he strikes a surprising and persuasive note of forbearance. 
And along the way in this flawlessly constructed tale he springs so many other surprises and reversals of sympathy and understanding that we are never in any doubt about the fact that we are in the presence of a master storyteller who has faced the worst and somehow come to terms with it.

Tidbits From Spring Training
---
By Frederick C. Klein</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> Fort Lauderdale, Fla. </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Every year, when I return from baseball spring training, people ask me what I saw that I liked. 
Every year I answer "spring training." 

   The institution, not its component teams or parks, gets me every time, and the reasons have nothing to do with any dewy stuff about hope springing eternal in my ball-fan's breast. 
I like the feeling of being in warm sunshine when two-thirds of my fellow citizens are walking around wearing mittens. 
I like watching baseball from close range with the smell of suntan lotion in my nostrils. 
I like the good nature of the crowds at contests in which playing, not winning or losing, usually takes precedence. 

   The word on spring training is getting around. 
Last year's attendance on the Florida and Arizona circuits set a record, and if the three sellouts in the five games I witnessed last week are any guide, this year's will set another. 
That's a dangerous trend, especially here in East Coast Florida, where the stone crab population is said to be dwindling. 
It held up well enough this month, though. 
So did the usual, ample stock of training-camp tidbits: 

   Monday, March 2 -- It's picture day at the New York Yankees camp here. 
Almost two dozen photogs turn as one and blaze away when Billy Martin, the Yanks' once and -- who knows? -- maybe future manager appears in the team's dugout, resplendent in tan shirt and slacks and snakeskin cowboy boots. 

   Martin is back for a second year as a Yankees' TV broadcaster. 
He hopes to do color commentary during games instead of the pre- and post-game assignments he drew last season. 
"Last year they gave me only a minute to talk sometimes," he snorts. 
"What can you say in a minute?" 

   Tuesday, March 3 -- Tom Lasorda, the Los Angeles Dodgers' manager, likes to lecture his players. 
His topic this day at Vero Beach is base running. 

   "I coached third base in the Majors, minors and winter leagues, and I knew how fast every one of my players could run," he said. 
"If I waved a guy from first to third on a hit, or from second to home, I expected him to make it. 
My man Joey {Amalfitano, the Dodgers' present third-base coach} expects the same. 
If you get thrown out, the fans'll boo him, but when you get back to the dugout, I'll boo you." 

   Sunday, March 8 -- The Atlanta Braves and Montreal Expos, arguably the two worst teams in the National League, meet in their common spring home of West Palm Beach. 
There seems to be a lot of applause, but really it's people swatting black "Florida bugs." 
The biggest cheer of the afternoon goes to this announcement over the public-address system: "To the owner of a gold Oldsmobile: You are blocking traffic, your doors are locked, your key is in the ignition . . . and your motor is running." 

   Monday, March 9 -- The Yankees play the Minnesota Twins at night in Fort Lauderdale before a full house of 6,793. 
It's the toughest crowd of my spring stay, by far. 
A young man sitting behind me, wearing a Yankee T-shirt, boos such Yankee stalwarts as Don Mattingly, Dave Winfield and Dave Righetti. 
When I ask him why, he replies that Mattingly and Winfield make too much money to suit him. 
I didn't have to ask about Righetti; he'd just given up a three-run, ninth-inning home run to pinchhitter Tim Laudner that sunk the Yanks, 54. 

   Even a white-haired vendor wasn't immune from criticism. 
When he handed an 85-cent bag of peanuts to a man down my row, the guy told him that in Yankee Stadium, the vendors flipped the bags behind their backs. 
"For $2 a bag, I'd flip 'em, too," the vendor snapped. (Actually, peanuts at Yankee Stadium sell for a mere 80 cents a bag.) 

   Tuesday, March 10 -- Another SRO throng is on hand to watch the Expos play the American League champion Boston Red Sox. 
The Red Sox have a long drive back to their base at Winter Haven, and stipulate that they will not hang around for extra innings. 
Wouldn't you know it? 
The game ends in an 8-8 tie with sunlight aplenty remaining. 

   Wednesday, March 11 -- The Texas Rangers travel to Miami from their new stadium at Port Charlotte to play the Baltimore Orioles in a night game. 
Attendance is sparse at the inner-city stadium, underlining speculation that the O's may seek spiffier digs one day. 

   Not long ago, the Orioles' farm system was the envy of the Majors, but no more. 
Six members of the team's starting lineup this night are new or recent acquisitions. 
They are Alan Wiggins (an ex-Padre), Rick Burleson (Angels), Fred Lynn (Angels), Ray Knight (Mets), Terry Kennedy (Padres) and Mike Hart (Twins). 
The youngest are Wiggins and Hart, both aged 29. 

   The O's 73-89 record last season was their first losing campaign since 1967, and a pitching slump was a major cause. 
Tonight, Mike Boddicker, Eric Bell and Don Aase three-hit the Rangers in a 2-1 win. 
"Last year we nibbled at the strike zone," the veteran Boddicker declared later. 
"This year we'll challenge the hitters." 
It also helps if your curve ball breaks a foot, like his just did. 

   Friday, March 13 -- The Dodgers are another team that fell on hard times last year, limping in fifth in the National League West. 
Their biggest problem was bum fielding, their 181 errors being a dubious Major League "most." 

   It is doubtful, however, if the 1986 team botched an inning as badly as the present one did the second against the New York Mets here today before a packed Holman Field: a walk, a balk, a wild pitch and two infield errors, plus a single, produced three Met runs. 

   Compounding the felony was a P.A. announcement following this disastrous frame. 
It plugged an instructional video by Manager Lasorda and his boys titled "The Dodger Way to Play Baseball." 
The Dodgers might not have their timing down yet, but that fella sure does.

   Once more you resort to facile and mendacious comparison of President Carter's conduct in the Iranian hostage crisis in 1980 to President Reagan's conduct in 1985-86 (editorial, March 5). 

   President Carter's statements on release of frozen Iranian assets -- including arms already bought but undelivered -- were entirely public. 
Moreover, there was to be no delivery of any assets until all hostages had been safely released. 
By contrast, President Reagan sold new arms that he delivered deviously and in total secrecy -- before hostages were released. 

   You observe that the Ayatollah Khomeini "never bothered" to respond to President Carter's public proposal. 
Quite true. 
He did, however, respond eagerly to President Reagan's secret proffer -- retaining hostages, of course, for future trading purposes. 

   What would have been the Journal's editorial reaction if it had been revealed, in September 1980, that Mr. Carter was engaged in secret arms-for-hostages exchanges with Khomeini?

Considers Making
A Large Acquisition</HL>

   The Canadian unit of Rothmans International PLC said it would consider spending as much as $500 million (Canadian) on an acquisition. 
This would be "about double" the $250 million in net proceeds it expects to receive from two recently announced transactions. 

   They include the December merger of Rothmans's tobacco business with a unit of Philip Morris Cos., New York, and the proposed sale of Rothmans's 50.1% stake in Canada's third largest brewery, Carling O'Keefe Ltd. 

   In a presentation to analysts, Rothmans Inc.'s president and chief executive officer, Patrick Fennell, said the bid for Rothmans's Carling shares, made last month by a unit of Australia-based Elder's IXL Ltd., would net Rothmans about $180 million, if approved, as expected, by governmental and regulatory authorities. 
The Elders offer is scheduled to expire next Thursday. 

   Mr. Fennell said Rothmans has "no targets" currently, and it hasn't retained a financial adviser to seek acquisitions. 
But he said the tobacco company is interested in "opportunities in consumer packaged goods," which he described as "largely recession-proof" and "an offset to the business we're clearly dependent on here in Canada." 

   Mr. Fennell said the merger of Rothmans's tobacco business with that of Benson &amp; Hedges (Canada) Inc. to form Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges, gives the new company a 32% share of the Canadian cigarette market, second to the 51% share held by market leader Imperial Tobacco Ltd., a unit of Montreal's Imasco Ltd. 

   Rothmans Inc. is 71.2%-owned by London-based Rothmans International.

   BRITOIL PLC, a British oil company, posted an after-tax profit for 1986, but an extraordinary charge resulted in a net loss for the year. 

   The company had after-tax earnings equivalent to $52.9 million, at current exchange rates, down 87% from $405.2 million in 1985. 
But an extraordinary charge of $80.1 million resulted in a net loss of $27.2 million for 1986. 
The extraordinary charge covered the write-down of Britoil's U.S. oil and natural-gas properties, which the company in November said it would seek to sell. 

   Britoil's revenue last year fell 46%, to $1.57 billion from $2.88 billion. 
The company attributed its lower after-tax earnings and revenue to the drop in oil prices. 
It said the average price of North Sea Brent crude oil fell to $15.50 a barrel last year from $27 in 1985. 
Oil and gas production was little changed last year, Britoil said.

<TEXT>
   The Feb. 26 page-one article on Louisiana education left the impression that business was shunning the state. 
That's not so. 
In 1986 business investment in Louisiana totaled more than $2.9 billion. 
Nearly $1 billion in new investment has already been announced for 1987. 
Investment in manufacturing over the past 10 years is more than $20 billion. 

   Despite the article's comments to the contrary, Louisiana workers in 1986 were deemed good enough by Boeing to locate a major facility in southwest Louisiana that will employ 1,400. 
And Martin Marietta has selected New Orleans as the site at which it will fabricate modules for the space station if it is the successful bidder on that project. 
Also, in the past few weeks Rockwell International has announced plans to move one of its electronics subsidiaries from Texas to northwest Louisiana. 

   As to workers of Cajun descent, they are capable enough and motivated enough to hold the bulk of the jobs in the offshore oil-exploration industry where the average wage approaches $30,000 a year. 
In addition, it was a task force of several thousand Cajuns that helped establish the offshore oil and gas industry in the North Sea, as they had done earlier in the Gulf of Mexico. 

   We in Louisiana are aware of the importance of education. 
It is the reason the state allocates nearly one of every three tax dollars to support our schools. 
It is also the reason we created a $2 billion trust fund for education -- the largest fund of its kind in the U.S. -- and have already deposited the first half-billion in the program. 

   We know more has to be done, but we aren't alone in our concern. 
Some 20 other states have also declared education to be the number one priority. 
This is not an isolated problem and certainly not one unique to Louisiana. 
Rather it is the result of a long-term decline in American education. 
In view of the pervasiveness of the problem, I don't know why Louisiana was singled out for your article, but I do know that we are one state that is attempting to do something about it. 

   Edwin Edwards
   Governor of Louisiana
   Baton Rouge
   ---
   The oil companies came in with the big bucks. 
The people and politicians of Louisiana fell for it. 
No matter how good the education system is, if students don't want to learn, nothing can change it. 

   The problems started when the oil-field jobs replaced education as the most important part of our lives. 
During the rise of oil, people quit school. 
There was no need for education when one could earn $25,000 to $50,000 a year in the oil field. 
Now the uneducated parents of our state cannot help their children with third-grade schoolwork. 

   As a graduate of the Louisiana school system, I got out of it what I put into it. 
It was up to me if I wanted an education. 

   Mr. Elliman of Lucas CAV Ltd. states that Louisiana doesn't have employees with the basic skills needed to adapt to change. 
I wonder if he knows who designed and built the giant offshore oil and gas platforms that provide heat and fuel for his house or business. 
If Lucas CAV Ltd. came to Louisiana, maybe my two brothers (both engineers) could work in Louisiana instead of Alabama and Massachusetts.

<TEXT>
   House Speaker James Wright's proposal to tax security transactions (news story, March 3) is an inefficient and dangerous way to reduce the federal deficit. 

   Rep. Wright fails to see that a substantial amount of funds in the equity markets is controlled by labor-backed pension funds, as well as monies invested on behalf of middle-class Americans via mutual funds. 
A tax on publicly traded stocks would make these instruments less attractive than other securities. 
Wealthy investors would choose to stay away from publicly traded domestic equities in favor of other investments. 
It is the middle-class, small investors who would bear a disproportionate amount of this tax, as they lack access to more sophisticated investments. 

   Derivative products, such as futures and options, would become more attractive. 
An investor who wished to put his money in NYSE stocks would find it more efficient to do so by taking long positions in index futures or synthetic positions built with options. 
Open interest in these instruments would increase, thereby levering up our already debt-ridden nation. 

   If we want to avoid abuses on Wall Street, we must deal with this problem directly. 
If we wish to reduce the deficit, we must control government excess and waste. 
Rep. Wright has found an industry that is currently politically vulnerable, and has decided to harness it to the burdens of a deficit that it did not directly produce. 

   Leonard A. Blum
   Los Angeles
   ---
   I applaud Speaker Wright's proposal. 
After all, the U.S. has a major deficit problem, and it's clear that everyone on Wall Street is an insider trader and deserves to be punished. 

   Since this transfer tax would not by itself solve the deficit problem, I suggest we try to think of other industries that are candidates for extra disciplinary taxes. 
The ideal candidates are industries where the actions of some notable participants have proved that their entire industry is corrupt. 

   How about pizza parlors? 
The recent "Pizza Connection" trial has proved that all pizza parlors are really just fronts for illegal drug activity. 
I propose an extra $2 tax on every pizza sold (50 cents each for individual slices). 

   Of course, some people might claim that much, if not all, of the disciplinary taxes are likely to be passed through to the innocent end consumer (investors in the first case, pizza lovers in the second), but I say we have to punish these corrupt industries, even if the methods are somewhat inefficient. 

   We need some more candidates. 
How about politicians? 
Recent trials in New York City proved that all politicans are crooks. 
An extra tax on politicians seems appropriate and is consistent with this new enlightened policy of disciplinary taxation. 
Politicians . . . 
Oops! 
You better be careful, Jim.

   I find the idea shocking and unjustified. 
General government services should be financed by the income tax. 
Our private sector is already in serious economic condition as a result of state and local governments' conversion of private property through the sales tax, property taxes on land, improvements and equipment, and extortionate building-permit fees.

   In the interests of punishing Wall Street for past sins, Mr. Wright proposes to tax pensions, IRAs, Keogh Plans, life-insurance policies and all other forms of retirement income that invest in publicly traded stocks. 

   David Stockman was right. 
Jim Wright is a snake-oil salesman who practices the politics of envy.

   Toshiba Corp. makes more than one million microwave ovens a year in Japan. 
This year, if Hisao Tanaka prevails, some 60,000 will be powered by American-made capacitors, and the huge U.S. trade deficit with Japan will be some $120,000 narrower. 

   For Mr. Tanaka, a veteran Toshiba manager who works out of an office park in this Boston suburb, persuading his Tokyo colleagues to buy U.S. parts for microwave ovens would be a small but important victory. 
In the past, Toshiba's engineers have resisted substituting American for Japanese parts. 

   As Toshiba's head buyer in the U.S., Mr. Tanaka is heavily engaged in Japan's latest trade war. 
His mission: to buy American. 
At times, though, it seems like mission impossible. 
Japan's imports of U.S. goods have indeed increased since Toshiba and other big Japanese companies began a much-publicized buy-American campaign in 1985, but the gains haven't come easily, and the trade deficit has grown, not shrunk. 

   Mr. Tanaka partly blames U.S. companies. 
All too often, he laments, they seem to go out of their way not to sell to Toshiba. 
They decline to bid on contracts that don't offer an immediate profit, refuse to provide the prompt service that Toshiba expects and occasionally insult the Japanese company -- a diversified multinational with $18.74 billion in sales last year -- by demanding cash on delivery. 
"I don't think they'd insist with General Electric," he says pointedly. 

   Some U.S. companies, on the other hand, question whether Toshiba is serious about buying American. 
A request for information by Mr. Tanaka was "a fishing expedition, and nothing happened after that," says Linda Saul, an administrator at a computerized-design company's sales office down the hall from him. 

   Mr. Tanaka concedes that out of every 10 U.S. companies he talks with, only one ends up doing business with Toshiba. 
And he acknowledges that some of his colleagues back in Japan aren't deeply committed to buying American. 
"It takes time to buy a new product -- especially from outside Japan. 
Nobody wants to take the risk of changing suppliers," he explains. 

   So, despite the dollar's two-year, 40% decline against the yen -- which makes American goods cheaper in Japan -- the U.S. trade deficit with Japan remains huge. 
Although Japan's imports of U.S. goods rose 19%, to $26.88 billion, last year, its exports to the U.S. also rose 19%, to $81.91 billion. 
As a result, the merchandise-trade deficit grew to $55.03 billion from $46.15 billion in 1985. 

   Some economists contend that it is just a matter of time until the higher yen makes U.S. goods so cheap the Japanese will buy them. 
"We are all disappointed that American exports haven't picked up as we expected," says Hugh Patrick, an economist at Columbia University. 
"But the things we tend to export are industrial products -- and it certainly takes time to generate contracts and start making sales." 

   A look at Mr. Tanaka's frustrations shows just how hard this can be. 
Many cultural and corporate differences impede U.S. sales to Japan, no matter how interested both sides claim to be. 

   Mr. Tanaka insists that Toshiba is clearly committed to buying American. 
The company opened its procurement office here last fall (another one, its first, is in San Francisco), doubled the number of buyers in America to eight and tripled its total U.S. procurement-office budget to $1 million a year. 

   Each day, Toshiba's U.S. buyers get a stream of facsimile messages from Tokyo asking them to find potential vendors, get price quotes or track down delayed orders. 
Occasionally, Mr. Tanaka, who will soon be transferred to Toshiba's international procurement operation in Tokyo, seeks more U.S. suppliers by going to trade shows and collecting catalogs or even by knocking on nearby doors. 

   The extra effort, he says, is starting to pay off. 
This year, Toshiba expects to place orders with 300 to 350 U.S. companies, up from about 200 in 1984. 
A GE-type conglomerate, Toshiba buys lots of things from the U.S.: semiconductors from Motorola Inc., work stations from Sun Microsystems Inc., automatic testing equipment from Teradyne Inc. 

   Last year, Mr. Tanaka supervised the purchase of $46 million of U.S. goods, up 53% from 1985. 
To help Toshiba increase its imports, Mr. Tanaka is even suggesting that it buy U.S. golf balls to sell to its 60,000 Japanese workers. 
"We must show them the enjoyment of a higher exchange rate," he says. 
(Mr. Tanaka himself purchases lots of U.S. beef, but he avoids the American-Japanese car wars -- he drives a German Audi.) 
All told, Toshiba expects to import some $520 million in goods from around the world in its fiscal year ending March 31, with most of that being purchased through trading companies or offices of foreign companies in Japan. 
About 70% of its imports come from the U.S. 

   Nevertheless, building American purchases is slow work, says Mr. Tanaka, who puts in a 13-hour day in order to talk with executives in Japan between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. Eastern time. 
"It took almost a year to train our employees to buy foreign products," he says. 

   Today, says Mr. Tanaka, a chain-smoking, coffee-gulping 36-year-old with a midfive-figure salary: "If the conditions on buying U.S. goods are the same as from Japanese companies, Toshiba policy is to buy from America. 
Two years ago, we would have bought Japanese." 

   For example, he found that a Toshiba microwave-oven plant in Nashville, Tenn., was satisfied with capacitors that it bought from Aerovox Corp., an RTE Corp. subsidiary based in New Bedford, Mass. 
He persuaded the oven makers in Japan to test Aerovox capacitors last year and now is negotiating a small contract to send 5,000 to 10,000 of them there. 
If they work well, he says, Toshiba will place a regular order, and Aerovox could end up shipping capacitors to a Toshiba microwave plant in England as well. 

   At Aerovox, a major U.S. maker of microwave-oven capacitors, John A. Churma, its vice president for sales and manufacturing, says he was surprised when Mr. Tanaka approached him about exporting to Japan. 
"We'd been romancing Toshiba {in Nashville} for about six years" before big sales started in 1986, he says. 
"I thought the Japanese market would be tougher to crack because of their entrenched manufacturing capabilities." 

   Mr. Tanaka can cite other successes. 
Late last year, as the yen rose, Toshiba took the unusual step of replacing its Japanese supplier of hard disk drives for computers with Memorex Corp., of Milpitas, Calif., and Kaitex Media Inc., of San Jose, Calif. 
Emboldened, Mr. Tanaka recently persuaded a top Japanese engineer to evaluate analog-digital converters made by Analogic Corp., of Peabody, Mass., even though Toshiba itself makes similar parts. 

   As Mr. Tanaka sees it, however, American vendors don't compete effectively with the Japanese. 
They don't treat Toshiba with the eager deference that he expects. 
"In the U.S., they say the customer is king. 
In Japan, the customer is God," he says. 
Most U.S. companies get business only if Toshiba decides to buy American -- not by outselling a Japanese supplier. 

   Mr. Tanaka also suspects that many U.S. companies really don't want to export. 
He notes that few write technical brochures in Japanese and that many haven't mastered high-tech export-licensing requirements. 
Vernon Alden, a director of several U.S. corporations, comments, "I don't think it's fair to blame the Japanese because they expect to have better service than we give. 
The problem is we have gotten sloppy." 

   Mr. Tanaka complains that some U.S. companies take six weeks to provide price quotes even on standard products. 
One concern refused to promise a delivery date until Toshiba placed the order -- a troublesome stand because Toshiba's Japanese plants keep inventories lean. 

   Last winter, a General Electric Co. transformer plant in Hickory, N.C., said it couldn't ship a small order when Toshiba demanded it. 
Mr. Tanaka asked to visit the GE factory to learn the reason. 
He says GE's reply was: If Toshiba left it alone, half the order would be shipped in a week; if Toshiba officials visited, it wouldn't be shipped at all. 
"This is 180 degrees opposite of Japan," he says. 
"They just don't want to hear our complaint." 

   A GE spokesman says the company quoted the same delivery times to all customers. 
He adds, "We got people to work overtime over Thanksgiving" to ship part of Toshiba's order early. 
But when Mr. Tanaka asked to visit, "We said, 'Please don't. 
It might cause a problem just having additional people be there.'" 

   Mr. Tanaka says a supplier that he won't name promised a circuit breaker with a special calibration but filled the $20,000 order with its standard model. 
Toshiba complained. 
The supplier said it would take six weeks to recalibrate. 
Instead, it offered to tell Toshiba engineers how to do the job. 
Desperate for the part, Toshiba agreed. 
But when its engineers asked for clarification of the instructions, Mr. Tanaka says, "The U.S. engineers complained we were wasting their time. 
They said we weren't an important enough customer." 

   To U.S. companies, Toshiba can seem picky and imperious. 
Analogic was proud when all 100 electronic instruments worked in its first shipment to Toshiba seven years ago. 
But Toshiba complained because some minor parts came loose. 
"We thought we'd performed a miracle. 
But they sat there and told me how inferior our products were," recalls Bernard Gordon, Analogic's president. 
Today, the companies' engineers meet quarterly in Tokyo and Peabody. 
"Their expectations of perfection rubbed off on us," Mr. Gordon says. 
Toshiba's orders to Analogic now run $5 million a year. 

   When Toshiba ordered a three-ton industrial burner from tiny Pyronics Inc. of Cleveland last year, Mr. Tanaka negotiated visitation rights during the 16-week building process. 
Moreover, says Nicholas LaGamba, a Pyronics engineer: "They demanded a manufacturing schedule from us showing graphically just where we'd be at each stage of production." 
That technique was new to Pyronics; so Mr. Tanaka taught the company how to do it. 

   Nonetheless, Mr. Tanaka complains that many U.S. suppliers won't invest the effort to fulfill Toshiba's expectations. 

   Mr. Tanaka is particularly frustrated by their reluctance to bid on projects that won't bring in revenue for several years. 
For example, his office is charged with finding U.S. vendors for a fuel-cell power-plant project, but getting bidders has been a grind. 
"They will cooperate and take instant business, but they aren't cooperating in future business," he says. 
He adds that small Japanese companies would eagerly do engineering work to bid on Toshiba projects but that American companies must be cajoled to do so. 

   One reason American vendors are cautious is the limited market for power from fuel cells, which efficiently turn chemical energy into electricity. 
Lee Ridenour, the Toshiba buyer seeking bidders for the fuel-cell project, says, "One thing that is scarce in the U.S. is quotation time and engineering time." 
Toshiba engineers in Japan, drawing up the bid requests, "were in a climate where they could ask suppliers to do work without pay," she adds. 
She says one U.S. engineer termed a 20-page request requiring about 100 pages of specifications and drawings "the Toshiba torture test." 

   And U.S. bidders say they are amazed by the study that Toshiba puts into each bid. 
Harry G. Abel, a power-industry specialist at Foxboro Co., a controls maker in Foxboro, Mass., says teams of six engineers went to Foxboro twice and also met with him in San Francisco. 

   "American engineers tend to spread themselves out over 10 or 12 projects," Mr. Abel says, but the Japanese "were dedicated to this." 
After all the work, Foxboro lost the contract to another U.S. company, he says. 
However, he hopes to get Toshiba business in the future.

When Cultures Clash:
Main Street Chiefs
Vs. Wall Street Pros

By Bryan Burrough</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Alan gaines knows he's the type of Wall Streeter that chief executive officers love to hate. 
He's the fast-talking head of an investment firm, lives in a Park Avenue townhouse, drives a Rolls-Royce and earns more than $1 million a year. 

   He also doesn't hesitate to tell America's CEOs how to do their jobs. 

   Two years ago, the youthful Mr. Gaines flew to Houston to tell Tenneco Inc.'s silver-haired chief executive, 56-year-old James Ketelson, to restructure the $15 billion oil conglomerate or risk a takeover. 

   "I walk into his office in Houston and Ketelson is like Mr. WASP, Mr. Proper. 
And here I am, a 32-year-old kid making more money than he does, telling him how to run his company. 
What would your reaction be?" 

   Neither Mr. Ketelson nor Tenneco will comment, but Mr. Gaines says the advice was spurned. 
Not that he was surprised. 
He's used to what he calls the "anti-investment banker, anti-New York, anti-little rich kid" attitude of big-company executives. 

   He in turn sometimes holds a disdainful view of Main Street."You go out to visit these CEOs who talk very slow, very deliberate. 'Well, sir-r-r, we're ve-ry interested in long-term valuuuue,'" mimics Mr. Gaines, the head of Gaines Berland Co. 
"I want to say, 'Come on, guy, spit it out. 
Talk. 
I want to get home by next year.'" 

   Main Street and Wall Street have always been miles apart. 
But the takeover fever of recent years, which has thrown together conservative corporate executives and a new breed of young, highly paid raiders and investment bankers, is driving the two cultures still further apart. 
The result is a symbiotic relationship often marked by deep clashes in everything from how they make deals and what they wear when making them, to how they spend their money. 

   "We have created a monster," declares Fred Zuckerman, Chrysler Corp.'s treasurer. 
"Main Street management believes that greed has finally won out. 
Executives hate the takeover folks, whom they view as having no useful purpose. 
They think even less of the investment bankers. 
It's genuine revulsion at a society that rewards people so greatly for work they perceive to be so unproductive." 

   The recent headline-grabbing spate of insider trading scandals only has widened the chasm. 
"There is a definite tension between corporate types and Wall Streeters," says Jonathan Rinehart, whose New York-based public relations consulting firm specializes in takeover-style crises, "and all this insider trading stuff is just dumping gasoline on the fire." 

   A recent example is the lawsuit by Staley Continental Inc., a food company, alleging that the investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. tried to pressure Staley management into a leveraged buyout. 
Drexel has called the allegation "totally without merit" and said the suit is "an ill-conceived attempt to capitalize on the current climate" created by the spate of insider-trading arrests. 

   These days even investment bankers fear Wall Street's young Frankensteins. 
"I find the whipper-snapper investment banker who's fresh from Harvard Business School and who's going to tell you how to run your company, just as tiresome as any other CEO," says Robert S Pirie, president and chief executive of Rothschild Inc. 
"These smart-aleck kids who have gotten bagged (for insider-trading violations) ought to go to jail for more than a year," he says. 
"Minus their toenails." 

   Along Main Street, here's how David Culver, 51-year-old former CEO of Amarillo, Texas-based Pioneer Corp., views Wall Street types: 

   "I'm sick of 'em all," he says. 
Mr. Culver developed his hostility last year when he sold out to crosstown buddy T. Boone Pickens after being overwhelmed by a phalanx of raiders and investment bankers. 

   Mr. Culver complains that in boardroom jousts his Wall Street opponents were so single-minded as to appear "programmed." 

   "First of all, they're not a damn bit smarter than me, no matter what they think," says Mr. Culver. 
Even more disturbing to him, the Wall Streeters seem concerned with little beyond money and their careers. 
"Our guys are much more family-oriented. 
They look forward to going home and playing with their children," Mr. Culver says. 

   "I was president of the Amarillo Club, in the United Way and Rotary," he continues. 
"We consider that important. 
When the Wall Streeter finally gets home, he's lucky to see his family, much less go down to the United Way and make calls." 

   It's still unclear where all the resentment will lead. 
But it could trigger a grassroots backlash of the type that toppled another generation of financiers: the robber barons. 
Politicians are already on the scent. 
"If you did to a 7-Eleven what (Wall Streeters) have done to the American economy, you'd be doing 20-to-life," said James Hightower, outspoken Texas agriculture commissioner, in a recent speech before national Democratic leaders. 

   Much of this boils down to simple difference in executive style. 
To the typical Main Street executive, Wall Streeters are fresh-faced MBAs in tailored suits and mallard-dotted suspenders who come to places like Bartlesville, Okla., and Akron, Ohio, only to put people out of work -- all the while mouthing terms like "break-up values" and "front-end loaded, two-tier tender offers." 

   In turn, many Wall Streeters seem to view their Main Street counterparts as slow-moving, boorish hicks. 
"The so-called sophisticates tend to be surprised when they find smart guys out there in the hinterlands," says Gary Hirsch, a 37-year-old principal in the New York investment firm of Miller, Tabak &amp; Hirsch. 
"They'll walk out of meetings and say, 'Gee, even though this guy is from Pennsylvania, he knows what he's doing.'" 

   Still, when Wall Streeters venture down Main Street, sometimes they feel like they're in a foreign country. 
During the unsuccessful visit to Tenneco's chief executive, Mr. Gaines found himself lunching "at some place with animal heads on the walls. 
It was like eating in the Baptist Club of Houston. 
I expected to have to say grace before sitting down. 
I mean, in New York I take people to Le Cirque," he says, referring to the famed French restaurant. 

   The difference in lunch style, though, often pales before the difference in lifestyle. 
Case in point is last November's visit by Robert E. Mercer, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.'s 62-year-old chief executive, to the Manhattan townhouse of Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French investor who then was trying to grab the Akron-based tiremaker. 

   According to a Goodyear associate, Mr. Mercer was taken aback when he knocked at what he thought was the correct address, only to be told by a smartly dressed butler that Sir James lived several doors down. 
Knocking there, the same butler opened the door, explaining to Mr. Mercer: "This is Mr. Goldsmith's home. 
That was the kitchen." 

   Once inside, the father of five found himself facing two statues of nude females and a myriad of paintings of nudes. 
Mr. Mercer, an associate says, hasn't yet tired of relating his amazement. 

   But it is in the boardroom where matters of style matter most. 
Nowhere was that more apparent than at Phillips Petroleum Co. in 1984, when Wall Street specialists arrived to help the Bartlesville oil company fend off a Who's Who of corporate raiders. 

   Phillips CEO William Douce and other officials occasionally would roll their eyes after lecture-like presentations by the investment bankers. 
Says Mr. Douce, now retired: "I don't mind those young people making a lot of money in a short time. 
But some of 'em speak as if they were God. 
Some of 'em think they may be God. 
I'll tell you a secret. 
Most of those fellows come in, listen to you and your people. 
Then they take your own ideas, dress 'em up a little and read 'em back to you." 

   Down in the Phillips public relations department, employees were equally put off by the New York firm hired by senior executives hired to manage the company's media campaign. 
Although a Phillips spokesman denies it, a person close to the company says the two sides fought over practically every word of every press release, at times to the brink of fistfights. 

   "There was the perception that the New Yorkers thought they had come down here to help the Great Unwashed," says a Phillips official. 
"Just because we don't eat at Tavern on the Green doesn't make us any less sophisticated." 

   When the culture clash between adversaries surfaces, it is enough to bring a heated takeover battle to a boil. 
That apparently was the case when, during Pennzoil Co.'s unsuccessful bid to acquire Getty Oil Co., Pennzoil's tough-talking chief executive, J. Hugh Liedtke, was host to Jay Higgins, then a 38-year-old Salomon Brothers investment banker who represented the Getty Museum, a major Getty Oil shareholder. 

   Mr. Liedtke asked several anxious questions about the museum's position on the pending merger, but Mr. Higgins kept silent, Pennzoil lawyer Arthur Liman recalled in recent court testimony. 
Suddenly, Mr. Higgins answered all at once: "Yes, sir. 
No, sir. 
Yes, sir. 
No, sir." 

   Mr. Liman, seeing his boss near explosion, quickly escorted the investment banker from the room. 
"Mr. 
Higgins did a number on Mr. Liedtke . . . a mocking of him. 
I just wanted to get him out of there," Mr. Liman testified. 

   Mr. Higgins, currently head of corporate finance at Salomon, denies mocking Mr. Liedtke. 
He says he wasn't entirely responsive to the executive because, at the time, he didn't want to divulge to Pennzoil the Getty Museum's position. (Getty Oil was bought by Texaco, a deal that could be undone by a so-far successful lawsuit by Pennzoil.) 

   But sometimes Wall Streeters know just how they come across. 

   The most offensive ones relish it. 
Others suggest that stereotypes, used craftily, can be turned to one's advantage. 
Confronting a potentially hostile Midwestern crowd, Daniel Scotto, a utility-bond analyst at L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, may opt for the Wall Street equivalent of full-body armor. 

   Outside New York, he says, "If I think I need an extra edge, you will find me in full garb -- my Brooks Brothers suit, my suspenders and my yellow tie. 
Other places, with friends, say, I'll switch to a softer approach. 
The light gray suit, blue shirt and blue tie." 

   Main Streeters can be just as canny. 
A common tactic might be called "the country boy ploy," a ruse some executives west of the Hudson use in an attempt to coax an opponent into underestimating them. 

   Before Pennzoil's court fight with Texaco over the Getty purchase, Mr. Liedtke -- one of the ploy's foremost practitioners -- portrayed himself as something of an oil-patch rube, a notable feat considering his diplomas from Amherst College and Harvard Business School. 
What effect the approach had on Texaco isn't known, but it certainly helped generate sympathetic media coverage for Pennzoil. 

   In any case, the $14 billion jury verdict in Mr. Liedtke's favor makes some Wall Streeters wary of self-proclaimed country boys. 
"Every time someone says, 'I'm just a country boy,' I check my money, button my pockets and give my wallet to my secretary," says Rothschild's Mr. Pirie. 

   There are tests to help discern Wall Streeters from Main Streeters. 
"I look for the gold Rolex," says Chrysler's Mr. Zuckerman. 
"Wall Street is populated with gold Rolexes and summer houses in the Hamptons. 
They never talk long before they start on about their summer house in the Hamptons."

                    A Matter of Perspective
   Are chief executives of major corporations more or less
ethical in their business practices today than they were 10
years ago? It depends which side of the desk you're on. The
Wall Street Journal asked CEOs that question in its survey on
executive style in January; and the same question was asked
in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News national poll of 1,576
people on Jan. 22 and 23. The answers provide startingly
different views.

<HL> Reasons Behind the Male-Female Pay Gap

By James D. Gwartney</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<IN> LABOR </IN>
<TEXT>
   The Economic Report of the President, released in January, contains an informative chapter on women in the labor force. 
It shows dramatic changes in the career choices of young women and the resulting changes in their earnings. 
The data suggest that women's nontraditional choices are accomplishing what the anti-discrimination laws of the 1960s and 1970s did not: shrinking the large earnings gap between men and women. 

   After stagnating for decades, the earnings ratio of women to men has been moving upward in the 1980s. 
The latest figures from the Census Bureau show that in 1985 women earned 65% of what men did. 
This compares with the 1960-80 period, when the ratio for full-time workers changed little, ranging from a low of 57% in 1972 to a high of 60%, which was reached several times during the two decades. 
This stagnation suggests that 1960s legislation prohibiting employment discrimination and in some cases mandating affirmative action did little to improve the relative earnings of women. 

   There are, however, sound economic reasons to question whether employment discrimination is the sole reason or even the primary one behind the male-female pay gap. 

   The very size of the earnings differential should give one pause. 
If an employer really could hire women willing and able to do the same work as men for 40% less, he would have a very strong incentive to do so. 
The average business earns a profit of 5% on total sales. 
Surely many employers would jump at the chance to cut labor costs by 40%. 
As more and more employers did this, the demand for women would expand. 
Women's earnings would rise and the earnings ratio would move toward parity. 

   A more convincing explanation for the differential lies in a married couple's traditional attitudes toward work -- attitudes that have persisted over a very long time, but show recent signs of change. 
Married men typically pursue paid employment aggressively when they are the family's primary breadwinner. 
To improve their earnings, married men are more likely than married women to accept transfers, pursue careers in which uninterrupted work experience is important, and accept jobs with long hours, uncertain schedules and out-of-town travel. 

   In contrast, women generally have had the primary responsibility for running households and caring for children. 
At least in the past, women have anticipated that they will interrupt their careers for various personal reasons. 
As a result, they tend to seek jobs with less travel and more flexible hours. 
They may also want jobs that will be available in a wide variety of locations so that if the family moves, they can enter the job market easily, with little reduction in earning power. 
Viewed in this light, it is not surprising that women have been attracted to nursing, teaching, secretarial and other jobs with easily transportable skills. 

   What evidence would support or contradict this hypothesis? 
Preferences cannot be easily measured, but we can compare the earnings of women relative to men according to marital status. 
The median annual earnings for full-time, year-round workers who are female and married are only 60% that of married men. (If part-time, married workers are included, the ratio is 39%.) 
When single women are compared with single men, however, the ratio rises to 90% -- a much smaller difference in earnings. 

   Similarly, single men working full-time earn only 62% as much as married men. 
The logical conclusion is that a man with a wife to bear the greater share of their family responsibilities has more time to devote to his job, and the flexibility to adopt uncertain schedules or change locations, increasing his earning power. 

   Evidence is emerging that more and more women now plan for a long-term continuous attachment to the labor force, rather than merely intermittent periods of employment. 
The president's economic report this year says that among a national sample of young white women in 1979, 72% expected to be working at age 35, up from only 28% in 1968. 

   There also has been a dramatic change in the educational choices of women. 
Today, more women are preparing for high-skilled, high-paying professions. 
As recently as 1971, only 7% of the law degrees and 10% of the accounting degrees were earned by women. 
In 1985, however, women earned 38% of the law degrees and 49% of the accounting degrees. 
Similar changes have taken place in other professions, including medicine, architecture and engineering. 
Of course, these changes will exert their primary impact in the future, as women now entering the professions and planning for a more permanent attachment to the labor force acquire experience and move up job ladders. 

   However, as the recent evidence indicates, these trends are already making a difference. 
Paradoxically, at a time when many feminist leaders consider the political environment hostile, women's choices of occupation and work force attachment are propelling the relative earnings of women upward at last.

How to Make Business History --
A Look at Tomorrow's CEO Hall of Fame:
The Stars, the Forgettables, the Footnotes

   Twist the television dial or pick up one of the blizzard of glossy business magazines and there's a corporate chieftain staring back. 
Sometimes it seems top executives get as much air time and ink these days as rock stars. 

   But will that fame endure? 
Which leaders of corporate America will live in memory like the Beatles or Elvis? 
Which will vanish like Moby Grape or Marianne Faithfull? 

   Business history is studded with figures of enduring fame. 
Henry Ford turned the automobile into an empire. 
John D. Rockefeller created the first oil trusts. 
Alfred Sloan shaped the idea of a modern corporation. 
Andrew Carnegie made his fortune in steel and devoted his life to philanthropy. 
Villains aren't in short supply, either -- railway magnate Jay Gould caused the "Black Friday" panic with his speculation in gold. 

   But trying to identify the Henry Fords, Alfred Sloans or Jay Goulds of the 1980s isn't easy. 
In search of answers, we made an unscientific and impressionistic survey, asking management professors, business historians, financial journalists and management consultants which chief executives will be remembered. 

   What chief executives do they think MBAs of the class of 2037 will study? 
Who will future managers admire and emulate? 
Or excoriate? 
What emerges is a list of men who, in the eyes of these observers, have had an impact beyond their own corporations and industries. 

   The list is short. 
While these observers find many chief executives praiseworthy, they predict few will be remembered. 

   Here then are the contemporary executives business observers believe will still be talked about after the 21st century rolls around. 

   -- The Leaders
   Walter Wriston is the only consistent nominee. 
"He belongs on anybody's list," says Thomas Horton, president of the American Management Association, a nonprofit group. 

   A champion of deregulation, Mr. Wriston will be remembered for his role in moving the staid banking industry into more complex financial services, those surveyed predict. 
At Citicorp, where Mr. Wriston was chairman through August 1984, he moved the bank holding company from concentrating on corporate lending into consumer banking. 

   The choice of Mr. Wriston reflects observers' feelings that to be remembered, one has to change more than just a company. 
"He did more to change the banking system than anyone else," says Mr. Horton. 

   Mr. Wriston also is first choice because of his role as business statesman. 
"He's extraordinarily literate, persuasive and forceful," says John Jeuck, professor of business history at the University of Chicago's business school. 
"Clearly he's one of the handful of industrial statesmen of this generation." 

   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca is often mentioned too, but for mixed reasons. 
Some think he will be remembered for his role in getting government loan guarantees to help bail out Chrysler. 
"He not only turned around a company headed out of existence, but tended to take a stronger position on the appropriate role for government in helping out industry," says David Lewin, professor at Columbia University's business school. 

   Others think Mr. Iacocca will be remembered for his personality and his role in popularizing business. 
"He turned the faceless CEO into a cult figure," says management consultant Thomas J. Peters, co-author of the book "In Search of Excellence." 

   But Mr. Iacocca may be remembered less than the social and political forces that surrounded him, many say. 
"The real book on Iacocca isn't written yet," says Paul Tiffany, a business historian at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. 
"What saved Chrysler was a thing called quotas." 

   Edward Bowman, professor of management at Wharton, says, "Iacocca could be in some professor's textbook 50 years from now as an example of government-business involvement. 
Maybe as a footnote." 

   To many, this is the era of the entrepreneur. 
They believe that the people who will be remembered are those who, like Henry Ford, Montgomery Ward or Harvey Firestone, built companies from scratch. 
Frederick Smith at Federal Express Corp. is a popular choice. 
"He represents the epitome of entrepreneurship," says Jim Farley, senior chairman of the consulting firm Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. "History will remember Federal Express and that a guy had an idea and (made it work) against imposing odds. 
He created a new form of distribution." 

   The importance of a new industry will underscore the importance of the indvidual, says James Brian Quinn, a professor of management at the Amos Tuck School at Dartmouth College. 
"When you stand in the year 2000, and look back on three decades, the technology that will stand out . . . will be biotechnology." 

   "Bob Swanson is the single most prominent name as a CEO in that business," Mr. Quinn says. 
Robert Swanson, Genentech Inc.'s founder and chief executive, turned Genentech into a major drug maker, with such products as genetically engineered insulin and the experimental drug Interferon. 

   Computers changed the world, too, but many feel that even the best known computer entrepreneurs, such as Steven P. Jobs, former chairman of Apple Computer Inc., will be forgotten. 
"Jobs won't be remembered," says Edward Bowman of Wharton. 
"He's a flash in the pan." 

   Others think Mr. Jobs will be remembered as a symbol of a new executive type. 
"Steve Jobs won't be forgotten," says Harold J. Leavitt, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University and author of "Corporate Pathfinders." 
"He's the children's crusader, a young man with contemporary values and young attitudes. 
He's a kind of a cult leader." 

   Some say the real guiding lights aren't known yet. 
"We are waiting for the second Sloan, but he won't appear in an industrial company," maintains J.P. Donlon, editor of Chief Executive magazine. 
"He will appear in a service industry." 

   -- The Dismantlers
   Many contend that the 1980s will be known for mergers and acquisitions, and corporate raiders such as Saul Steinberg, Carl Icahn and T. Boone Pickens will be remembered. 
"These people are the ones who will be recalled 40 or 50 years from now as the robber barons of old," says Mr. Tiffany, the business historian. 

   Mr. Jeuck of the University of Chicago compares the rash of mergers and acquisitions of the 1980s with the turmoil of late 19th century American business -- in reverse. 

   "At the end of the 19th century there was a whole epidemic of trust-building and pyramiding of trusts and holding companies, and the whole Rockefeller-Jay Gould era of consolidation of American industry," he says. 
"This is in a different direction. 
It's a disintegration process." 

   -- Rogues
   In business as elsewhere, there's more than one way to acquire a lasting reputation. 
"I picked DeLorean because he was an entrepreneur with a lot of flair," says Stanford's Mr. Leavitt. 
He notes that John Z. DeLorean's bid for enduring fame got some unwanted boosts: "Being arrested will help. 
Anything that gets (people) into the media will help." 
Mr. DeLorean, whose automobile company went into receivership in 1982, was acquitted of cocaine smuggling charges and later acquitted of charges that he diverted company funds for his own use. 

   Many agree that a brush with the law can win a place in history. 
So for Wharton's Mr. Bowman, a candidate for lasting fame is Ivan Boesky. 
He believes Mr. Boesky's agreement to pay $100 million in settlement of insider trading charges will survive in memory after the less-sullied reputations of others have faded. 

   Theodore Levitt, editor of the Harvard Business Review, says, "The things that are remembered are things of rascality and notoriety because they become metaphors and symbols," and he predicts that our age one day will be called "the Boesky era." 

   -- Outsiders
   Our survey specified chief executives of American corporations. 
But some experts said they wouldn't play unless we changed the rules. 
To them, the business leaders Americans are most likely to remember are Japanese. 

   "What do you do when they are producing in the U.S.?" asks David Lewin, professor of business at Columbia's business school. 
He nominates Akio Morita, chairman and chief executive at Sony Corp., which has five manufacturing plants in the U.S. 
In a new, multinational environment, says Mr. Lewin, top business leaders are top business leaders wherever you find them. 
"These are pace-setting companies. 
We are learning lessons from those abroad." 

   Mr. Quinn at Amos Tuck says, "The guy who deserves world mention and will clearly be recognized by his country and by the world is Konosuke Matsushita, who founded Matsushita Electric Industrial Co." 
He adds: "When you hear Japanese mangement style referred to, very often the model is Matsushita." 

   -- Nobody
   "I'll be damned if I can come up with anybody," says John Gallagher, senior lecturer in business policy at the University of Chicago's business school. 

   It's not that he didn't try: Mr. Gallagher questioned two classes of students, totaling 110 people, and circulated the question informally at "three or four" meetings of boards he sits on. 
"Everyone says 'Duh . . .'" he reports. 

   The key, he says, is the anonymity of corporate work. 
The people who are remembered are founders, the people who have their names on the door. 
Today corporations are bureaucratic, he says. 
Even entrepreneurs are surrounded by a crowd of venture capitalists, investment bankers and regulators. 

   "Since Thomas Watson Jr., IBM has been run by a sea of faceless people," he says. 
"I couldn't give you the name of the current president of Xerox or IBM if my life depended on it. (Steven) Jobs . . . (is) hardly known now, much less 50 years from now. 
Will Roger Smith be famous 50 years from now? 
Hell, no." 

   Management expert Peter Drucker agrees: "Chief executives . . . are rarely remembered and rarely worth remembering. 
They are servants."

<HL> Stadium Projects Are Proliferating
Amid Debate Over Benefit to Cities

   In the beginning was the playing field, and it was good. 

   Then came television and agents and, most of all, big money. 
And somewhere between Chicago's ancient Comiskey Park and the ultramodern Superdome in New Orleans, the playing field evolved into the enclosed, multi-use stadium, a symbol of civic vitality linked not only to baseball and football but to politics and economic development as well. 
Along the way, acquiring a stadium became one of the most fiercely fought games in sports. 

   At present, some 20 North American cities are each gambling $100 million or more that a new or renovated stadium will lure or keep a coveted sports franchise. 
A wide range of people are involved, including team owners, architects and a flotilla of legal, financial and political specialists, who scrap for consulting jobs that barely existed a decade ago. 

   But amid the action, questions abound. 
Will there be enough teams, tractor pulls and trade shows to keep all the stadiums from racking up huge deficits? 
How will the new tax law affect financing and the boom in luxury seating, which is helping to fuel many of the ventures? 
And most fundamentally, who ultimately will pay for the stadiums -- and who will benefit? 

   Supporters of the ventures frequently argue that, even if a stadium loses money, the community benefits from the development it attracts and the jobs it creates. 
Moreover, they contend, each dollar spent at the stadium ripples through the economy -- the so-called multiplier effect -- as it is spent and re-spent. 

   Critics counter that the true beneficiaries are team owners, who usually wind up with favorable deals either to relocate or stay put, while losses generally wind up in the taxpayer's lap. 
Robert Baade, an economics professor at Lake Forest College in suburban Chicago who has studied stadium economics, asserts that jobs created by stadiums are largely temporary (construction) or low-paying (service), and that the multiplier effect can be illusory. 
Typically, he notes, money spent at sports events isn't new, but is shifted from another activity, such as family entertainment. 
In seven of nine cities he studied, the city's share of regional income actually declined after a new stadium was built. 

   The New Orleans Superdome, which opened in 1975, illustrates both sides of the debate. 
On the one hand, the lavish facility ended up costing $163 million instead of the original estimate of $45 million, and it has run up some impressive deficits -- as much as about $12 million annually from 1977 to 1980. 
But it has also sparked an estimated $5.5 billion building boom and made New Orleans a regular stop on the Super Bowl rotation -- which means an estimated $100 million economic infusion every four or five years. 
"It was the deal of the century," says Glennon Walsh, a stadium designer with St. Louis-based Sverdrup &amp; Parcel and Associates Inc., which took part in the Superdome's construction. 

   Perhaps, but Prof. Baade believes much of the development would have happened anyway. 
Also, not all stadiums have inspired such development, and some cities -- particularly colder, northern ones -- wouldn't get a Super Bowl no matter what kind of facility they built. 
"You may bring in business, but offsetting that is the operating deficit," says Bruce Bingham, a consultant with Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. in New York. 
"If budgets are strained and you have to raise taxes, you're shooting yourself in the foot." 

   Indeed, threadbare public budgets have forced developers to finance creatively, and have given rise to the latest buzzword in stadiums: "privatization." 
Though most stadiums still rely heavily on public money, private sources of revenue are playing a greater role. 

   Consider Toronto's plan: $30 million from municipal taxes, $30 million from provincial lottery proceeds and $5 million each from 15 corporations buying the rights to such things as supply contracts, advertising, parking spaces and use of the stadium logo. 
Individuals can contribute by purchasing up to $15 million of sponsorship tiles on the stadium's "Wall of Fame," or some $15 million of preferred shares that may be issued publicly. 
Revenue could also come from a proposed 450-room hotel attached to and owned by the stadium, and, of course, from luxury boxes. 

   Luxury boxes, which have gained immense popularity among stadium developers, are a major element in most privatization plans. 
These enclosed seating arrangements, usually featuring such amenities as couches and television sets, lease for up to $50,000 a year. 
Often used to entertain business clients, they can help pay off debt service, provide added revenue for team owners and sharply reduce or eliminate government subsidies, making stadium projects more palatable politically. 

   But privatization based on luxury boxes depends largely on the market. 
"You have to have a team that people will kill to see," as well as enough businesses with a need to entertain important customers, says Larry Greenberg, a stadium consultant with Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Minneapolis. 
And under the new tax law, he adds, future stadium projects won't be able to use tax-exempt bonds for financing; thus, cash-flow requirements in private developments will rise. 
New deductability rules may also slow demand for luxury boxes. 

   Mr. Bingham of Peat Marwick fears, too, that an overabundance of stadiums will strain the supply of special events needed to cover expenses. 
"Dark days," he says, referring to the times when a facility isn't booked, "are death." 

   Naturally, sports-hungry cities believe promoters will fill the need for events, that teams can be lured and that local businesses will always buy luxury boxes, regardless of team quality or tax deductability. 
Why else would St. Petersburg, Fla., and San Antonio, Tex., among others, be pursuing stadiums so ardently? 

   Last November, St. Petersburg broke ground on an $85 million domed baseball stadium despite a sobering letter from Peter Ueberroth, the sport's commissioner. 
"We interpreted that letter as saying that if you're thinking that by building a stadium you'll get a team faster, please be aware that won't be the case and you might never get it," says Robert D. Obering, the city manager. 
The city, still confident it can win a major-league team, hopes that until it does it will be able to book 100 days of conventions annually, as predicted by its marketing consultants. 

   Critics claim, however, that St. Petersburg lacks enough hotel rooms to support the conventions (though Mr. Obering believes the stadium will encourage construction of more.) 
And the city also faces competition from another stadium project across the bay in Tampa. 

   In San Antonio, Jim Eskin, executive director of San Antonians for a Domed Stadium, sees new jobs and a booming tourist trade through his "macroeconomic binoculars." 
But San Antonio, a small market that hasn't supported sports teams well in the past, hasn't yet surveyed interest in luxury boxes, a significant part of the financing plan. 
Nor has the city been prominently mentioned as an expansion candidate by either professional baseball or professional football. 

   Mr. Eskin insists that his city has been overlooked because it doesn't have an adequate stadium. 
"This is a make-or-break year," he says. 
"There's a footrace to get teams, and if we don't get cracking we'll fall further behind." 

   For both cities, this is risky. 
"You have to have at least one franchise, or a virtual monopoly on events in your area," for a stadium venture to work, says Marc Ganis, a partner in Sportssuites Inc., a New York-based builder of stadium additions. 

   Whether the issues surrounding stadiums are resolved or not, development fever could cool soon if interest rates rise sharply or if sports leagues find a way to restrict franchise relocations without running afoul of antitrust laws. 
Moreover, the special arrangement under which the cities currently considering stadium projects can continue using tax-exempt bonds expires in 1990. 
"The party's certainly going to slow down" by then, says Mr. Greenberg, the stadium consultant. 
"I'll probably have to find something else to do."

   N.V. PHILIPS, citing narrowing profit margins, said it plans to reduce the labor force at its small-appliance facility in Drachten, the Netherlands, by nearly 16% over the next three years. 
The reduction would cut 300 jobs, many of them white-collar, from the 1,900 positions at the facility, where the bulk of the Dutch company's Philishave and Norelco brand electric razors are made. 
Philips's profit margins have been eroded by the weak dollar, which has reduced the amount of guilders produced by sales denominated in the U.S. currency. 

   UNDERWOODS PLC and WOOLWORTH HOLDINGS PLC said they ended talks about Woolworth's possibly acquiring the drugstore chain. 
The two companies said only that the decision represented a "mutual and amicable agreement." 
Earlier this month, they said they couldn't agree on terms, but discussions continued. 
London's stock exchange began a probe of trading in Underwoods after a big shareprice jump occurred before it disclosed merger talks with an unidentified party last month. 
Underwoods later said that Woolworth, a retailer that isn't related to the U.S. company of the same name, was the suitor.

Cut From CEO Cloth:
A Dollop of Dullness, a Brace of Purdeys
And a $1,000 Suit Outfits You for the Top
---
By James P. Sterba</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>

<TEXT>
   You see it daily in the corridors of corporate America: the would-be chief executive officer committing the classic eager-beaver boo-boo. 
He comes to work early, stays late and conducts after-hours chicanery, if any, with the discretion of a George Smiley. 

   For lunch, he starts nibbling nail-bed regimens of rabbit food at his desk. 
His dark-blue tie stays taut. 
His shirt -- one of those colored jobs with white collar and cuffs -- stays buttoned. 
Sometimes his dark-blue suit coat stays on all day. 

   With a new, paternal smile, he starts acknowledging hallway colleagues with a measured, low-decibel "Nice to see you." 
Mail starts getting answered like this: "Thank you for your (pick one) kind/generous/thoughtful/engaging note," instead of like this: "I thought I knew the depths to which stupidity could be measured, but your letter . . . ." His bad breath miraculously stops. 
Hair growing out of his ears disappears. 

   You'll want to keep an eye on this turkey, because he's eventually going to make your life miserable. 
What's happened? 
Somebody from upstairs has pulled him aside and whispered the chromosome-altering words: "One day, son, all this could be in your hands." 

   It won't be, of course. 
His highest title will be vice president in charge of serious. (Somebody's got to do it). 
He's peaked too early. 
He's gotten dull too soon. 

   You have to get dull in stages, shedding just enough humanity, whimsy, collegiality and sartorial eccentricity with each promotion to exhibit a bit more of the progress, maturation and fine-tuning required to comfort (or sedate) board members and shareholders. 
As a fast-rising underling, you want to excite. 
As a CEO, you want to soothe. 

   This reverse metamorphosis from flash-and-trash butterfly to well-turned-out worm is a delicate maneuver that requires perfect timing and a devotion to greed strong enough to overcome the mental torture associated with going bland. (If you own your company and don't have to grovel to bankers and investors, forget this part.) 

   We aren't talking about executive style here. (Incidentally, men's fashion designer John Weitz, who wrote "Man in Charge" and lunches with tycoons a lot, says that in today's takeover-ravaged corporate America, CEOs rarely last long enough to develop their own style. 
Ousted CEOs, on the other hand, have a definite style. 
"It's extraordinary how they shrivel and slouch," Mr. Weitz says. 
But that's another story.) 

   What we are talking about here is packaging -- that expensive game of visual trickery long associated with the Cheshire cat and annual reports. 
Both sexes can play, though experts say the aspiring female CEO will have to spend at least 50% more on packaging than her male counterpart to achieve prudent levels of blandness. 

   All this is especially perilous at the moment because you're climbing the ladder in the middle of a slight uptick in flamboyance -- bright hankies (pocket squares), suspenders (braces) with frolicking nudes, tie bars, that kind of stuff. 
As always, ascent rates depend on looks, not deeds (though for men, marrying the boss's daughter remains a strong move). 

   So forget about hard work, innovative thinking, the bottom line and the rest of the stuff in this report. 
This is the straight poop. 
We've consulted the oracles of corporate fashion, read the how-to books, scoured the magazines and ads ("Introducing DeRigueur, for the man who has learned to wear his income properly.") 

   We've even attended a "dynamic Executive Wardrobe Engineering seminar," conducted for $2,500 by Lois ("Dress for Excellence") Fenton. 
This is the same seminar Ms. Fenton gives for the troops at Drexel Burnham Lambert, so she is obviously the real power behind junk bonds. (For $900 a day, she'll go shopping with you, too.) 

   Dash out and buy yourself the proper writing implement: a Mont Blanc Diplomat fountain pen (List: $265) is fine; the same model in solid gold ($6,500) is a bit much. 
And take good notes. 

   Basics first. 
Columnist Dave Barry, author of the seminal work "Claw Your Way to the Top," says it best: "Basically, the American businessman should dress as though he recently lost his entire family in a tragic boat explosion." 

   This is neither cheap nor easy. 
Furthermore, CEO candidates aren't just business executives. 
They're would-be titans. 
They can't be just average. 
They have to mold the basic dull look into their own fashion statement and pay exorbitant sums to achieve it. 

   You can't get away anymore with a dark blue suit, white shirt and dark blue tie. 
It says you're playing it safe. 
It makes board members suspicious. 
You can't get away with being what the trade calls "fashion forward," either. (That means wearing togs designed by guys whose names end in vowels.) 
It says you're playing it unsafe. 
It makes board members suspicious. 

   Men have a primordial fear of dandyism. 
Potential CEOs have to pretend they don't care about clothes. 
They must keep their preoccupations with mirrors in the closet. 
And if you don't think they know about mirrors, how do you explain the stock market? 

   The basic problem (beyond the fact that American men usually wear pants that are too short, scruffy shoes, short-sleeved shirts and things colored purple or green) is dumb suits. 
Unless you're paying a grand or so for your dark blue or grey caulk stripe, you may as well punt. 

   The safest suit in America (price range: $875 to $1,295) is made in Chicago by Oxxford Clothes Inc., whose chairman, Jack McDonald, humbly explains: "We aim it at the power structure of the United States. 
We aim to separate the men from the boys." 

   Says designer-author Alan Flusser (whose own tailor-made suits sell for $895): "Wearing an Oxxford is like wearing molded air, it's so soft. 
It actually feels like what it costs. 
It's better than 99% of the custom-tailored suits in the world. 
But in my opinion, it's designed for a guy who wants to feel great in a suit yet has no sense of aesthetics whatsoever." 

   Custom-made suits: Besides Mr. Flusser, there's Morty Sills, also in New York, and Savile Row. 
You can do all right in Hong Kong (cheap buttons are a dead giveaway) if you're smart. 
It's kind of like shopping at Brooks Brothers -- okay, but you want to try to avoid being seen doing it. 

   Dark blue, gray, striped or solid, and tan. 
Not dark brown. 
If you think Ronald Reagan is in trouble with Americans because of his Iran-Contra fiasco or deficits, think again. 
Our sartorial sleuths say it's because he wears dark brown suits. 

   Shirts: Paying through the nose is the best policy. 
Custom-mades by Turnbull &amp; Asser (London) can skirt dandyism. 
Paul Stuart (New York, Tokyo) sells made-to-measure shirts for from $58 to a seemingly hefty $130 each because, among other things, their "cuffs have a personal relationship to the wrists they encircle." 
Any shirts that have personal relationships seem highly desirable to us. 

   "You will never, ever, as long as you live, wear a short-sleeved shirt for any business purpose," wrote John T. ("Dress for Success") Molloy. 
This is nonsense if you live in San Diego, says Mr. Weitz. 

   Watches: The way science education is going in this country, it may soon be a sign of intellectual prowess to be able to tell time on an analog. 
So you want a watch with hands, not digital displays. 
That chunky Rolex diving watch that James Bond and JFK popularized in the '60s, Mr. Weitz notes, was made to say: "Stay down here at 140 feet for another four minutes, and a meteor storm of nitrogen bubbles will soon make cottage cheese out of your brain." 
If you want to say that around the office, wear one. 
If your brain is already cottage cheese, wear the solid gold version. 

   Footwear: People who wear scuffed shoes are communists. 
Period. 
People who wear dumb shoes are Japanese businessmen. 
If you want to know why having all the money doesn't bring Japan respect, look at Japanese feet. 

   Best off-the-shelf shoes in America are at, of all places, Brooks Brothers. 
They're British-made. 
So, of course, are good Church's. 
Our man, surely, needs custom-made. 
And that means John Lobb, the legendary British bootmaker. 
But when somebody asks, "Aren't those Lobb of St. James?" you say, "Oh, heavens no. 
Lobb of Paris, of course." 
Older, more experienced shoemakers there, Mr. Flusser points out. 

   In any case, dip into your children's education fund. 
Lobbs cost around $500 each. 
No, not each pair. 
Each foot. 
Note: White shoes are fine, if you're aspiring to be CEO of a company selling pre-owned Oldsmobiles in Podunk. 

   Ties: There is nothing wrong with spending $50 for a necktie. 
When some ties start costing $100, however, you'll have to throw all your $50 ties away or risk looking cheap. 

   Please, no ties that tell a story, like the one we own that shows Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dancing. 
Says Ms. Fenton: Ties need names, like foulards. 
Our paced-incremental-dullness formula dictates that whatever gewgaw patterns you have on your foulards (diamonds, crowns, pheasants, dots, baby sharks, whatever), do this: With each major promotion, buy new ones on which the gewgaws are one size smaller. 
Men who wear dark blue ties with microscopic pin dots are called "Sir" a lot. 

   And only buy silk. (For that matter, never wear any clothes made out of petroleum, only things made by sheep, plants or worms). 

   Colors: For people who actually produce a tangible product, dark blue, burgundy and power red are in. 
Wall Street money shufflers can still get away with yellow (very 1985). 
Pink is still around, but avoid it if your company makes a product with more than three moving parts. 

   Bow ties are making a bit of a comeback. 
But would you trust Arthur Schlesinger or George Will to be your CEO? 

   Leisure: You need to start practicing now so you won't show up at the fox hunt in bluejeans. 

   Tennis, running and sweat sports are exercise, not leisure. 
Golf should be considered work and thus conducted during working hours. 
True leisure starts with a Thomas &amp; Thomas catalog. 
You need a fine Tonkin bamboo or old Leonard flyrod, a reel by Ross, Hardy or Michel Pezon and custom-made Ranger waders (trout can be trite unless you go to Bhutan or New Zealand for them, but Labrador and Norway salmon never are). 

   To demonstrate they aren't averse to bloodletting at the helm, CEOs must appreciate sedate blood sports (not dog-fighting, dummy). 
Thus the need for shotguns. 
Purdeys, of course, or Holland &amp; Holland. 
A brace. 
While you may think that sacrificing your child's education is a high price to pay for $40,000 worth of shotguns, just remember: There is nothing more telling than a man with a single Purdey. 

   If death disturbs you, shoot clay pigeons. 
Just keep it to yourself. 

   Dogs: Two or three Chinese sharpeis for the wife are okay. 
But your dogs should do what dogs were made to do: hunt, point and retrieve, not roll over or chase some dumb ball. 
A stubborn Chesapeake Bay retriever or American water spaniel will do. 
Borzois, mastiffs -- we don't know. 
If you need a dog for protection, you live in the wrong neighborhood to be a CEO. 
For children: any old expensive mutt. 

   And a yacht. 
But, pul-eeze, refer to it as a boat.

<HL> February Outlay
By Consumers
Increased 1.7%

Personal Income Rose 0.9%;
Auto Sales Climb Fueled
Rebound in Spending

   Consumer spending jumped 1.7% in February after a sharp drop the month before, while personal income rose a healthy 0.9%, the Commerce Department said. 

   The increase in spending followed a 2% plunge in January, the sharpest since the department began keeping the figures in 1959, and a revised 2.4% surge in December. 
The December rise was previously reported as 2.2%. 

   The income increase followed a 0.2% rise in January. 
The figures were affected by several factors, including subsidy payments to farmers and a pay raise for federal workers. 
Excluding such factors, income increased 0.6% in February and 0.3% in January. 

   Much of the February rebound in spending reflected higher auto sales, partly in response to dealer incentives. 
Also, car sales had fallen sharply in January after surging in December as consumers sought to beat the Jan. 1 repeal of the sales-tax deduction. 

   Despite the February spurt, many economists contend spending will decline or will change very little for the quarter. 
Consumer outlays fell in the fourth quarter. 

   "This was a rebound from extremely depressed levels," said Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. in New York, who predicts that spending will show a drop for the quarter. 
Although he expects outlays to gain moderately in the second quarter, he contends that growth will be constrained by low consumer savings levels. 

   Last month, the savings rate fell to 3.6% of after-tax income from 4% in January. 

   Spending on durable goods, which are intended to last three years or more, rose last month after falling in January. 
Spending on nondurable goods and on services increased in both months. 

   On income, the department said the farm subsidy payments affected both the January and February figures, while the pay raise for federal workers occurred in January. 
Also affecting the January data were cost-of-living adjustments and changes in the contribution levels for Social Security and other programs. 
The changes included increases in the taxable wage base for Social Security and in the monthly premium for supplemental medical insurance. 

   Even accounting for these factors, several economists characterized the latest rise in income as robust, saying it reflected the strong employment figures of recent months. 
"It's the outsize increases in employment we've been having," said Richard Peterson, senior vice president at Continental Illinois National Bank in Chicago. 

   But he added that some of that strength may be attributable to unseasonably warm weather that buoyed construction employment. 
Income gains may be smaller in the months ahead, he said. 

   Wages and salaries rose 0.8% in February after a 0.6% rise the month before. 
Factory payrolls increased 0.5% after a 0.4% advance. 

   For the second month in a row, unusual factors distorted disposable income, the amount of money people had available to spend. 
In February, there was an increase in withheld federal income taxes partly reflecting the adjustment by individuals of their tax withholding to reflect the new tax law. 
In January, withholding had been reduced, partly because many people hadn't made the adjustment and were having too little taken out of their paychecks. 

   There was a drop in estimated tax payments in February, however, following an increase in January, when people were trying to compensate for insufficient withholding. 
State and local tax payments fell in February. 

   In listing these items, the department cautioned that estimates of tax payments at this time of year are based on fragmentary information and are subject to larger revision than usual. 

   The income and spending figures are adjusted for seasonal variation, but not for inflation. 
A spending-based price measure reported after a one-month lag rose 0.8% in January after increasing 0.3% in December. 

   The February rise in outlays brought them to a $2.856 trillion annual rate from a $2.807 trillion pace in January. 
Income increased to a $3.581 trillion rate from a $3.549 trillion pace. 

   Here is the Commerce Department's latest report on personal income. 
The figures are at seasonally adjusted annual rates in trillions of dollars.

   Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. said it agreed to sell its majority stake in Amtech Corp. to Blockbuster's chairman, David P. Cook, and president, Kenneth W. Anderson. 

   Blockbuster also reported its net loss widened to $2.9 million for 1986. 
In 1985, the loss was $326,000, which included profit from discontinued operations of $625,000. 
Revenue soared to $8.1 million from $119,000 last year. 
Blockbuster, which operates and licenses video rental stores, said that $954,000 of its 1986 deficit was attributable to its Amtech investment. 

   Amtech is developing an electronic identification security system, which Blockbuster says isn't compatible with its video rental business. 
Blockbuster said Amtech also would require substantial additional funding to develop and market its product and is expected to continue incurring operating losses for the foreseeable future. 

   Messrs. 
Cook and Anderson plan to form a new company, Amtech Holdings Inc., with Mr. Anderson, 55 years old, as president. 
Mr. Anderson resigned as president and as a director of Blockbuster, reducing its board to five. 
He has agreed, however, to continue as a consultant to Blockbuster, the company said. 
Mr. Cook, 31 years old, will assume the additional post of president. 

   The company declined to disclose terms of the sale of the Amtech interest, but said it would not result in a gain or a loss. 

   Blockbuster shares fell $1.25, to $20.50, in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.

<HL> Free Police From the Shackles of 911
---
By Lawrence W. Sherman</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   A coup d'etat has taken over American policing. 
Gradually, with little public notice, police managers have lost control over how officers spend their time. 
The usurper is the telephone. 

   According to at least one police chief, 911 runs the police department. 
Most police effort is directed simply on the basis of telephoned citizen requests for immediate service. 
This system is neither rational nor democratic. 

   Sgt. Bud Emerson of the Minneapolis Police Department has an experimental weapon to cut down on chronic calls to 911, something no other police department has. 
This weapon, a computer printout, lists the handful of addresses that generate the most crime in Minneapolis. 
The list includes the 500 addresses (out of 172,000 in the city) that produced 23% of all the robberies, 15% of all the rapes and 19% of all the assaults and disturbances in 1986. 
The list, produced by the Crime Control Institute in Washington, D.C., also shows that a mere 5% of all the addresses in Minneapolis produced 64% of all the calls for police service. 

   Sgt. Emerson and the four officers in the Minneapolis Police RECAP (Repeat Call Address Policing) Unit have another weapon in very short supply: time. 
Because other officers are responsible for answering the 911 calls the RECAP Unit is analyzing, RECAP officers have time to study the list and examine the types and times of calls at each address. 
They have time to talk to the owners, managers and residents of the most active addresses, to diagnose the problems and to seek solutions. 
And they have time to follow up on the problems to make sure the solutions are working, or to try other approaches that will work better. 

   Police have known for years that crime is more concentrated in some parts of a city than in others. 
But it was not until the National Institute of Justice sponsored the RECAP project that it became clear just how concentrated crime is. 
For even in a high-crime area, most addresses never suffer the crimes that generate calls for police service. 
Patrolling just as much at those addresses as at the high-crime addresses may well be a waste of time and money. 

   Police also have known that they get many repeat calls at certain addresses. 
With the growth of 911 systems, such calls have increased, and police spend more time at these most active addresses than at other locations. 
But it is not "quality" time. 
Their responses must be brief and superficial, given the time pressures they are under to respond to still other repeat-call locations. 
Such "reactive" policing, as Yale University's Albert Reiss calls it, keeps putting out the fire but never takes away the matches. 

   Minneapolis Police Chief Anthony Bouza, chairman of the Crime Control Institute, agreed to help test the Institute's RECAP plan as part of his commitment to the new philosophy of "proactive" policing, under which police take greater initiative in analyzing and selecting the crime problems they will attack. 
Repeat offenders, narcotics pushers, drunken drivers and corrupt congressmen (in Abscam) have all been the focus of such proactive efforts in recent years. 

   While critics of proactive policing find "Big Brother" overtones in such efforts, they probably would find much of the RECAP Unit's work innocuous. 

   One address on Sgt. Emerson's list, for example, showed almost daily burglar alarms at 5:30 a.m., consistently false. 
With different officers handling the calls, no one ever noticed the pattern. 
But once RECAP officer Skip Goodmanson looked into it, he found that a newspaper delivery crew was throwing a stack of newspapers off the truck and up against the front door, setting off the alarm. 
A conversation with the delivery crew solved the problem. 

   Another address on the list was a skid-row mission, which generated repeated calls because of drunks they had expelled smashing the windows and breaking in the door. 
RECAP advised the mission to get shatterproof plexiglass windows and a steel door. 

   But RECAP is also attacking serious crime. 
After meeting regularly with the owner of a chronic-call apartment building, RECAP officer David Martens learned that there was a large drug-selling operation in one of the apartments. 
His information helped the Narcotics Unit get a warrant to make the largest heroin seizure in that city in recent years. 

   The landlord of another building examined the RECAP printout to see which tenants generated most of the calls for domestic disturbances, noise complaints and other problems. 
On the basis of the printout, he said he would try to evict the tenants generating chronic problems. 

   This raises the question of whether the police in a free society should be in the business of getting people evicted, or even providing information to landlords that may have that effect. 
In Minneapolis, a call to the police is a public record and there is no legal basis to deny anyone access to such information. 
If evictions can help deter future problems, then police should not discourage landlords from taking such actions. 

   Most of the businesses on Minneapolis's RECAP list have been surprised to discover just how many police dispatches are directed to their locations. 
But with a few exceptions, they have been very cooperative in trying to find ways to reduce repeat calls. 
Number one on the list, a large discount retail store, had 810 calls last year, the bulk of them for police to do paper work on shoplifters who had already been apprehended. 
In consultation with Sgt. Emerson, the store decided to hire off-duty police officers to book the shoplifters at the store's expense. 

   Perhaps the least cooperative group has been bar owners, one of whom would not even return phone calls from RECAP. 
Some of the bars on the list have substantial problems of violent crime. 
RECAP has ideas for how the bars can reduce such crime (such as not admitting or not serving intoxicated customers). 
But if a bar doesn't cooperate, the RECAP officers can use their printout to argue that the bar's liquor license should be revoked. 

   This "problem-solving" RECAP strategy is only one way of dealing with the concentration of crime at a few addresses. 
In addition, traditional police methods, such as foot patrols, decoys and the presence of police cars, might be much more effective if they were concentrated at the high-crime addresses. 
Municipal budget cutbacks require police to do what the National Institute of Justice's director calls working smarter, not harder, to fight crime.

Design Problems Remain

<TEXT>
   David Alexander and his computer are making sure that baseball fans at the stadium under construction in St. Petersburg, Fla., will get a good view of the action. 

   An architect with Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum Inc., the project's designer, Mr. Alexander can call up an overhead plan of the stadium and then zero in on a specific section and seat. 
The computer does the rest, displaying in seconds what used to take hours to calculate -- the location's view of the field. 

   Such advances as computer simulation are helping architects to anticipate and correct many of the kinds of problems that have cropped up in the past: seats stuck behind thick columns at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium; lights at Minneapolis's Metrodome that make every fly ball an adventure; gales that do the same at San Francisco's Candlestick Park, perhaps the world's largest unintentional wind tunnel. 

   But ideal solutions to some basic problems remain elusive. 
And with so much money and community pride at stake, there is considerable pressure on designers to find ways to get it right. 
"The multi-use stadium is the civic icon of the late 20th century," says Philip Bess, a Chicago architect. 
"It's the equivalent of a cathedral, proof in the citizens' minds that they're world-class cities." 

   One problem architects are wrestling with is the awkward marriage between the rectangular gridiron and the baseball diamond. 
Plans for a Phoenix, Ariz., stadium address this with a design in which the end-zone stands and two wedged-shaped sections between the 10- and 20-yard lines can be pulled out, allowing the remaining stands to swing together. 

   To be truly flexible, enclosed stadiums must be usable for basketball, hockey and concerts as well. 
But such versatility adds special requirements. 
Because stadiums have so many seats, for example, basketball fans typically don't feel pressed to buy season tickets, an important source of team revenue. 
And basketball teams like a more intimate, rabid atmosphere than the stadiums allow, architects say. 
Thus, some new designs feature moveable stands and false walls and ceilings that reduce the 60,000 or more stadium seats to 20,000 or fewer. 
Architects are also simulating intimacy with sound-reflective panels. 

   Roofs have long been a headache. 
Early, hard domes necessitated round stadiums for support -- an inconvenient shape for both baseball and football. 
And critics snipe that they cost too much, leak and create a cavelike atmosphere. 
Seattle's concrete Kingdome is "depressing," says Ronald Turner, an architect with Howard Needles Tammen &amp; Bergendoff. 
"If you have a choice of going sailing or going into the dark kingdom, you'll go sailing." 

   Air-supported fabric roofs, often made of Teflon-coated fiberglass, seemed to be the answer. 
They cost an average $9 million (about half as much as hard domes) and let some sunlight in -- as much as 30% with newer fabrics. 
But heating costs are high, and fabric domes can collapse in winter if snow-melting machines fail. 
Air pressure is another problem: At the Hoosierdome in Indianapolis, for example, only a few doors can be opened at a time or the roof will deflate. 
And patrons are propelled out the exits by 45-mile-an-hour winds. 

   Enter the cable-supported fabric dome, which with insulation costs an average $13 million -- still about a third less than hard shells. 

   Designs for Phoenix, Cleveland, Toronto and San Antonio, Tex., include the latest wrinkle in domes: retractability, which satisfies baseball fans' craving for sunshine and football fans' need for warmth. 
Phoenix's fabric dome will cost an estimated $13 million; Toronto, with an especially complex concrete design, will shell out $90 million, according to some projections. 
But not everyone raves about retractables. 
"Some (proposed designs) won't work, and some will cost considerably more than projected," says David Geiger, a New York-based dome designer. 

   Before he died last year, John Waterbury of Iffland Kavanaugh Waterbury P.C., designers of Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles and Shea Stadium in New York, produced perhaps the most radical idea for a multi-use stadium. 
What if you laid the baseball field on top of the football field? he wondered. 
Then, when baseball season ended, the entire field could be lifted mechanically and hooked to the second deck, forming a domed football stadium. 
So far, nobody has embraced the plan. 
But, says Jerome Iffland, the firm's president, "someone will steal our idea eventually. 
It's a concept that's got to be used."

Newsprint Prices 7%

   Abitibi-Price Inc., the world's largest newsprint producer, said it plans to boost prices for standard newsprint sold in the U.S. by 7%, to $610 (U.S.) a metric ton from $570, effective July 1. 

   The move by Toronto-based Abitibi-Price comes at a time of tightening newsprint supplies world-wide and just prior to the start of labor negotiations involving 30,000 unionized workers and more than 20 eastern Canadian paper producers, including Abitibi-Price. 

   "It's a disappointment and a surprise," Homer Taylor, president of Scripps-Howard Supply Co., a Cincinnati-based unit of Scripps-Howard Newspapers, said of the planned price increase. 
Most newspaper chains hadn't budgeted for a price increase before Oct. 1 because they believed producers would first want a contract settlement, he said. 

   But Robert Johnson, senior vice president of Abitibi-Price Sales Corp., a New York-based Abitibi-Price unit, said there isn't any link between the price increase and the labor talks. 
"We view these as two separate situations," he said. 

   Mr. Johnson said the price increase is "driven by needs to improve our return on investment." 
Abitibi-Price, which is a unit of Gulf Canada Corp., and other major Eastern Canadian producers raised newsprint prices by 6.5% in October, the first increase since 1984. 

   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday Abitibi-Price closed at $42.25 (Canadian) a share, up $1.25. 

   Guy Dufresne, senior group vice president at Montreal-based Consolidated-Bathurst Inc., another big newsprint producer, said his company is "studying the situation," noting that "supply is tightening and demand is continuing to grow." 

   A spokesman for Great Lakes Forest Products Ltd., Thunder Bay, Ontario, called Abitibi-Price's plans "good news" but said the company hasn't any plans at the moment for a price increase. 

   Earlier this week, Vancouver-based MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. announced a 7.5% price rise for its U.S. customers, also effective July 1. 
With discounts taken into effect, its new price will rise to $552.90 (U.S.) a metric ton from $514.43. 

   MacMillan Bloedel sells primarily to consumers in the western U.S., where prices have been lower in recent years, while Abitibi-Price sells primarily in other regions. 

   Industry observers say the price increases come at a time of tightening newsprint supplies world-wide. 
Aggravating the situation was an earthquake earlier this month in New Zealand that has halted output at a large newsprint mill operated by Fletcher Challenge Ltd. 
The closure is expected to result in diversion of some Canadian newsprint to Australia and Southeast Asia. 

   The Canadian Paperworkers Union last week selected Abitibi-Price as the target company in contract talks with eastern Canadian paper producers. 
The union represents about 4,700 workers at 10 Abitibi-Price mills in Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland. 

   The union is seeking a 7.1% wage increase in the first year and 8% in the second year of a two-year accord. 
The current average wage rate is $14.10 (Canadian) an hour. 
Formal talks are set to begin April 21.

   British unemployment fell to a seasonally adjusted 11.1% of the labor force in February from 11.3% in January, the Department of Employment said in a provisional report. 

   The decline in the number of unemployed was the biggest ever. 
February was the seventh consecutive month in which the number of jobless declined. 

   Before seasonal adjustment, the department said, the jobless rate stood at 11.7%, down from 12.1% a year earlier. 

   Lord Young, Britain's employment secretary, said unemployment had fallen by nearly 150,000 people since last July. 
"There appears little doubt now that the monthly fall, which has been running at about 20,000, will continue," he said.

   DEP obtained the rights to the Doan's product line, which also includes a backache spray and a pain reliever, in December when it acquired Jeffrey Martin Inc. DEP said distribution of the Doan's line represented annual revenue of about $14 million -- mainly from the pills. 

   DEP also said it plans to sell the remaining over-the-counter drug business obtained through the Jeffrey Martin acquisition. 
Ciba-Geigy Corp. is a unit of Ciba-Geigy Ltd. of Switzerland.

   It happened in prime time last night, a national TV broadcast pitting two of the greatest powers in American life in what had been pre-billed as virtually a death struggle. 
The White House press corps vs. 
Ronald Reagan? 
Of course not. 
We're talking about something really important -- Syracuse vs. 
Florida in the NCAA Eastern basketball regional. 
We sensed the relative importance of these two titanic cultural events on reading yesterday that six of CBS's seven Florida affiliates decided to can the president's 8 p.m. news conference and instead broadcast the Gators' basketball game. 
We suspect the president probably wasn't upset with Florida last night. 
The state had its shot at Mr. Reagan in 1984, pouring in nearly 65% of its votes for him. 
Last night they had a choice: Watch air ball in Washington or basketball in the NCAA. 
An easy bucket.

To Avoid Dispute

   The British government's surprise decision to sell its remaining 32% stake in British Petroleum Co. appears designed to raise needed revenue while avoiding controversy in advance of this year's expected national election. 

   The sale also will likely further postpone the sale of state-owned concerns -- such as Britain's water authorities -- that have been viewed as likely candidates for denationalization. 

   As previously reported, Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government said Wednesday it plans to sell its BP stake, currently valued at the equivalent of more than $7.5 billion, in the year ending March 31, 1988. 
Although the Tories earlier had indicated they planned to eventually sell the BP shares, few industry analysts expected the sale so soon. 

   Receipts from the sale would help the government stay on schedule in its recently accelerated denationalization program, under which it plans to sell assets valued at $8 billion in each of the next three years. 
The government sold assets valued at $20 billion during its first eight years in office. 

   At the same time, the sale should be less controversial than the denationalization of an entire state-owned business. 
Last July, the government postponed plans to denationalize the country's water industry after some managers resisted the move and workers threatened lawsuits. 

   "With an election coming, BP is noncontroversial," said Andrew Bain, an economist at Midland Bank PLC. "Nobody is going to be uspet" with the government for selling its remaining shares in the company. 

   The Treasury said yesterday that selling its stake in BP, which owns 55% of Standard Oil Co. of the U.S., will probably push back the sale of other state assets. 
That's because the $7.5 billion that the sale would generate almost meets the government's goal of selling $8 billion of assets annually. 

   Britain's water industry, electric utilities and British Steel Corp. have been among the candidates most often mentioned as denationalization targets. 

   The Treasury yesterday said the sale of the BP shares already had been taken into account in the budget, unveiled Tuesday, for the year starting April 1. 
That means the sale won't lead to further tax cuts or reduce government borrowing. 

   The government said the BP sale would be "subject to market conditions," but it didn't specify how or when the shares would be sold. 
The sale presumably is contingent on the Conservative Party's winning the next election. 
The election must be held before June 1988 but is expected sometime this year. 

   The sale is expected to have little effect on BP itself. 
The company said it welcomes the sale because it "will clear up a number of uncertainties which have affected both the market's attitude to BP and our own financial planning."

   Rolls-Royce Posts Profit
   LONDON -- Rolls-Royce PLC, the state-owned aircraft engine maker, reported record profit for 1986, thereby polishing its image just weeks before the government sells it to the public. 

   The company said net income rose 56%, to the equivalent of $192.4 million from $123.5 million in 1985. 
Sales rose 13%, to $2.89 billion from $2.57 billion. 
Its civil-engine sector, where operating profit increased 88% to $219.7 million from $117.1 million, was the major contributor to the improved results, the company said. 

   The public offering, to occur in late April or early May, is expected to raise more than $1.6 billion. 
Rolls-Royce no longer has any relation to the car maker with the same name. (The car maker has been a Vickers PLC unit since 1971.) 

   To keep the strategically important company in British hands, the government will limit foreign-held shares to 15% of the total. 
It also will require government approval for disposals of more than 25% of the company's assets or significant assets used for the nuclear business. 

   The government rescued Rolls-Royce from bankruptcy in 1971. 
Since then, the company has cut its work force almost in half, tightened up financial controls and improved productivity.

   James Communications Inc. said it retained Waller Capital Corp., an investment banking concern specializing in cable television, to sell the closely held cable company. 

   James, based in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., has about 100,000 subscribers in systems in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Iowa. 
At current market prices, which range as high as $2,000 a subscriber, the company could fetch $180 million to $200 million, investment banking sources said. 

   James was formed in late 1985 by William R. James, formerly president of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s cable television division, and a group of institutional investors.

   Every frequent air traveler can recite horror stories about interminably delayed or abruptly canceled flights. 
The Federal Aviation Administration reports that a record number of flights were delayed last year at the nation's 22 busiest airports. 
The reasons for this post-deregulation mess are complex, but there is little question that it adds up to major frustration for air travelers. 

   This week the FAA has been taking another run at the extreme flight congestion that builds up around "peak" hours, or the day's most popular travel times. 
Meeting in Washington with more than 100 airlines, the agency is trying to arrange adjustments in summer flight schedules at seven of the more congested airports, such as Newark, Chicago's O'Hare and Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport. 

   The airlines participated in the FAA-initiated talks with great reluctance. 
The carriers complained that coordination of schedules among rivals is inherently anti-competitive (as the Department of Transportation acknowledged by virtue of Secretary Elizabeth Dole's offer of antitrust immunity to the airlines), and only a step removed from re-regulation of the airline industry. 
Moreover, airline executives say, the FAA's actions are only a temporary solution. 

   In fact, similar discussions among the airlines in 1984 yielded only short-term results. 
Schedule changes lasted six months and during that period delays were down. 
But when airlines adjusted their schedules to respond to increased consumer demand for certain flights, delays increased. 

   There are two quick-fixes for this problem. 
The airlines can stifle demand by raising fares, or the FAA can exercise its authority to restrict the number of flights particular airlines may offer at given times. 
The hot competition among airlines makes fare-raising unlikely, so that leaves an FAA-decreed solution. 
It is this possibility that worries the airlines. 

   Similar concerns were raised in a memorandum the FAA solicited from the Federal Trade Commission. 
The FTC said the FAA's action "is likely to harm both competition and consumers." 
It also warned that although the airlines were granted antitrust immunity solely to discuss scheduling, some might take advantage of the opportunity to collude on fares and service in individual markets. 
Another prospect, the FTC warned, is that the FAA's action ultimately might result in arbitrary cancellation of flights greater in value to consumers than some retained. 

   Now, in the middle of this mess, FAA Administrator Donald Engen has announced that he's quitting this summer out of frustration over pressure on the agency's budget and pressure from the Reagan administration to auction landing rights among the airlines. 

   We have argued here before that one good way to achieve less airport congestion and fewer flight delays is indeed to ration the most desired landing slots by price. 
The FTC's memorandum advised that the FAA "impose additional limits on the number of slots during peak periods at the affected airports as needed," and that the agency then permit carriers to buy and sell the restricted slots. 
Under such a rationing system, airlines would pay a premium for peak-hour landing slots (currently, there is no price differential for peak and nonpeak slots). 
The airlines would likely pass this premium on to peak-hour travelers. 
Some would eventually opt for non-peak flights rather than pay higher peak-hour fares. 
Airport congestion would eventually abate. 

   These problems notwithstanding, Americans have benefited greatly from deregulation of the airline industry. 
More people are flying to more destinations at lower fares than even the most optimistic deregulators could have imagined in 1978. 
The challenge now is to create an air-travel management system appropriate to the level of consumer demand that obviously exists in the U.S. 

   The impediments to such a system are formidable. 
Airports tend to be viewed as public utilities. 
Expanding their capacity runs smack into local rules governing land use, noise, flight patterns, curfews. 
Debate drags on over privatizing air-traffic-control systems. 
Large, small and new airlines fight among themselves over proposed changes. 
In this atmosphere desperate people start grasping at re-regulation as the answer. 

   Re-regulation, however, is like saying there are too many cars, so let's go back to the horse-pulled trolley system. 
It won't happen. 
The crowded airline schedule is a problem requiring a large good-faith effort from both private and public parties. 
For the near term, the FAA will serve as a catalyst in this process. 
With Donald Engen's decision to leave the agency, the Reagan administration has an opportunity to give the job to someone who has the instinct, skill and authority to give air travelers the same market benefits on the ground that they are now getting in the air.

The Strange Story of a Drug
Regarded as Hero and Villain

   THE EPISODE WAS the kind that makes grist for novels and movies. 
A 40-year-old man suffering a severe liver disease had suddenly developed a life-threatening skin condition. 

   "His skin was sloughing off all over his body," recalls Marshall M. Kaplan, the Tufts University gastroenterologist who had been tending the patient's liver problems. 

   Cortisone wasn't helping, "so the question came up whether methotrexate would help," Dr. Kaplan says. 
Methotrexate is an old anti-cancer drug that had been found to aid certain other skin conditions, but it also has a dangerous side effect -- liver damage. 
The idea of using this drug in a man with a diseased liver was "frightening," Dr. Kaplan says. 
"But if we didn't use it, there was a good chance he would die from the skin condition." 

   Balancing the risks, doctors began giving the man methotrexate. 
"We watched his blood tests (for signs of liver damage), fully expecting them to get worse," Dr. Kaplan says. 
Instead, not only did his skin condition clear up, but to the doctors' astonishment, his liver began to improve. 
Now, eight years later, he takes maintenance doses of methotrexate, and both his skin and liver are normal. 

   THIS EPISODE, recently published in Annals of Internal Medicine, marks another serendipitous incident in the strange history of methotrexate. 
In these days when genetic engineering and molecular manipulation turn up new wonder drugs almost weekly, methotrexate stands out as a baffling technological anomaly. 
In the 40 years since the drug was first synthesized, it has been alternately lauded as a treatment for a variety of human scourges and castigated as a poison whose risks are greater than the diseases it's being used to treat. 
Yet no one is quite sure how or why it does what it does. 

   The methotrexate story begins in the mid-1940s when the late Sidney Farber and his colleagues at Children's Hospital in Boston were attempting the first use of chemicals in the treatment of acute childhood leukemia, then an invariably fatal blood cancer. 

   The cancer researchers, according to an oft-told story, had noticed a similarity between the leukemia and a certain anemia which was due to a deficiency of the vitamin folic acid. 
This led them to treat the leukemia with folic acid. 
To their horror, the folic acid accelerated the leukemia instead of retarding it. 
This near-disaster, however, led them to try a second chemical, called aminopterin, that blocked the cancer cells' use of folic acid. 
In 1948, in an historic research paper, the Boston researchers reported the first remissions of acute leukemia through chemotherapy. 
Unfortunately, the remissions lasted only a few weeks or months. 

   The Boston discovery led chemists at Lederle Laboratories, the pharmaceutical subsidiary of American Cyanamid Co., to synthesize an improved version of aminopterin they called a-methopterin, to which Lederle's marketing people affixed the brand name, Methotrexate (the brand name has since slid into generic use). 

   METHOTREXATE PROVED even better at bringing about remissions of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and today it is one of the drugs achieving cures of leukemia in about 50% of afflicted children. 
By 1956, cancer researchers reported another first: Women developing an unusual cancer of the placenta during pregnancy had been permanently cured by methotrexate, the first cancer ever cured by chemotherapy. 

   In the early 1960s, serendipity struck again. 
A New York dermatologist reported instances of some patients being relieved of psoriasis, a chronic and severely disturbing skin disease, when treated with methotrexate. 
This led William O'Brien and Roger Black at the National Institutes of Health to run a controlled trial on 21 psoriasis patients. 
Not only did the skin disorder clear up in several patients but so did a type of arthritis that often accompanies psoriasis. 
The scientists then reported a second trial showing that methotrexate produced remissions in some patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the most common form of the crippling disorder. 

   But, in treating psoriasis patients, the dangers of methotrexate became apparent. 
In high doses and daily use, the drug can cause severe liver damage and sometimes a lung disorder. 

   IN SOME CANCER PATIENTS, doctors have worked out a unique "rescue" concept, giving a patient dangerously high doses of methotrexate to kill cancer cells and then shortly afterward administering an antidote to save normal tissues from its poisonous effects. 

   Methotrexate's use in arthritis, at least for patients whose disease isn't helped by any other drug, is now being revived. 
Researchers have treated several hundred arthritis patients with low doses of methotrexate given only once a week. 
Anywhere from half to two-thirds of these patients improve; some have remissions of their arthritis. 
But while many arthritis specialists are using methotrexate in "refractory" patients, others shun it. 
One is Dr. O'Brien, who did the first trial of methotrexate in arthritis and who is now a professor at the University of Virginia. 
Because of its toxicity, he says, "we don't use it anymore here in Charlottesville." 

   Meanwhile, in Boston, Dr. Kaplan and his colleagues say they had a second patient with the same severe liver disease as the first but without the skin problem. 
"He was at his wits' end," Dr. Kaplan says. 
"I thought of that first patient and said, 'If you're a gambler and you want to try methotrexate, we'll do it.'" 
The patient's liver is now normal. 
A clinical trial of methotrexate in the liver disease, called primary sclerosis cholangitis, is now under way.

Power to Override Loans at the IADB

   The Reagan administration is headed for another confrontation with Latin American debtors over its year-old effort to overhaul the Inter-American Development Bank. 

   When members of the 44-country lending organization gather in Miami this weekend for their annual meeting, the U.S. again will seek changes that effectively would give Washington the power to veto proposed IADB loans to member countries. 
Washington argues that as the organization's largest donor it should have such say, but Latin countries oppose the idea as politically intolerable. 

   While neither side expects to resolve the dispute, each will be able to air views they have been expressing for some time in private, occasionally pushing negotiations into a more serious phase. 

   There is quite a bit at stake for the 27-year-old development bank. 
The Reagan administration has promised that if the organization's members agree to the changes Washington is proposing, the U.S. will help finance a major expansion of lending resources to $20 billion over the next four years -- enough to make the institution a serious player in the effort to resolve the global debt problem. 
If the members don't go along, Washington will contribute only enough to support $11 billion in new lending during that period. 

   U.S. policy makers complain that the bank often grants loans for political reasons rather than on economic merits. 
They also contend that the bank's largely Latin staff isn't tough enough about compelling borrowing countries to correct deficiencies in their economic policies. 

   For the bank to assume a larger role in resolving the debt problem, U.S. critics say, it will have to become more like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund, which usually insist that borrowing countries take specific steps to overhaul their economies before granting them new loans. 

   According to U.S. officials, the IADB's inadequacies stem from one basic flaw in the bank's charter: the borrowing countries themselves control the distribution of funds. 
Unlike other international lending organizations, where weighted voting systems give the contributing countries a clear majority, the Inter-American Development Bank assigns 54% of its voting power to Latin countries. 
The U.S. has another 34.5% and the rest is split among 15 other donor countries. 

   As it currently takes at least a 50% vote to halt an IADB loan, the Latin countries can guarantee approval simply by voting as a bloc. 
Washington wants to change the bank's rules so that loans could be turned down by just a 35% no vote. 
That way, the U.S., joined by any other industrial country, could veto loans it finds objectionable. 

   IADB staffers dispute criticisms that the organization is too lax, contending that Washington shouldn't try to force all other countries to follow the U.S.'s own economic model. 
"There are many ways to development, not just the one that's in use here in the U.S.," says one official of the Washington-based organization. 

   Still, U.S. and Latin American negotiators have made substantial progress toward resolving their differences. 
The Latin Americans have agreed over the past several months to a spate of U.S. demands -- to earmark 25% of the bank's loans to help countries restructure their economies, rather than for specific projects such as dams and roads; to channel a larger share of the total to the four big debtors, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela; to tie project loans to long-range economic restructuring programs; and to develop new procedures to coordinate the bank's loans with those of the World Bank. 

   But the dispute over veto power has proved more thorny. 
Latin governments, loathe to give up an historic prerogative, are willing to reduce the veto threshhold to 40% of the vote, but they say it would cost them too much politically to accede to the full U.S. demand. 

   Most are under pressure at home to be more aggressive in standing up to the U.S. on economic and financial issues. 
Brazil's recent move to suspend interest payments on commercial bank loans has only revived regional pressures to defy creditors. 

   Moreover, other donor governments aren't supporting Washington's veto demand. 
Only Canada has offered even lukewarm backing. 

   Following lower-level negotiations tonight and tomorrow morning, Treasury Secretary James Baker is scheduled to address the bank's annual meeting, which begins formally on Monday. 
Treasury officials say Mr. Baker is likely to reiterate the U.S. position. 

   Both sides are running out of time to resolve the dispute. 
The bank is about to exhaust its current four-year operating budget and will need more funds. 
U.S. negotiators say the Reagan administration will have to decide within a few weeks how much Washington actually plans to contribute to the organization's support. 
"We're down to brinksmanship," a U.S. negotiator says.

   Little more than a year ago, the people of the Philippines showed that faith could move dictators as well as mountains in the near bloodless ousting of Ferdinand Marcos. 
That was in response to a call from Jaime Cardinal Sin, archbishop of Manila, to go into the streets to protect the soldiers in rebellion. 
Today, with democracy restored and important elections due, the cardinal has told nuns and priests to go back to their churches. 

   The cardinal's call came on the heels of the capture of one priest with New People's Army rebels in Mindanao and the filing of weapons charges against another on Panay Island. 
These in turn followed a statement earlier that week by the respected head of the Filipino armed forces, Gen. Fidel Ramos, that the church had been infiltrated by communists. 

   To those who remember the cardinal's dramatic call for action during the revolution, his concern about a politicized religious community might seem an about-face. 
In fact his is an eminently orthodox position. 
Against liberation theology, which sanctions an activist clerical role in state affairs, the cardinal's emphasis is on the pastoral, involving the church directly only when the situation has gone beyond legitimate parameters or no other option exists. 
But with Marcos gone and Filipinos free to determine their future, Cardinal Sin sees no reason for his clerics to usurp the layman's role in sorting out the particulars. 

   Thus the cardinal and his bishops have issued new guidelines to rule out the extremes and prevent abuses. 
Membership in groups advocating "class struggle or violence as a means to social change" is unequivocably forbidden, and priests are banned from running for or holding civil power without special permission. 
If they are to minister to people of all persuasions, the church must be -- and be seen to be -- above politics. 

   The argument therefore is not against a politically concerned church but a politicized church. 
The difference between the two is best illustrated by two other Catholic nations. 
In Nicaragua, priests are part and parcel of an anti-democratic ruling junta. 
In Poland, by contrast, the clergy prefers to spell out principles and exert influence through lay leaders. 
It's no coincidence that one produces a Miguel d'Escoto and the other a Lech Walesa. 

   We're not arguing that priests and nuns should be deprived of their civil rights. 
Nor for that matter does Cardinal Sin, whose guidelines reaffirm the clergy's right to vote for whomever they want. 
We are concerned, however, that too often in North and South America and in Europe clerics have used their automatic status as religious leaders to push highly ideological, wholly secular agendas. 
There may still be a spiritual mission in there somewhere, but one would be hard put to identify it. 
What is especially noteworthy about Cardinal Sin's actions in the Philippines now is the extent to which they reflect a subtle clerical intelligence, sensitive to balancing both the public and spiritual needs of his followers.

   Guinness PLC said it is suing Ernest Saunders, its former chairman and chief executive, and U.S. lawyer Thomas Ward, a Guinness outside director, to recover an $8.3 million payment for consulting work the British brewer says was never done. 

   A Guinness official said the company filed a writ in High Court in London against Mr. Saunders and Mr. Ward seeking the return of a payment made to Marketing &amp; Acquisition Consultants Ltd., or MAC, an offshore concern in the English Channel island of Jersey. 

   Guinness directors also have asked shareholders to remove Mr. Saunders and Mr. Ward from the board at the company's annual meeting on May 27. 

   Earlier this month, Guinness tried to recoup the money by suing MAC in Jersey. 
That lawsuit alleged that Mr. Saunders and Mr. Ward had breached their corporate fiduciary duty by authorizing the payment. 
MAC last week claimed in court documents that the payment covered legitimate services performed for Guinness by Mr. Ward. 

   Yesterday, a statement by Mr. Ward's attorneys said the $8.3 million is "in his possession on deposit in the United States" less amounts used to pay taxes "and certain expenditures." 
The statement also contended that Guinness had refused his offer to put the money in escrow or to arbitrate his right to the money. 

   Mr. Ward's relationship with MAC isn't clear. 
But MAC previously was designated to receive some legal fees that Guinness owed Mr. Ward, Guinness sources have said. 

   Mr. Ward, a partner in the Washington, D.C., law firm of Ward, Lazarus, Grow &amp; Cihlar, declined to comment on the writ. 
David Aufthauser, Mr. Ward's Washington attorney, said: "The legal action seems to relate to the press release" about Mr. Ward's possession of most of the money. 
Mr. Saunders didn't return repeated telephone calls. 

   The MAC payment was part of $38 million that Guinness has said was disbursed possibly to help share buying in support of its successful $3.8 billion bid for Distillers Co. last year. 
The British government is investigating whether Guinness's shares were illegally propped to help it win the mainly stock bid.

Cut Output Close to a Record Low Level

   Saudi Arabia has cut its oil production close to a record low level in the battle to keep oil prices up, according to oil industry sources. 

   Saudi production has fallen to about 2.5 million barrels a day, down nearly a million barrels a day from a month ago and close to its lowest-ever daily output of two million barrels in August 1985, say sources among major U.S. customers for Saudi oil. 

   Oil production by most other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, including Qatar, Nigeria, Iran, Libya and Algeria, has also fallen. 
But the strongest source of resistance to oil company pressure to sell oil below the OPEC-mandated price of $18 a barrel seems to be Saudi Arabia. 

   "Saudi Arabia's King Fahd is by far the most prominent of OPEC leaders in the front line," notes Petrostrategies, a Paris-based trade publication. 
"In all its 25-year history, this episode of resistance and sacrifice is by far the strongest demonstration of solidarity by OPEC," the publication's editor, Pierre Terzian, says in an interview here. 

   OPEC and industry sources confirm that the cartel is producing a little more than 14.5 million barrels a day, compared with an authorized OPEC ceiling of 15.8 million barrels a day. 

   Contributing to the shortfall appears to be unanimous OPEC resistance to sales of crude below the official price. 
Accidental interruptions of production, such as the earthquake that has halted Ecuador's entire oil output of 210,000 barrels a day, also have held down output. 

   Reliable sources said tiny Qatar hasn't been able to sell more than 65,000 barrels a day of an authorized OPEC quota of 285,000 barrels a day for the month of April. 
But a senior Qatari official, who asked not to be identified, said the country nevertheless will hold against all pressure "because this is the political decision." 

   As a result, OPEC members are quickly devising plans to help their weaker members market oil in case the oil companies' challenge continues to erode their patience. 
Kuwait is reliably reported to be preparing to market Qatar's oil through its vast network of refineries and distributors in Western Europe. 

   "OPEC certainly seems to have a winning hand at the moment," says Steve Turner, an oil analyst with Wood, McKenzie &amp; Co., a brokerage firm in Edinburgh, Scotland. 
He shares with other analysts and industry observers the view that OPEC's low production and high resolve are forcing oil companies to run down their oil inventories sharply. 

   Some analysts think the drawdown is running as high as 3.5 million barrels a day. 
Such a rate would eventually ease pressure on OPEC by forcing buyers to pay official prices to replenish supplies. 
"If OPEC gets through March they are out of the woods," adds Mr. Turner.

   Assets of the nation's 379 money market funds rose $43.4 million to $237.34 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade association, said. 

   The gain was the fourth in five weeks. 

   Assets of 196 general purpose funds fell $245.6 million to $62.49 billion, and assets of 92 broker-dealer funds dropped $176.7 million to $108.79 billion. 
Assets of 91 institutional funds gained $465.7 million to $66.06 billion. 

   The average seven-day yield for funds, in the week ended Tuesday, rose to 5.39% from 5.35% a week earlier, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. 
The average 30-day yield for funds rose to 5.36% from 5.34%, and the average maturity of funds fell to 43 days from 44 days. 

   Banks, which compete with money funds, were paying an average yield of 5.15% on their money market savings accounts in the week ended Wednesday, unchanged from the week before, according to Banxquote Online, a New York-based information service. 
Bank yields were 5.66% for six-month savings certificates of deposit, compared with 5.65% the previous week. 
Yields were 5.88% for one-year bank savings CDs, compared with 5.87%.

   Eurodollar bond prices closed slightly higher, erasing earlier losses, as floating-rate notes rose for the third consecutive day. 

   Fixed-rated dollar issues were unchanged to 1/8 point higher, mainly in response to a slight early rise in some U.S. Treasury bond prices and bargain-hunting. 
Turnover remained thin. 

   "The markets have been very quiet, and they're probably going to remain that way until Treasurys get a little more volatile," said a trader for one major U.S. investment bank. 

   Floating-rate notes posted gains for the third day in a row. 
Some U.S. bank issues were half a point higher, while sovereign issues were up marginally. 

   But volume remained thin, according to specialists. 
There were some retail orders, but most trading involved professionals. 

   The only major new dollar-denominated issue appeared to have found strong demand. 
Nomura International Finance PLC launched $150 million of 7 1/4%, five-year Eurobonds via Nomura International Ltd. 
The bonds are guaranteed by the parent company, Nomura Securities Co., and carry a triple-A rating by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.

   Seagram Co. posted a 19% increase in net income for its fiscal fourth quarter, as profit from spirits and wine operations rose sharply from depressed year-earlier levels. 

   Net for the quarter ended Jan. 31 grew to $92.9 million, or 98 cents a share, from $78.3 million, or 82 cents a share, the year earlier. 

   The distiller said pre-tax operating profit rose 82% to $27.7 million from $15.2 million for the quarter. 
Sales increased 19% to $1.04 billion from $870.4 million. 
Profit from spirits and wine operations rose to $23.5 million from $104,000. 
A spokeswoman noted that year-earlier after-tax results were depressed by imposition of higher excise taxes. 

   The company's results also were largely affected by results of Du Pont Co., Wilmington, Del. 
Seagram owns a 22.5% stake in the large chemical and energy concern. 
Equity in unremitted earnings of Du Pont fell 29% to $29.3 million from $41.3 million, while dividend income rose slightly to $40.4 million from $37.9 million. 

   Seagram earlier this month agreed to sell several of its wine operations for about $200 million to Vintners International Co., a new concern formed by the unit's former president and other investors. 
The sale involved Seagram's moderately priced domestic brands. 
The company said it is retaining more expensive wine brands. 

   For the full year, net rose 33% to $423.5 million, or $4.45 a share, from $319.1 million, or $3.44 a share, mainly reflecting Du Pont's sharply improved earnings. 
Seagram's sales rose 13% to $3.34 billion from $2.97 billion. 

   Seagram's unremitted earnings from Du Pont for the year more than doubled to $169.1 million from $75.7 million a year ago. 
After-tax dividends rose to $154.1 million from $150.8 million. 

   Pre-tax operating profit for the year fell 10% to $192.8 million from $214.7 million. 
Profit from spirits and wine rose 3.6%, however, to $102.8 million from $99.2 million. 
Profit included nonrecurring charges of $35 million associated with the sale of several wine operations and a planned reorganization of spirits operations in the U.S. 
Much of the effect of the charges was offset by a related reduction of tax expense by $27.7 million.

<HL> Xerox, Finally Succumbing to Pressure,
Says It Will Sell South African Unit

<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp., one of the last die-hard supporters of an American corporate presence in South Africa, finally succumbed to pressures here and abroad and said it will sell its South African unit. 

   Xerox said its 51%-owned Rank Xerox unit, whose 49% partner is Rank Organisation PLC, a Britain-based leisure and hotel company, will sell the local business to Altron Group, a big South African electronics firm. 
Terms weren't disclosed for the sale, which is to be completed by May 1. 

   The pullout culminates more than a year of agonizing at Xerox, which in December held off a final decision as executives searched for a new approach that might let them stay in the racially troubled land. 
And the move is unlikely to ease the pressure from activists, who criticized Xerox's plans yesterday to let the unit continue selling photocopiers in South Africa after its sale. 

   "It's a perfect example of a decision that basically pleases no one," David T. Kearns, Xerox chairman, said in an interview. 

   Nor does it please him. 
Mr. Kearns was one of industry's most vocal proponents of the notion that only by staying can companies help end apartheid and repression in South Africa. 
His voice grew lonelier late last year when two other outspoken chairmen -- Roger B. Smith of General Motors Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.'s John F. Akers -- reversed course and pulled out. 

   Mr. Kearns said he still feels staying put is best for South Africa's 23 million blacks. 
But he now says leaving is what is best for Xerox. 
"It was clear things were continuing to deteriorate on all fronts," he said. 
The nation's economy and social climate were worsening; pro-disinvestment groups' criticism was rising; and Xerox was beginning to lose sales in the U.S. to local governments that were banning contracts with companies doing business there. 

   The departure by Xerox, the 14th-largest U.S. employer in South Africa, comes at a critical time for U.S. firms. 
The pace of pullouts is accelerating, as pressure groups that once praised any departure now say simply leaving isn't enough. 
The Reagan administration's patient approach toward the South African government has been all but dismissed, even by a Reagan-appointed advisory panel. 
And a May 31 deadline looms for U.S. companies that follow the Sullivan Principles, fairness tenets that for 10 years provided a moral ground for profiting from sales in South Africa. 

   The Rev. Leon H. Sullivan, founder of the principles, has said he will urge U.S. companies to leave South Africa if apartheid hasn't ended by May 31 -- a seemingly impossible prospect. 
That might lead to waves of new withdrawals. 

   Xerox, based in Stamford, Conn., became the 24th company to announce or complete a withdrawal in the first three months of this year. 
That compares with 49 corporations in all of 1986. 
The Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Center says 182 U.S. companies retain South African units and haven't announced shutdown plans; the total was 267 companies less than a year ago. 

   The financial impact on Xerox will be puny -- the unit provided less than 1% of Xerox's $9.78 billion of annual sales. 
Indeed, Xerox may have been more alarmed by the financial effects of staying. 
Last fall Xerox lost out on a photocopier contract with the Pittsburgh school board, which wouldn't buy from South Africa-linked companies. 

   The lost sales were "certainly a lot more than a few thousand dollars," Mr. Kearns said, "and it is something we saw increasing" unless Xerox pulled out. 
But he conceded he still may lose sales to such cities as Los Angeles, which has even tougher rules excluding companies that let their products be sold in South Africa even though they have shed direct investments there. 

   Most U.S. companies retain distribution agreements with the units they leave behind. 
Eastman Kodak Co. is one of the few that left and ended all product sales in South Africa. 
Richard Knight of the American Committee on Africa said cities will "see that Kodak is clean and Xerox isn't." 

   But Mr. Kearns countered that blocking all sales would leave workers without jobs and hurt the local units of customers Xerox supplies world-wide. 

   The criticism of Xerox comes despite the unusual efforts it made in pulling out. 
It negotiated a promise from the buyer that the unit's 800-plus employees won't lose their jobs. 
It also is forming a foundation run by black leaders that will spend $500,000 a year on social programs after Xerox leaves.

   ECONOMIC GROWTH starts to gather steam, forecasters say. 

   Chase Econometrics puts GNP first-quarter growth at about a 2.5% annual pace, up from the paltry 1.1% in 1986's fourth quarter; Wharton Econometric Forecasting is somewhat more bullish. 
Both say inventory building will help offset sluggish consumer outlays and weak capital spending. 
White House economist Sprinkel sticks to his 3.2% prediction for the year. 

   Some suggest that tax reform is causing short-term weakness in business investment, consumer spending and commercial construction. 
National Association of Manufacturers economist Jerry Jasinowski sees a "quite large" negative effect for the first half of the year. 
But public and private forecasters say that most of the problems are only temporary. 

   Officials say the chief question remains the impact of the dollar's decline. 
"Trade is our bottom line," says Commerce Undersecretary Robert Ortner. 

   BUSH STILL STUMBLES in the '88 race, while Hart dominates the Democrats. 

   A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows Bush's GOP support plummeting to 28% from 43% last August; Dole climbs to 23% from 10%. 
Bush's favorable ratings still exceed his negatives, but 54% of the public think that being Reagan's vice president has hurt his presidential prospects. 
His hopes of breaking out of his political doldrums were further damaged by a "60 Minutes" interview last weekend. 

   Democrat Hart, with 36%, has four times more support than his nearest competitor, Jesse Jackson; the poll shows Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis next with 5%. 
Among all voters, Hart beats both Bush and Dole and, by 41% to 36%, voters prefer a Democratic to a Republican president in 1988. 
But the Colorado Democrat's leftover debt from 1984 still plagues him. 

   WARMING TREND? 
The U.S. seeks a thaw with North Korea. 

   The recent decision to let U.S. diplomats talk to North Korean counterparts followed intelligence reports that Pyongyang wants to break out of its international isolation. 
The U.S. also feels pressure from China, which has improved its relations with Seoul and wants the U.S. to reciprocate. 

   Officials also hope to slow North Korea's recent moves toward the Soviets and reduce chances for an Olympic boycott. 
But South Korea balks at U.S. advice to respond more favorably to recent overtures. 
It fears that the north is only trying to foment domestic unrest through the peace noises. 

   "We've warned the U.S. that it won't get anywhere with North Korea," says a South Korean official. 

   BOTTOMING OUT? 
Federal regulators say their list of problem banks, which grew by one a day in 1986, appears to be growing at about half that rate this year. 
But major troubles remain in the oil states, and FDIC Chairman Seidman says that a record 200 or more banks could go under this year. 

   MEESE'S TACTICS on judgeships draw fire from Senate GOP moderates. 
They complain he is dragging his feet and trying to see that only highly conservative candidates are named. 
Pennsylvania's Heinz complains to chief of staff Baker, so far without results. 
Some members also suspect Meese of torpedoing ex-Sen. 
Gorton's chances. 

   OFF AND RUNNING: The Brookings Institution's Robert Reischauer is the early favorite to head the Congressional Budget Office. 
But the search is on hold while Congress wrestles with the budget; other candidates under consideration include congressional aides Van Ooms and Edward Gramlich, Brookings's Joseph Pechman and Henry Aaron, and the Urban Institute's Isabel Sawhill. 

   WELFARE OVERHAUL faces stiff political struggles, despite bipartisan agreement that changes are needed. 
Divisions remain on such major issues as whether some welfare payments should be raised. 
The administration expects easier agreement on proposals to set work requirements, which liberals may accept if support services such as child care are included. 

   DEMOCRATS JOSTLE over trade with an eye on the presidential race. 

   Hart resists calls for protectionism; he opposed textile restrictions in the Senate last year and has signaled his refusal to embrace quotas. 
But other presidential aspirants seek to woo labor with tough talk. 
Biden would threaten to let the dollar slide, or even link trade to the presence of U.S. troops in Japan and Germany. 

   Babbitt, who once used National Guard troops in a mining strike, now proposes stiff tariffs for nations that don't reduce their trade surpluses. 
Dukakis doesn't favor tariffs but says the U.S. may have to resort to "tough stuff" sometimes. 
Gephardt hopes for a public fight over his stringent amendment to the Ways and Means trade bill. 

   Some say Gephardt's posturing hampers the panel's work. 
"If he weren't running for president, it would be easier to deal with him," says Democratic Rep. Gibbons. 

   MINOR MEMOS: Bad news, worse news: New Hampshire GOP Sen. Rudman says polls in his state show that presidential hopeful Alexander Haig "is unknown, but he has strong negatives." . . . 
Associate Attorney General Stephen Trott will perform with his old singing group, the Highwaymen, at a reunion concert. 
The group had a gold record in 1961, for "Michael, Row the Boat Ashore." . . . 
Asked how to pay for extra spending proposals, Speaker Wright suggests a request to the Sultan of Brunei.

Where the Bosses Are:
Settling in Greenwich, Conn., May Not
Make You a CEO -- But It Couldn't Hurt
---
By Roger Ricklefs</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Migrating Canada geese have always flown over the New York suburb of Greenwich, Conn. 
About a dozen years ago, many decided to become full-time residents. 

   Greenwich has water, meadows and bird-lovers who are generous with their gourmet bread crumbs. 
But plagued by goose droppings on its beach, the town finally brought out its biggest gun: a yacht-club cannon. 
The booms from blanks failed to budge the birds from some of America's choicest real estate. 

   "We have passed a law against feeding the birds now, but who's going to arrest someone for feeding a goose?" says Greenwich's equivalent of a mayor, First Selectman John B. Margenot Jr. 

   As America's corporate elite sees it, the birds know a good thing. 
Of all the suburbs where top executives have flocked since World War II, none has attracted so many as this town of 60,000, a 51-minute train ride from midtown Manhattan. 

   "In terms of the number of chief executive officers of major companies who live there, no other place comes close," says Thomas J. Neff, president of the executive recruiters Spencer Stuart &amp; Associates and himself a Greenwich resident. 
The town today can claim -- besides such celebrities as David Stockman and Diana Ross -- current or recent chief executives of Exxon Corp., Citicorp, General Electric Co., American Express Co., PepsiCo Inc., GTE Corp., Union Pacific Corp., Combustion Engineering Inc. and others. 

   Greenwich is no idyllic retreat, no haven from sprawl, congestion, unhappiness, crime or drugs. 
Neither is it Middletown, U.S.A. 
In large parts of Greenwich, the minimum lot size is four acres. 
The median price of single-family houses sold there last year was $480,000. 

   The local high school -- whose principal is called a headmaster -- has been ranked among the nation's best. 
It periodically sends its girls' lacrosse team to play in England. 
Yet 36% of Greenwich's high school seniors say they get drunk or high on alcohol once a week a more. 

   On the surface, big white neo-Colonial houses on vast lawns make this town look as if it might never change. 
But Greenwich, like other executive towns, is changing. 

   For one thing, the affluent have become more so. 
Membership in a single country club was once a luxury. 
Now, many residents belong to two or even three. 

   "The yacht club near us is only open in summer, so we belong to another one for winter entertainment," says the wife of a recently retired New York mining executive. 
In Vermont, where they summer, the couple belong to yet another club. 

   Life in the clubs is changing, too. 
Reflecting today's exercise craze, strenuous sports such as tennis and squash are gaining ground fast, says John Moreland, general manager of the Greenwich Country Club. 
Interest in gourmet dining is rising. 
When the club recently scheduled a $200-a-couple dinner, it had to draw up a waiting list. 
"Ten years ago, this wouldn't have gone over," Mr. Moreland says. 

   Greenwich homeowners have plenty of assets, on paper at least, to cover their bills for pheasant terrine. 
Soaring real estate values have seen to that. 
Last year, one in seven houses sold there fetched more than $1 million, and one went for more than $11 million. 
A service station owner says he recently sold his house there for $500,000 to build a better one. 

   Simple clapboard houses on ordinary city lots can still be found -- at $250,000. 
More Greenwichers than in the past have bought one or more "second homes" in New England, Florida, the Caribbean or New York City. 
"The person who used to have two houses now has four," says Carl W. Menk, chairman of Canny, Bowen Inc., executive recruiters in New York. 

   The standard of living for children seems to have risen even more. 
Instead of parking the kids with Grandma, parents take them to Europe; Mr. Neff's two sons are traveling with him to the Bahamas this spring and to England this summer. 

   About half the students at Greenwich High own or have access to a home computer, says David Quattrone, headmaster. 

   Girls' lacrosse isn't the only vehicle for foreign adventure. 
The school's idea of a Western Civilization class trip is a yearly pilgrimage to France, Italy or Greece, and about a third of the class goes. 
Of 700 seniors, 500 have parking permits, according to Mr. Quattrone. 
But, he adds, "only a few" have Mercedes-Benzes or BMWs. 

   "Kids here can grow up with an unbalanced view of what the world is like," says Stephen Brecher, partner in the accounting firm of Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co. in New York. 
But like many parents there, he says the quality of the school system was a "key reason" he moved to Greenwich. 

   In fact, executive suburbs such as Greenwich seem to be holding their coveted position in U.S. education. 
A few years ago, a survey of college admissions officers and high school principals ranked the high school there in the nation's top 12. 

   About a quarter of the students qualify for advanced college placement in at least one subject. 
Around 200 of the high school students a year take calculus, commonly a college-level course, Mr. Quattrone says. 
Teachers earn as much as $45,000 a year, and their classes average only 20 students each. 

   But about a quarter of the town's students attend private schools. 
At the Brunswick School, a boys' day school, mandatory Latin starts in the seventh grade. 
Many students take calculus there, too. 

   Students are concerned with doing well. 
But many suffer from "fear that they won't be able to match their parents' achievements," says Norman A. Pedersen, headmaster of Brunswick. 

   "The parents don't have to say a word," he says. 
"It's in the culture." 
The pressure to perform contributes to teenage drinking and drug-taking, some Greenwichers say. 
Others point to busy parents' frequent absences for business or pleasure. 

   "The party scene revolves around houses where parents are absent for the weekend," Mr. Quattrone says. 

   Whatever the causes, the problems worry Greenwich. 
In a poll of 4,355 youngsters three years ago, 15% of the high school seniors -- and 4% of the seventh graders -- said they used marijuana at least once a week. 
Moreover, 57% of seniors and 12% of eighth-graders said they drank at least once a week. 
Five percent of the town's eighth-graders said they were getting drunk or high on liquor at least once a week. 

   One parent recalls a high school student so drunk he passed out in class -- at 10 a.m. 
In a thriving volunteer program called Safe Rides, teen-agers give rides to other youngsters too drunk to drive. 

   "You just can't overestimate the problem," says the Rev. John W. Bishop, rector of Christ Episcopal Church. 
But the youngsters aren't alone in their problem. 
An Alcoholics Anonymous group that meets at the church Friday evenings is so packed "you can't find a parking place," Father Bishop says. 

   In at least one important way, the pressure on adults is easing significantly in towns such as Greenwich. 
As more companies move to the suburbs, hundreds of executives are putting the train ride to the city behind them. 

   "Ten years ago, the bulk of people who commuted went to New York," says Mr. Moreland, the country club manager. 
"Now, more than half commute to towns in the area." 

   Life also is changing in other ways. 
Even among women in their 50s who are married to senior executives, about a quarter now hold jobs, Father Bishop estimates. 
And of Greenwich women in their 30s and 40s married to executives, probably 60% to 70% have jobs, he says. 

   "After people ask you what you are up to 750 times, you think, 'Now I have to be up to something,'" says Cecie Munkenbeck, wife of a corporate executive who started a landscape design career in her late 50s. 

   The environmental movement is thriving. 
If there is one thing that America's premier corporate bedroom doesn't want, it seems to be more business. 
In recent years, several companies, such as Chesebrough-Pond's Inc., have moved their headquarters to Greenwich or nearby towns. 
To try to hold down congestion, Greenwich imposed two moratoriums on office building in the past decade; and after each one was lifted, restrictions were tightened. 

   "My biggest source of complaints is expansion of office buildings," Mr. Margenot, the first selectman, says. 
Now, Greenwich is fighting the proposed expansion of a corporate headquarters just across the city line in Stamford. 
Workers driving to the office crowd a Greenwich street, residents say. 
Some even propose making the street one-way: away from the office in the morning, toward it in the afternoon. 

   In the long run, another change now taking place may become the most significant one: The people of Greenwich are becoming more diverse. 

   As in some other suburbs favored by corporate elites, many residents years ago resisted selling their homes to Jews. 
Even today, many country clubs have few Jewish members. 

   But Greenwich's Jewish population has grown to between 4,000 and 5,000 -- triple the figure of 20 years ago, says Rabbi Hillel Silverman, leader of a Jewish congregation there. 
He says Jews no longer encounter problems buying homes in Greenwich. 

   At Greenwich High School, minority-group enrollment, about equally divided among black, Hispanic and Asian students, has climbed to 10% of the student body from 6.5% in 1980, Mr. Quattrone says. 
The minorities' representation in the total town population is smaller but still significant. 

   Many descendants of black servants live in modest Greenwich frame houses, and a few more middle-class blacks are moving in. 
But as real estate prices rise, black and white residents are coming to share a fear that their children won't live as adults in the kind of town they knew as children. 

   Nancy C. Brown, a black town official whose husband's family has lived there for three generations, says her son "would love to live in Greenwich." 
The son, a computer graphics artist, has bought a house in nearby -- but less expensive -- Stamford. 

   "There's no question about it," she says, "people have a real fear of being squeezed out."

Genex Recruits Frashier to Polish Image;
New Chief Sets Plans for the Long Haul

<TEXT>
   Genex Corp. said it recruited Gary E. Frashier as president and chief executive officer in an effort to "improve the image" of the struggling biotechnology concern. 

   Mr. Frashier, 50 years old, has been chairman and chief executive officer of Continental Water Systems Corp., a San Antonio, Texas-based unit of Olin Corp., which produces ultra-pure water for scientific use. 
He succeeds J. Leslie Glick, 46, who resigned in January at the behest of Genex's chairman and largest stockholder, Robert F. Johnson. 

   Genex hopes Mr. Frashier can restructure the company by shedding some lackluster operations and pushing for new products. 
"He has the kind of commercial savvy we need," said a company official. 
"He understands the industrial markets we serve." 

   Under Mr. Glick, Genex had pinned most of its hopes on Proto, an enzyme-based drain cleaner that isn't corrosive. 
That Proto strategy had been to build a broad customer base among hospitals, colleges, restaurants and various other institutions. 

   But Mr. Frashier considers that approach too fragmented to be effective. 
"I don't think cleaning products are the future for Genex," he said. 
Genex has held talks with several companies about selling the Proto license, Mr. Frashier said, but he declined to identify any prospective buyers. 

   Genex has been floundering since 1985, when it lost a big contract to supply raw materials for aspartame, an artificial sweetener made by Monsanto Co.'s G.D. Searle &amp; Co. unit. 
Sales to Searle had accounted for 58% of Genex's annual revenue. 
The loss of the contract forced Genex to dismiss 40% of its work force and post a $15.9 million loss that year. 
For the first nine months of 1986, Genex reported a loss of $2.4 million. 
Earlier this month, the company arranged a $4 million line of credit with four venture-capital groups. 

   Mr. Frashier is betting that Genex's new "affinity" proteins still under development will have greater commercial success. 
These proteins bind tightly to specific molecules, offering the prospect of such applications as the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and the separation and purification of materials. 
In addition, Mr. Frashier will push for development of a line of protein-based adhesive and coating products. 

   "I think our chances of commercial success are greater in these areas (than in cleaning products), though we have to do it carefully and thoroughly," Mr. Frashier said. 

   A chemical engineer by training, Mr. Frashier is a former executive of Loctite Corp., an adhesives maker, and once headed three divisions of Millipore Corp., a maker of purification and separation products. 
In 1984, he organized a management buyout of one of those divisions, Continental Water Systems, which Olin acquired recently. 

   Mr. Frashier, who also was named a director at Genex, doesn't expect any quick fixes at the company. 
"I wouldn't call myself a turnaround specialist," he said. 
"I plan to be here for the long haul."

Running the Show Italian Style:
With Raul Gardini at the Helm, Ferruzzi Group
Has Taken on the Personality of Its Top Hand
---
By Philip Revzin</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Most top executives have a little weekend place where they can escape the pressures of the office. 
Raul Gardini's retreat is a dozen-room "palazzo" built in 1487 on Venice's Grand Canal, just a gondola's ride from St. Mark's Square. 

   Nouveau this is not. 
The silver-haired, lightly tanned Mr. Gardini, chairman of Italy's Ferruzzi Group, entertains a visitor at Ca'Dario in a room that glows in a riot of 17th-century and 18th-century furniture, a 19th-century copy of a 15th-century ceramic stove and a Murano glass chandelier. 
Pouring 10-year-old brandy from a crystal decanter, Mr. Gardini shares his thoughts on his work style. 

   "I work as long as I need to, but not for the sake of working," he says. 

   Ferruzzi, with interests in sugar, chemical and agricultural businesses, is Italy's third largest private company and an increasing power in European industry. 
It is an enterprise with $8 billion a year in sales and 15,000 employees. 
It also is one that the 52-year-old Mr. Gardini manages to escape from -- Venice is some 80 miles from his office and principal home in Ravennan -- early every weekend. 
There's a telephone in the wood-paneled elevator that serves Ca'Dario's wood-paneled dining room, but Mr. Gardini gives the distinct impression that any calls had better be important. 
"I trust my managers," he says. 
"I leave them to do their jobs. 
Management is people, and what counts is results." 

   Executives everywhere value results. 
But European executives such as Mr. Gardini, more than their American counterparts, also value a style that enables them to imbue their enterprises with their personalities, to revel in their culture and history, to take their weekends and four or five weeks of vacation a year and still get the job done. 

   "The American executive is probably harder working than the Italian or French one," says Egon Zehnder, an international management consultant based in Zurich. 
"It's rare to see a top American executive take more than two weeks vacation straight. 
But you can't reach anybody in August in France or Italy." 

   To Mr. Zehnder the main difference between American and Italian executives lies in their imagination and intuition. 
"The American is a well-structured individual, knows the rules, his limitations and his job description, and acts accordingly," Mr. Zehnder says. 
"The Italian probably doesn't have a job description, and if he does he doesn't pay any attention to it." 

   Although individual executives often defy national stereotypes, experience shows that a certain reality underlies them. 
The stereotypes class German executives as strict followers of the rules, formal and correct to the point of coolness with employees and clients. 
Swiss executives also adhere to the rules but smile occasionally. 
The French honor some rules, smile and make sure the wine is properly served at lunch. 

   But the Italians, ah . . . . 


   In Italy, says Mr. Zehnder, "The emotion is all part of the show. 
The boss can blow his top and the relationship doesn't suffer. 
In terms of a relaxed, informal atmosphere in the office it's probably closest to the U.S., except that nobody in Italy uses first names." 

   These days in Italy the stereotype is bending a little, and Mr. Gardini prides himself on being part of the vanguard of a new breed of professional manager, not at all a part of the "establishment," the few old families that still run much of Italian industry. 

   Born into a Ravenna farming family, Mr. Gardini studied agricultural science in school and joined Ferruzzi in 1955. 
Two years later, he married the daughter of the firm's founder, Serafino Ferruzzi. 
At the time, the agricultural firm's affairs were cloaked in a tradition of secrecy and reticence. 
Its recent purchase of a 25% interest in Montedison, the publicly traded chemical giant, has changed that. 
Ferruzzi has muscled its way into the industrial establishment, and the mystery that surrounded the firm has begun to dissolve. 

   The company finally created a public relations department, for example. 
Several affiliates are now publicly traded and must disclose their finances. 
Mr. Gardini, thrust into public view, often is being referred to as Italy's third industrial titan, joining Fiat's Gianni Agnelli and Olivetti's Carlo De Benedetti. 
While their wealth still may exceed his, Mr. Gardini certainly has become one of the tiny fraction of Italians whose income would make them multimillionaires anywhere. 

   The senior titans, Messrs. 
Agnelli and De Benedetti, spend a lot of their off-hours at seminars and colloquiums, expounding on their management philosophy and world view. 
Mr. Gardini shuns such affairs, preferring to curl up with a good book at Ca'Dario. 
His reading centers on agriculture and sports, but he also tackles Faulkner, Dos Passos and Hemingway, in translation. 
He is a fervent duck hunter. 

   Unlike most other top executives in Italy, Mr. Gardini doesn't speak English, though he is fluent in French. 
He also has managed to avoid being pigeonholed and nicknamed by the media. 
Mr. Agnelli is "the Lawyer." 
Mr. De Benedetti is "the Engineer." 
Mr. Gardini has been called "the Farmer" and "the Pharaoh," the latter for reasons that have vaguely to do with his financial ability, but neither epithet has stuck. 

   Mr. Gardini smiles broadly over that. 
"I'm delighted that I can't be categorized," he says. 
"I'm different." 

   He is different, too, in his approach to running the show. 
Mr. Agnelli, Fiat's patriarch, leaves no doubt as to who is in charge of all aspects of the business. 
A show of control is less important to Mr. Gardini. 
While he seems totally self-assured, he can also be reticent. 
He is more charming than charismatic. 

   "People here always are saying that I'm the new boss of this company or that company that we acquire," Mr. Gardini says, tapping his eighth Winston of the evening into a crystal ashtray, his right eyelid drooping almost shut. 
"I'm not the boss at all. 
The managers are the bosses. 
They report to me, sure, but the day-to-day concerns are theirs, not mine." 

   The executive says he generally keeps his dealings confined to a core group of 10 or so executives at the Ravenna headquarters, which is located in Serafino Ferruzzi's old home. 
He prefers to visit his executives in their offices, not summon them to his, and when he visits Ferruzzi facilities he has no special office set aside for himself. 
"Just give me a chair and I can get done what I need to," he says. 

   Mr. Gardini has dealt with American executives. 
He seems to differ most from them in his longer-term thinking, which envisions the distant past as well as the distant future. 
He shudders at the image of a U.S. executive at a chrome-topped desk in a steel and glass skyscraper "with the computer screen flashing three-month projections." 
He says: "It's all too short-term in the U.S. Nothing connects." 

   During weekends at Ca'Dario -- and some weekday mornings before work, when he arises at 6 a.m. to stroll to the office at 8 -- Mr. Gardini enjoys the luxury of simply thinking. 

   Europe's business future lies in pan-European companies, Mr. Gardini believes, and he is trying to make Ferruzzi one of them. 
It already owns Beghin-Say, the French sugar maker. (Ferruzzi was recently blocked in its bid for control of S&amp;W Berisford Ltd., parent of British Sugar Corp., which would have made the Italian company the world's biggest sugar producer, with 25% of the European market.) 

   Pan-European companies such as that, Mr. Gardini believes, will be big enough competitors to play in the same league with American and Japanese industrial giants. 
He also thinks about taking Ferruzzi public. 
Sooner or later, he says, it must become publicly held. 

   As Mr. Gardini talks, the weekend draws to a close. 
He hops into Ca'Dario's motor launch for the 30-minute ride to Venice's airport, where Ferruzzi's nine-seater jet takes him to Paris for a business meeting. 
"We've got to think wider and broader, not just Italian," he says during the flight. 
"That goes for cultural and philosophical interests, not just business." 

   For instance, Mr. Gardini says, he is worried increasingly by pollution in Europe and the need to find new solutions, rather than, as in the past, export waste down rivers or out smokestacks to drift across borders. 
Ferruzzi has invested heavily in ethanol plants, including one that just opened in Louisiana, which turn surplus grains and sugar into a gasoline additive that replaces lead. 
If ethanol catches on, it would be profitable as well as ecologically sound. 

   Beyond ethanol, Mr. Gardini also expounds thoughtfully and passionately on the need to solve North-South tensions while continuing to improve agricultural productivity. 
He worries about South America, which he calls "a real disaster," and about agricultural trade tensions between the U.S. and Europe, which he calls "a real war." 

   These problems must be solved "by heads" -- he taps his -- "not fists." 
He talks of the "new agriculture," a variation of the "Green Revolution," involving different crops for different needs. 
Ferruzzi, for its part, single-handedly launched soybean production in Italy and is trying to start a cotton-growing industry there. 
"These," he says, "are the sorts of things that mean something."

   Bombay Palace Restaurants Inc. and Lifestyle Restaurants Inc. amended their merger agreement, reducing to about $7.5 million from $9 million the amount that Bombay Palace will pay for Lifestyle. 

   Under the amended accord, Bombay Palace will offer one share of its common stock for every six Lifestyle shares outstanding. 
The initial pact, signed Feb. 19, called for a 1-for-5 ratio. 

   Bombay Palace, which owns and operates Indian restaurants, said it reduced the offer after closer examination of past performance and prospects for Lifestyle, which operates Beefsteak Charlie's restaurants. 
Both companies are based here. 
Lifestyle officials couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Also, Lifestyle will pay $575 plus accrued interest for each of its 13% convertible subordinated debentures instead of the $550 plus accrued interest it had initially offered. 
The offer ends April 14. 

   The transaction remains subject to several conditions, including approval of Lifestyle's holders, a favorable opinion from Lifestyle's investment banker, and certain regulatory consents. 

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Bombay Palace closed at $7.875, down 12.5 cents. 
In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Lifestyle closed at 93.75 cents, down 18.75 cents.

Outplace Those Terminators:
Simply Saying 'You're Fired' Isn't Easy
But It's the Mark of a Classy Dismissal
---
By Robert Johnson</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   "You know, Phil, there are times in a man's career when . . . 
I mean, it's always important to consider your options, and I think it's more and more important in your career now. 
You know, Phil, there are a lot of reasons for it, and I guess I'm not saying this very well, and as a matter of fact, I'm operating on orders from on high -- but I think you should accelerate the process of keeping your options open. 
Decisions are being made, if you know what I mean. 

   "Listen, Phil, if you want to continue this, let's go have a drink. 
But I'll tell you now, you've been loyal to us for 15 years, that's real loyalty, and I know this is tough. 
But as strange as it may seem, Phil, just remember this is the first day of the rest of your life. 
Really, that's all I have to say, except that while this is an ending, it's not like an ending-ending, you know. 
You'll get your checks for a while, at least. 
Look, this is Friday. 
On Monday, I'll see Personnel and find out just how long you'll get 'em." 

   By now, Phil may have caught the drift. 
He's being fired by his well-intentioned superior -- in a mock firing staged by Steven G. Harrison, a New York outplacement consultant. 

   It's a sloppy firing that a beginning firer can easily manage. 
But the supreme test of executive skill is firing with grace. 
It happens to be the most dreaded test of executive skill, too. 

   It's so shunned that although most managers going up the ladder are occasionally required to fire, once having ascended to the top they delegate the job. 
Andrew Sherwood, a New York management consultant, says that only about 5% of chief executives do their own firing. 
"These are people who are compulsive builders," he says. 
"They like acquiring companies, making profits go up, and recruiting people. 
Firing isn't what they're emotionally geared for. 
They find it repugnant." 

   Peter Lewis, chairman and chief executive officer of Progressive Insurance Co. in Cleveland, says that firing his president of 13 years in 1983 "was tougher than divorcing my wife." 

   "Fire" is a four-letter word, and the implications aren't lost on most executives. 
"We ought to get that word out of the lexicon," says A. Robert Abboud, former chairman of First Chicago Corp. 
"It's a crudity." 
The word crept into common usage about 100 years ago as a pun on "discharge." 
By now, "discharge" has become a euphemism, along with newer ones like "terminate," "dismiss," and "let go." 
Sooner or later, no doubt, unwanted employees will simply be "outplaced." 

   Humor is said to succeed by exposing frightening or indelicate realities of the human condition in the form of hyperbole, or slapstick. 
Cartoonist Chic Young and his son and successor, Dean Young, made the firing scenes in their comic strip, "Blondie," a part of American folklore. 
Firing is a way of life at Dithers &amp; Co., where Julius C. Dithers, founder of the construction concern, has axed Dagwood Bumstead hundreds of times over the years. 

   Mr. Dithers's style is to creep up on Dagwood, who is often either tardy or asleep at work, and yell in his ear. 
Then he follows up with a swift kick in the pants, or he literally tosses Dagwood out of the office. 

   It hardly needs saying that no one in American business fires quite like Mr. Dithers. 
But, says Dean Young, "A lot of people tell me he's the quintessential boss." 

   The reason is simple: If "fire" is, as Mr. Abboud says, a "crudity," firing is a hostile act; Mr. Dithers shows just how hostile. 
Firing threatens an employee and his family with the loss of their livelihood. 
It illuminates a grim fact that the employee is viewed as an economic factor, and a not very productive one at that. 
Never is it a joy. 

   Firing with grace -- with style -- takes all that into account but minimizes the consequences that lie within the power of the employer to manage. 
Simple kindness may move employers to master the art of firing. 
But there are other motives. 
The way an employee is fired affects the motivation and morale of remaining employees, as well as potential employees. 
It may damage the company's reputation with customers who deal with the fired employee. 
It may result in expensive litigation. 
It may also affect the company's reputation among shareholders and others. 

   Mr. Abboud says that tactful firing requires "a sense of artistry and maybe a little guile." 
At First Chicago, he says, "I was sometimes guilty of not gilding the lily, of coming right to the heart of the matter." 
Yet his directness earned him a reputation for abrasiveness. 
He himself was forced to resign as First Chicago's chairman at a board meeting in 1980. 

   To avoid brutality, some executives, like Phil's superior, become too oblique when firing. 
"I wrote a note (firing) one of my headquarters workers whose job had been eliminated by a new computer. 
But she didn't catch on in the slightest," says C. Robertson Trowbridge, president of Yankee Publishing Inc., in Dublin, N.H. 
"Two weeks later she was still there." 

   Mr. Trowbridge violated one rule of firing by doing it in writing rather than in person. 
But he observes two other rules to make firing easier. 
For one, he doesn't hire friends or relatives of friends. 
He once had to fire the wife of a man who played in a band with him on weekends. 
"You don't want to alienate your clarinet player," he says. 
Second, he doesn't fire on Friday. 
"I don't want to wonder all weekend how he's taking it at his home," he says. 
"It's better to do it on Monday, and give him the whole week to chase down his pals and pick up on some new leads." 

   Others say Tuesday is better. 
If a firing is scheduled for Monday, the boss is still likely to spend all weekend fretting over the prospect -- and the boss's morale is important, too. 

   Half an hour before lunchtime is probably the most propitious time, says Mr. Harrison, who is president of Lee Hecht Harrison Inc. in New York. 
That's because the employee will probably want to leave the office for a while afterward. 

   Mr. Harrison's firm has prepared a brochure called "Termination Guidelines: How to Avoid the Pitfalls." 
It stresses planning. 
Before firing, for example, the employer should write a letter explaining the employee's separation benefits; the shock of being fired is likely to obliterate or garble the explanation he gets during his firing. 
The employer should give the employee the letter immediately after the firing. 

   For most executives, the hardest thing is what to say. 
Mr. Harrison suggests that Phil's boss should have said something like this: 

   "Phil, we have reached a decision, although it is not the happiest. 
Effective now, you are no longer employed here. 

   "Some of the reasons you already know. 
But the important thing now is what comes next. 
We'll give you help in getting employment. 
Just because it didn't work out here doesn't mean it won't work out elsewhere. 
I'm giving you a paper explaining your benefits, including salary continuation and outplacement counseling. 
You will have about four months' salary, including vacation time, and your medical benefits will continue while you're on salary." 

   Some executives would rather begin by reciting the employee's virtues and recalling his contributions to the company. 
But one executive who tried that says the "firee" interrupted him to ask for a raise. 
"You must first tell the person outright that this talk isn't to discuss whether he's leaving but the circumstances of his departure," says Charles C. Jett, a Chicago executive recruiter. 

   Above all, Mr. Harrison says, the person doing the firing should avoid buckpassing ("I'm operating on orders from on high") and platitudes ("This is the first day of the rest of your life.") 

   Still, says Daniel T. Carroll, former president and chief executive officer of Hoover Universal Inc., in Ann Arbor, Mich., it's never easy. 
"You can teach what happens in a firing episode," he says. 
"But each one is so different that the advice may be misleading." 

   Mr. Carroll himself was fired from Hoover, now a subsidiary of Johnson Controls Inc., Milwaukee, in 1982. 
"It was very brief," he says. 
"The directors didn't want to go in the direction I wanted. 
They asked for my resignation." 
Today he is his own boss as an independent consultant in Ann Arbor. 
"There's no one here to fire me," he says.

   Amcast Industrial Corp. said it sold its Newnam division to a new company formed by employees. 
The purchase price wasn't disclosed. 

   The sale consists of an Amcast plant in Kendallville, Ind., with about 300 employees. 
Amcast, a maker of metal cast products, said the sale is a result of its decision to exit the gray iron castings business. 
The plant makes castings for the auto and commercial air conditioning and refrigeration industries. 

   L.W. Ladehoff, Amcast chairman and chief executive officer, said the division was marginally profitable. 
It represented about 8% of Amcast's $229 million in sales in its fiscal year ended Aug. 31.

Five Future No. 1s:
It's a Good Bet That One of These Women
Will Lead a Fortune 500 Firm in the 1990s

   Only one woman heads a Fortune 500 company today. 
And Katharine Graham of the Washington Post Co. inherited the job, which both her father and her husband held. 

   Soon, however, Fortune 500 directors may be turning more and more to women when they tap new chief executive officers. 
"It's inevitable," says Rand Corp. economist James P. Smith. 
"Large numbers of women are in the middle-management pipeline now, and in 10 years you'll see far more than one in the CEO ranks." 

   Executive women on the rise are choosing untraditional routes to the top. 
Instead of climbing a single corporate ladder rung by rung, some women are zigzagging their way higher, moving from company to company, industry to industry or from the private sector to public service and back again. 
Others are departing from the usual big business management routes to nurture -- or acquire -- companies of their own. 
And some women develop so much expertise in new, technology-linked fields that they can't be overlooked. 

   Here are five of the women who, experts say, stand a better-than-even chance of becoming Fortune 500 chief executives by 1997: 

   DEBORAH COLEMAN
   Vice President, Operations, Apple Computer Inc. 

   Her dream was to run a factory and combine "the best manufacturing technology with the best people-management." 
When she joined Apple Computer Inc. in 1981 as controller of the Macintosh division, she struck a pact with company founder Steven Jobs to let her run the new Macintosh plant if she built the best finance team in the industry. 

   Today, 34-year-old Deborah A. Coleman is known throughout Silicon Valley as a high-technology manufacturing wizard. 
At Apple's Fremont, Calif., Macintosh plant, where several of her predecessors had been fired, she ended production havoc in six months -- eliminating computer-driven equipment that wasn't "people friendly," slashing inventory and boosting productivity. 

   "A lot of what I did was common sense," says Ms. Coleman, who routinely pulled everyone in the plant together to set monthly goals and, as she puts it, "foster a shared vision." 
As a result, assembly line workers agreed to work 12-hour shifts at times to meet certain production schedules, and the labor rate was reduced to less than 30 minutes for each Macintosh. 

   Promoted to vice president of manufacturing in 1985, Ms. Coleman promptly reduced Apple's inventory 37%, introduced new delivery schedules and cut the number of vendors the company uses more than one-third, to less than 300. 

   Currently in charge of Apple's plants in Ireland, Singapore and California, the single Ms. Coleman, who holds an M.B.A. from Stanford University, hopes to "work myself out of this job within two years." 
She predicts that as Apple grows, the company will be reorganized into separate business units, "and I wouldn't mind running one of those major businesses." 

   KAREN HORN
   Chairman and CEO-Elect, Banc One -- Cleveland Unit. 

   She has moved from the private sector to public service and back again, jumping several management rungs each time. 
The leap Karen Horn will make next month from president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland to chairman and chief executive officer of Banc One Corp.'s Cleveland unit, with $1.4 billion in assets, will make her the highest-ranking woman in U.S. banking. 

   The 43-year-old Mrs. Horn is known as a consummate strategist and crisis manager. 
At the Fed she helped resolve Ohio's thrift crisis in 1985, when the failure of Home State Savings Bank triggered a panic and prompted the closing of dozens of privately insured thrifts. 
She quickly scattered regulators across the state to identify troubled thrifts. 
Recognizing that Ohio's insurance pool wouldn't even cover Home State's losses, she also instituted a plan to monitor deposit withdrawals at the other institutions insured by the fund to forestall other failures. 

   But it is her ability to lead others that should help Mrs. Horn strengthen Banc One and that makes her an attractive potential candidate to head a non-banking concern. 
"She has a presence that drives the best in people," says Linda Page, Ohio's banking commissioner. 
"She'll look at you in a very engaging way and say, 'Tell me about that.' 
You can see her mind churning with thoughts, but she always makes you feel that you're helping resolve the problem." 

   Mrs. Horn says she devotes as much time as possible to her husband of 21 years and their 4-year-old son. 
But she rejects the label "superwoman." 
"I haven't met one yet," she says. 
"I do a lot of things at home and in business, but I have a lot of people helping me." 

   Kay Koplovitz
   President and CEO, USA Network 

   She started her career as a television producer in Milwaukee and soon concluded that "the best way to get to the top for a woman is to start at the top with a business of her own. 
If I'd stayed in Milwaukee, I never would have made it to station manager." 

   Kay Koplovitz founded USA Network in 1980 and shaped it to become the No. 1 cable network in terms of viewership and the first to use on-air advertisers. 
Today the network provides around-the-clock programming to 33 million households through 8,500 systems. 
And with revenue last year of about $80 million, USA Network -- jointly owned by Time Inc., Gulf &amp; Western Inc.'s Paramount Pictures Corp. unit and MCA Inc. -- is continuing to grow 20% to 30% annually. 

   What has set USA Network apart is its diverse programming. 
Ms. Koplovitz, who is 41, was the first to negotiate national cable rights to major-league sports. 
She also launched an award-winning children's program series as well as adult dramas and movies. 

   "Instead of simply carving out one little niche like a lot of cable companies, she's taken on a mix of distinguished programming," says Mel Harris, president of Paramount's television group and a member of USA Network's executive committee. 
"She could handle a Fortune 500 board." 

   Married to attorney William Koplovitz Jr., she says, "I wanted to be president of CBS when I started in television. 
But my job now may be more challenging. 
We're the upstarts trying to chip into the broadcast guys' territory." 

   COLOMBE NICHOLAS
   President, Christian Dior America
   She familiarized the U.S. with the French name Dior and changed Dior's image from matronly to youthful. 
Her strategy boasted an advertising campaign that featured the escapades of a raffish menage a trois. 

   While company licensees at first were nervous that the ads were too risque, the campaign hooked consumers. 
Under Colombe Nicholas's direction, revenue at Christian Dior America has more than doubled in the past six years, to $315 million in 1986. 
The number of licensees making Dior products has jumped 45%. 

   Before taking over Dior's American arm, the 41-year-old Ms. Nicholas spent 10 years in New York retailing -- at Macy's and Bloomingdale's and at Bonwit Teller, where she was vice president of merchandising. 
But she believes her international background -- and fluency in French -- gave her the edge over several contenders for the Dior job. 

   The eldest daughter of an Ohio-businessman father and a French mother, Ms. Nicholas spent part of her childhood in Switzerland. 
At her father's insistence, she also acquired a law degree. 
"I hated law school, but now I thank my father every day," she says. 
"I learned how to think analytically." 

   Married to art collector Leonard Rosenberg, Ms. Nicholas describes herself as "very goal-focused" and "a risk taker," but isn't a workaholic, she says. 
She rarely gets to her office before 9:30 a.m. and says, "When I meet someone who tells me they've been up since 5, jogged 10 miles and gotten five kids off to school, I ask, 'Where's the coffee?'" 

   Since it isn't likely that Christian Dior America will be spun off or go public, Ms. Nicholas would have to move to another company to become a Fortune 500 CEO. 
A multinational marketing concern would be her most likely move, executive recruiters say. 
She doesn't rule out that possibility, but says she also is considering a switch to politics. 
"We need more women in government," she says, "and a business background there could be very relevant." 

   LINDA WACHNER
   President, Warnaco Inc.
   She calls herself "the first woman to succeed at the takeover game," a strategy that she figures was her swiftest route to the top. 

   Determined to head a large company, Linda Wachner last year spearheaded a leveraged buyout of Warnaco Inc., the Bridgeport, Conn.-based apparel manufacturer of Hathaway shirts, Pringle sweaters and a score of other well-known brands. 
Her goal is to make Warnaco "the foremost apparel conglomerate in the world" by doubling last year's sales of $575 million in five years. 
By then, the 41-year-old executive predicts, the company, which is Fortune 500 in size, could go public. 

   Ms. Wachner's marketing and turnaround expertise should serve her well. 
As vice president of Warnaco's Warner bras unit 12 years ago, she revolutionized that business by developing wireless bras and displaying them not in the customary boxes but simply on hangers. 
Later, as president of Beatrice Cos.' 
Max Factor cosmetics business, she nursed the faltering unit back to health, launching Le Jardin, Factor's first successful new perfume in years. 

   At Warnaco, where she puts in 14-hour days, Ms. Wachner has installed new managers and designers, and cut overhead by consolidating divisions. 
She shops in at least one department store each day "to see what the competition is selling," often dragging Warnaco executives with her. 

   When she isn't visiting Warnaco plants or Paris fashion shows, Ms. Wachner, a widow, shuttles between apartments in Los Angeles and New York. 
She doesn't mind being called "tough" and "driven" by some subordinates, she says, "as long as that means driven for a reason. 

   "To make it to the top," she says, "you've got to want it with all your heart."

<HL> AmeriTrust Corp.
Proposes Possible
Takeover Defenses

   AmeriTrust Corp., facing the prospect of a takeover, may be moving to erect some defenses. 

   The Cleveland-based regional bank holding company, Ohio's third-largest, said it plans to split its stock 2-for-1, raise its dividend and more than double the number of authorized but unissued shares. 
In addition, AmeriTrust said it intends to stagger the terms of its directors. 

   Analysts said the steps -- though not unusual for a regional banking concern - indicate that AmeriTrust is readying defenses against an investor group that has bought a 9.6% stake in it. 

   Jerry V. Jarrett, chairman and chief executive officer, said he will ask directors to boost to 50 cents a share from 44 cents, on a pre-split basis, the quarterly payout on common stock. 
Analysts said the proposed increase is larger than they expected. 

   AmeriTrust said it will propose to shareholders at its annual meeting May 14 the stock split and staggered terms for its 25-member board. 
The split would double the number of shares outstanding to 41.8 million. 

   In addition, the banking concern said it will ask holders to approve an increase in the number of authorized but unissued shares to 100 million -- more than double the number of shares outstanding after allowing for the split. 

   As previously reported, a group led by Alfred Lerner, a banking and real estate executive with holdings in Baltimore and Cleveland, disclosed this week that it had acquired a 9.6% stake in AmeriTrust. 
Mr. Lerner, who wouldn't say whether the group plans a takeover bid, has asked the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland for permission to buy as much as 24.9% of AmeriTrust stock. 

   An Ameritrust spokesman said the additional authorized shares may be used for a "variety of reasons" not connected to defending the company from a takeover, including acquisitions. 
The banking concern added that it still has no indication that Mr. Lerner's interest is hostile. 

   Frank Barkocy, a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets analyst, said AmeriTrust is likely to resist a takeover. 
"They feel they are developing critical mass and can choose their own partner," he said. 
He added that, given uncertainty over the Lerner group's motives, AmeriTrust appears to be "getting prepared for contingencies." 

   Jeffrey L. Cohn, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. analyst, termed AmeriTrust's actions "pretty mild" defensive measures that won't hamper any potential acquirer. 
"Even with a staggered board, AmeriTrust is amazingly free of shark repellent," he said. 

   AmeriTrust, one of the nation's most strongly capitalized banks, had $11.07 billion in assets at the end of 1986.

<HL> London Stocks Slip on U.K. Plan to Sell
British Petroleum Stake; Tokyo Declines

   London share prices declined on the news that the British government would sell its remaining 32% stake in British Petroleum Co. Tokyo stocks also fell. 

   London shares declined from trading's start in the wake of Wednesday's announcement by the government. 
The 100-share index, which edged up 0.3 point Wednesday, closed down 15.6 points, at 1991. 
The Financial Times industrial-share index fell 7.9 to 1581.6. 

   The government said the sale would be "subject to market conditions." 
It is presumed that the sale is contingent on the ruling Conservative Party winning the next election. 
A national vote must be held before June 1988 but is expected sometime this year. 

   The government will move "probably sooner rather than later" to sell the BP stake, worth the equivalent of $7.57 billion at yesterday's close, because of the recent strength in oil prices, a dealer said. 

   At that value, the sale would be the largest of the government's privatization efforts this year and would put a substantial demand on the market's financial resources, dealers said. 

   Still, it would only temporarily deter the market's upward trend, they said. 
"I don't think the bull market is over by any means," one said. 

   The 100-share index opened down 17.5 points. 
It struggled higher and was down only 6.0 shortly before noon. 
But it couldn't sustain even that level during the slack period around midday. 

   The BP news has been "used as an excuse by the market-makers to put the market a little bit lower," a dealer at County Securities said. 
"It's more marking-down of stocks by the market-makers than actual business being done." 

   "The market-makers were looking for levels at which they could do some business," a trader observed. 

   Also, investors probably wanted a few more days of reflection to get a clearer idea of the budget's impact and where British interest rates are headed, a dealer said. 

   Cadbury Schweppes was one issue that rose. 
There were rumors that General Cinema Corp. had sold its 8.3% stake in Cadbury to RJR Nabisco Inc. 

   After the close of trading in London, a General Cinema spokesman said the company doesn't comment on rumors. 
Meanwhile, a source close to the company said the rumors weren't true. 

   The gold mines index rose 6.1 points to 350.4. 

   Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks slipped in heavy trading as buying from institutional investors eased in the face of upcoming settlement and valuation dates. 

   The Nikkei stock average, which surged 190.33 points Wednesday, fell 60.74 points to 21,644.32 after two consecutive days of record closes. 

   The stock exchange index, which rose 17.05 Wednesday, fell 16.49 to 1858.31 yesterday. 
Volume was about 1.4 billion shares, down from a record 2.4 billion Wednesday. 

   The fiscal year valuation today for tokkin funds as well as half-year settlements for several large securities firms sparked widespread selling after a bullish start, traders said. 
Tokkin funds are similar to U.S. mutual funds. 
Institutions preparing for book closings also limited their buying, contributing to the drop in trading. 

   The easing turnover sidelined other investors worried about a possible correction in the Nikkei average following recent surges, traders said. 
In the 15 sessions before yesterday's, the average successively posted record-closing streaks of five days, four days and two days. 

   Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. 
To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. 
The percentage change is since year-end.

<HL> Lessons for Narcs: Haggle Over Price,
Dress the Part, Don't Say 'Perpetrator'
---

Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>

<TEXT>
   "If you're a narc, you're dead." 

   The words, uttered calmly by a menacing-looking man with a heavy black beard, hang in the bar's smoky air. 
"If you're a narc," he repeats with emphasis, "you're dead." 

   I glance at my partner for the evening, Edward Probst, a 320-pound undercover detective in a blue-jeans jacket with a pistol tucked in the small of his back. 
This type of talk shouldn't frighten me, except that tonight I, too, am a narcotics agent. 
And now I am supposed to walk outside to a parked car -- my first "solo" -- and buy a half-gram of cocaine. 

   It is the "final exam" at a class run by Professional Law Enforcement Inc., a detective agency that does drug-surveillance work for small towns, high schools and some major corporations. 
Agents of PLE, a unit of privately held Massey Burch Investment Group Inc. of Nashville, Tenn., in recent months were behind more than 200 drug and other arrests at several General Motors Corp. plants and 137 arrests at or near a Whirlpool Corp. facility in Arkansas. 
PLE let this reporter attend a two-week training course for prospective agents, at the end of which, if possible, each trainee is to make a drug buy as part of a sheriff's-department undercover operation. 

   Things go wrong as soon as we reach the car. 
"Do a snort," urges the dealer, drawing from his jacket a thimble-sized vial filled with white powder. 
"It's what you'll be buying." 

   I had practiced faking cocaine use in a hotel mirror for days in anticipation of this moment. 
But my hands tremble as I fumble with the vial and a coke spoon disguised as a key. 
Recalling a tip, I bob my head in the seat as I draw the spoon to my nose, feigning fear of being seen by passing police. 
With the dealer's gaze momentarily diverted, I sniff, a bit too violently, while secretly sliding the white powder off onto my left thumb. 
Quickly I wipe my thumb on my pants while running the spoon over my gums. 

   "You seem a little bit too much in a hurry," the dealer says. 
"That makes me nervous. 
I don't even think you snorted that. 
Mind if I see some ID?" 
Foolishly, I produce my wallet, flashing my driver's license and my library card. 

   But I balk when he suggests we snort a "line," a procedure that is very hard to fake. 
"Are we going to do the deal or not?" 
I ask, not needing to fake my fear and anger. 
"Let's just go back inside." 

   Inside, we walk to a bathroom to complete the buy. 
Here the deal is nearly blown again: Not only am I forced to run outside to break a $20 bill, but also I hand over the $50 before being given the vial, a cardinal sin for a narc. 
Still, I manage to do the deal. 

   My elation at that, however, vanishes an hour later. 
I learn that the deal was phony: The "coke" isn't coke, and the "dealer" is a PLE man. 
He is Gary Smith, a detective who later permits me to accompany him during part of an undercover drug investigation in Mason, Ohio. 

   The instructors explain that a trainee needs to be observed doing what he believes is a real drug deal. 
PLE's training, while not nearly as rigorous as the monthslong courses given federal Drug Enforcement Agency agents, is considered superior to that of many small agencies that only dabble in undercover work. 

   It is supervised by the portly Mr. Probst and another agent, Harry Sweigart. 
Mr. Probst, like a tourist checking his wallet, frequently flicks his hand to the pistol at his belt. 
He has reason to be jumpy: He has recently busted eight members of a motorcycle gang after living with two of them for months; he hears they have put a price on his head. 

   In the class besides me are two detectives and an 18-year-old woman targeted for undercover work in high schools. 
Most recruits are police officers, and the first step is to "de-cop" them. 
Shed immediately are black leather belts and black oxfords. 
The class is told to avoid jargon like "perpetrator." 
Even posture may be changed. 
"Don't walk with one arm swinging," one new agent is told. 
"It's a cop walk." 

   Trainees, between learning to identify drugs and practicing buys before a video camera, hear lectures on topics ranging from how to discourage being frisked while wearing a tape recorder ("You gay?" sometimes works) to the quickest way to test the purity of cocaine (coke rubbed between the fingers for a minute will disappear, leaving behind the "cut," any kind of powder used to dilute it). 
Tips range from the useful ("stay away from cellular phones; neighbors can listen in") to the obvious ("fistfights don't look good; plus, you may get whipped"). 

   A seminar on pretending to use cocaine is a near-fiasco. 
Scott, a beefy police reservist from Michigan, repeatedly tips a cocaine spoon, showering rivulets of Sweet 'N Low down his shirt-front. 
Instructors warn me against my habit of dusting the "cocaine" off the table top. 
"Do that for real and you'll have eight guys sniffing at your feet," one says. 

   The toughest task for some new agents, officers who may scorn drug users, is simply asking to buy drugs. 
"Some cops just can't do it," says Mr. Probst with a shrug. 
The approach should be indirect and nonthreatening. 
Not "I hear you have some coke," but "Know anybody who has some coke?" 

   And always haggle. 
"Most cops will buy anything at any price," says Mr. Sweigart. 
"Do that and you're made {exposed}. 
Talk 'em down. 
You'll look better to the dopers, and the city or company will love you for saving them money." 

   To acquire the tools of their trade, such as copies of High Times magazine to scatter around their home, new operatives visit a "head shop" filled with hundreds of carved and metal pipes, colorful glass "bongs" for pot-smoking, and drug stashes in the form of soft-drink and tennis-ball cans with screw tops. 
Don, a tough-talking homicide detective from Akron, Ohio, squats before a glass case and chooses two coke spoons and a kit for cutting cocaine. 
"Jeez," he whispers, "it's so funny standing here. 
I used to bust guys carrying this stuff and think, 'You dirtball.'" 

   Not all excursions go smoothly. 
One night Mr. Probst, who sometimes feels compelled to revisit the scenes of his buys, tows us into the darkened streets of a rundown area in West Dayton to the clubhouse of a motorcycle gang. 
A blue Gremlin pulls behind us as we drive by. 
Circling to pass again, we meet the car at an intersection. 
A bearded face reminiscent of killer Charles Manson peers into our car, craning at us as we go by. 
"Oh man, I busted that guy," Mr. Probst says. 
"Hurry up." 
Five quick turns later we leave the neighborhood. 

   "What a rush," Don says from the back seat. 

   "Really," Mr. Probst says, staring ahead, touching his gun. 

   Undercover agents spend a lot of time looking for drugs, but sometimes the drugs find them first. 
One evening a group of narcs and narc trainees gathers at a striptease bar for drinks and debriefing. 
Talk of "coke" and "buys" apparently attracts attention. 
Before long, a scantily clad dancer cozies up in a chair next to me. 

   "You like coke?" she coos. 
I nod, and negotiations begin. 
"My dealer comes in at two. 
Fifty dollars a half-gram. 
It's got crystals. 
It's just up from Florida. 
You'll love it." 

   A few detectives favor buying the drugs, but to do so would violate the rule against making a buy without clear authority from local law-enforcement officials. 
Besides, we've had plenty to drink. 
After somebody mutters, "Honey, we're cops," the group quickly walks out of the dimly lit club, leaving the would-be dealer gaping.

   In the corner of Prof. Shinichi Uchida's laboratory at the University of Tokyo, across from the bottles of liquid nitrogen, stands a bunk bed. 

   Until recently it was little used. 
Then, on Feb. 15, a University of Houston press conference announced the latest breakthrough in the science of superconductivity, a development with potentially enormous commercial applications. 

   The lab and its bunks here seldom have been empty since. 

   For three weeks Prof. Uchida's 12-researcher team worked around the clock, seven days a week to duplicate the Houston results. 
Sleeping in shifts, they cooked their meals in a tiny kitchenette while their latest batch of experimental ceramic pellets baked in the lab's kiln. 

   In other labs, in company board rooms and in the offices of the powerful Ministry of Trade and Industry, or MITI, the Houston breakthrough has galvanized Japan. 
Scientists, industrialists and government officials have responded frantically, convinced they can, and must, walk away with the commercial applications. 
"When it comes time to make something out of it," predicts Prof. Shoji Tanaka, who is Prof. Uchida's boss, "the Japanese will have the upper hand." 

   In the U.S., by contrast, the reaction has been more measured. 
Labs are busy, but there isn't any nationally coordinated drive for commercialization. 
Leaders in superconductivity research caution that much science remains to be done first. 
"You must keep in mind that the scientific scene is changing so rapidly that to decide (on specific applications) on the basis of what is known today would be a mistake," says John Armstrong, director of the research division at International Business Machines Corp. 
It would also be wrong, he thinks, "to turn this into a race between East and West." 

   Here in Tokyo, however, the race is already on, showing once again the competitive drive and speed with which Japan can seize on Western science. 

   New materials that conduct electricity at warmer temperatures with almost no loss of power, have "opened a fantastic world of future industries," says Masatoshi Urashima, a MITI official. 
Because previous superconductors operated only at extremely low and expensive-to-maintain temperatures, the new materials make economical the creation of tiny, superfast computers, magnetically floating trains, long-distance power lines that don't waste electricity and even appliances that use almost no power. 

   The discovery meshes with technologies Japan has refined for years. 
Japan has a train using superconductivity that is almost ready for commercial use. 
It travels at more than 250 miles an hour while hovering five inches above a track on a magnetic cushion created by superconducting coils. 
Japan's shipbuilders, meanwhile, have spent $23 million to build a fast ship propelled by superconducting magnets. 

   NEC Corp. and others already have produced prototypes of superconducting computer chips; the West gave up trying to do so four years ago. 
Such giant electronics concerns as Hitachi Ltd. are supplying the West with millions of dollars of superconducting equipment. 
And Japan's leading role in industrial ceramics will help it develop ceramic superconductors. 
"A lot of revolutionary things are going to come up and a lot of it is going to come from Japan," says David L. Keller, a technology analyst with James Capel &amp; Co., a British securities firm. 
"The Japanese will dramatically lead the rest of the world." 

   The Japanese government already is organizing that. 
Four days after the Houston bombshell, Japan's Science and Technology Agency announced its intent to form a research consortium of Japanese companies, universities and government labs. 
A week later, the consortium was in place, including such industrial giants as NEC, Toshiba Corp., Nippon Steel Corp. and Mitsubishi Electric Corp. "We've gathered all the leading-edge researchers in superconductivity in Japan," says Koji Yamaguchi, the agency official overseeing research. 
"We need to get everybody together to share information and decide how to move." 

   MITI, the agency that picks and funds national projects like the one that helped Japanese makers dominate the memory chip business, began moving on the day of the announcement. 
It already is polishing up an existing feasibility study on a superconducting power plant and plans to have a working model built by 1992. 

   "The objective is to organize industry to get the jump on the West in applications and commercialization for a huge new market," says Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business daily. 
The earliest application, researchers say, could be superconducting computer chips that would enable creation of a shoe box-sized supercomputer. 
IBM and most other U.S. companies abandoned research in 1983 on the chips, called Josephson Junction devices, partly because of the complications of cooling with helium. 
That left NEC, Hitachi and a MITI lab to refine the technology with little foreign competition. 

   For all the government-inspired organization, Japan's research labs didn't wait for government orders when they heard the news from Houston last month. 

   At the University of Tokyo, Mr. Uchida sat his researchers down in front of a large periodic table of the elements. 
For hours they debated which elements Houston could possibly have used. 
While they were still guessing, a rumor came over the phone that the material was fluoric. 
Students ran out and bought fluorinated chemicals. 
For three days they tried out hundreds of combinations until they found the rumor was false. 

   Acting on another tip that the Houston material was dark green, the researchers mixed all the plausible chemicals that would become green when fired, again with no success. (The material needs to be fired further until it is black, they found later.) 
Then a news report said a Chinese lab had achieved superconductivity at 100 degrees Kelvin (minus 173 degrees Celsius) using a ceramic with ytterbium in it and researchers attacked that. 
The report proved wrong -- the element was yttrium. (Ironically, the University of Tokyo lab later found, by coincidence, that ytterbium works. 
The lab patented the discovery.) 

   Finally at 2 a.m. March 1, they got superconductivity. 
"It was an other-worldly experience," says Prof. Uchida. 
They drank a toast and launched back into another week of experiments, this time to refine the resulting ceramic. 
On March 8 they announced a purified form. 
On Wednesday the lab finally took a holiday. 

   Meanwhile, labs at Tohoko University, Hokkaido University and a government research facility in Tokyo have burst forth with rapid-fire announcements of their advances in superconductivity. 
They and other labs have been snatching up the ingredients for superconductors so fast that there are shortages. 
Suppliers have run out of yttrium, for example, and labs must wait three weeks for orders to be filled. 

   Prof. Uchida's lab has been flooded by calls and visits from companies. 
Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. researchers brought in some rudimentary wire made from superconducting ceramic. 
Engineers from Toshiba, Fujitsu Ltd. and Hitachi have visited the lab to keep watch on developments."Company people have the conviction that ths s finally the real thing. 
A lot are starting to pick it up. . . . 
They see tha superconductivity is a sure thing and the want to get on to application," says rof. 
Uchida. 
"Everybody's going to be doing it -- steelmakers, cemical companies, computer makers, cement makers. 
They'll all be getting in to apply this," he says. 

   Of course, there is scientific and commercial excitement in the U.S., too, but it's less frenetic and isn't centrally controlled. 
Scientists say indications of an incipient breakthrough came as early as April 1986, when researchers at IBM's laboratory in Zurich, Switzerland, reported they had achieved superconductivity in a new class of materials, the metal oxide ceramics. 
This galvanized researchers throughout the world. 
By November, the Japanese and Chinese had confirmed the IBM discovery and by December, scientists in Houston and at American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s Bell Laboratories were reporting important advances with the new materials. 

   About 5,000 physicists jammed the ballroom of the Hilton Hotel in New York Wednesday night for an unprecedented special session on superconductors at the annual meeting of the American Physical Society. 
They listened to the presentation of 60 papers on superconductivity research done largely within the last two to three months. 
Although scientists from U.S. universities dominated the program, there were reports from IBM, Bell Labs, Westinghouse Electric Corp. and Exxon Corp. as well as from Japanese, Chinese and Canadian scientists. 

   The breakthrough generated tremendous excitement among Bell Labs scientists, says Robert A. Laudise, director of the laboratories' inorganic chemistry branch. 
"Usually, research managers are coaching people to do this or that," Mr. Laudise notes. 
"But in this case we had people coming around from all different disciplines wanting to know if there was anything in this for their area," he says. 

   "We've had a lot of people going without sleep," Mr. Laudise says. 
But he agrees with IBM's Mr. Armstrong that it's still too soon for anyone to settle on specific applications of the superconductors. 
"We're not trying to make any specific devices or systems," he says. 

   Bell Labs researchers are, however, trying to fabricate various superconducting materials into experimental devices. 
At Wednesday's APS meeting they displayed a superconductor in the form of a flexible ceramic tape that can be formed and then hardened into a shape to fit a superconducting device. 
"When you try to make things, it challenges your understanding of the materials," explains Mr. Laudise. 
While "it is mainly a scientific race . . . we're well aware of the competitive aspects" of the research, he says. 
Patent applications are filed as rapidly as possible and scientists don't always disclose all their findings in open scientific meetings, he notes. 

   Researchers at General Electric Co.'s big research and development center in Schnectady, N.Y., agree that it's too soon to jump into an industrial competition with anyone, including the Japanese. 

   "In the materials field, the events of the last several weeks have been quite spectacular, but in the applications sense, the jury is still very much out," says Michael Jefferies, manager in the center's engineering physics laboratory. 

   Until recently, the GE lab didn't have a group of scientists working on superconducting materials. 
"But we're now trying to confirm and duplicate the results that are being reported," Mr. Jefferies says. 

   Guy Donaruma, vice president for research at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, says governmental agencies and private concerns have shown a keen interest in the university's superconductivity research, which duplicated the Houston breakthrough. 

   "Wherever I go around town somebody buttonholes me and asks how we're coming along or when can we use this," Mr. Donaruma says. 
Some inquiries have come from the space and defense related agencies in the area, including the Marshall Space Flight Center and the U.S. Army Missile Command, he says. 
Some Southern utilities also have made inquiries regarding possible uses applicable to more efficient means of transmitting power, he adds. 

   In Palo Alto, Calif., where Stanford University recently announced a breakthrough in fabricating a superconducting thin film, useful in electronic devices, a news conference last week was packed with industry people. 
Several other scientists have called for more information for use in making a superpowerful magnet used by geological researchers. 
Niels Reimers, director of Stanford's technology licensing office, said, however, that he hasn't been fielding many industry inquiries. 

   In Japan, however, companies that already sell conventional superconducting wire to the U.S. have begun crash programs to commercialize the new discovery. 
Fujikura Ltd. and Sumitomo Electric, for example, say they have developed rudimentary wire out of the new ceramic, despite skepticism among some scientists that the material won't lend itself to wiremaking. 
"As makers, we've got to pick it up," says a Sumitomo spokesman. 
"And we're moving on it." 

   Like their U.S. counterparts, Japanese makers temper their euphoria with warnings that too little is known about the new ceramic superconductor to tell when and how the material will be commercialized. 

   Aside from possible problems in forming brittle ceramic into wire, the new superconductor still can't handle enough current to be used in heavy applications such as power plants. 
Superconductors also don't work well with alternating current, the type of electricity used in most of the world's power equipment. 

   But Japanese labs are convinced they can solve the problems over the next several years. 
Now that the West has made the basic breakthrough, they say, the ball is in their court. 
"It will be difficult and will take time," says Kasumasa Togano, a government scientist. 
"But that's precisely where Japan's labs and makers have the edge." 

   Still, he and other researchers admit to a twinge of hurt pride. 
"To be honest, we're following in the footsteps of the U.S.," Mr. Togano says. 
"Here, again, the originality is coming from the West. 
We have a measure of sadness about that."

<HL> Executive Style (A Special Report): Survey

Life Among the Business Elite:
A WSJ Survey of Big-Company CEOs Shows
That 1950s Style Fits Well in the 1980s</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   The American chief executive officer is a different breed. 

   He's more no-frills 1950s than Yuppified 1980s, more meat-and-potatoes than "cuisine minceur", more comfortable in blue suit, white shirt and red tie than in the fashions of the times. 

   If he were a movie star, he'd be Spencer Tracy -- not Cary Grant and certainly not one of the casually dressed and startlingly young-looking box-office biggies of today. 
Like Tracy, he carries extra weight around his waist, and like Tracy, he owns up to it. 

   He's a man for the long haul. 
Almost one-third of the 351 respondents to a Wall Street Journal survey on executive style said they have never worked for a company other than the one they now lead. 
And 43% of them were with their company for more than 16 years before becoming CEO. 

   The survey -- which targeted the CEOs of the Fortune 500 industrial companies and 350 of the Fortune 500 service companies -- found that in their personal lives as well as their business careers, these men go against the grain of the evanescent 1980s. 

   In a time when it seems that all sorts of things from automobiles to relationships don't last as long as they used to, more than 80% of the CEOs have been married only once, and roughly the same percentage have been married longer than 20 years. 
Just over a third have four or more children -- a plurality over those who have two or three. (A tiny 4% have only one child, and 2% have none.) 

   All of the survey respondents were male; so few women lead large U.S. corporations that many survey questions were written with a male respondent in mind, angering some women who read them. 
Not only has the women's movement not put women at the top of the nation's largest corporations, it also hasn't had much impact on chief executives' spouses. 
More than 90% of respondents' spouses in the survey don't work outside the home. 

   The fathers of today's CEOs had a wide range of careers -- policemen, doctors, lawyers, journalists, engineers. 
But more had business executives for fathers than anything else. 

   They come from all regions of the U.S., but none of the respondents grew up in Maine, North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Arizona, Nevada, Alaska or Hawaii. 
New York produced 15% of the chief executives, the highest single-state total. 
Just under 3% of them grew up abroad. 

   Their personal habits wouldn't surprise a Rip Van Winkle waking up after snoozing through the upheavals of the '60s and '70s -- except, perhaps, for the lack of cigarette smoke in the executive suite. 
Only 7% smoke cigarettes. 

   But they like to have a drink. 
Only 8% are teetotalers. 
For the rest, the most popular drinks are wine and Scotch. 
A martini is the drink of choice for only 7%. 

   These clearly are affluent men. 
They like expensive cars, and for all their Main Street traits, almost half of them are deserting Detroit for foreign car makes. 
Overwhelmingly, the first cars they ever bought were Fords and Chevys. 
But now, only half of them prefer U.S.-built autos. 
On their wrists, you're most likely to find a Seiko watch. 

   When they buy the blue suits, white shirts and red ties they favor, they're most likely to get them at Brooks Brothers. 
Still, a quarter of them have suits and shirts custom made, and a good sprinkling favor tailors in London or Hong Kong. 
Another sprinkling have stuck to less glamorous haberdasheries such as Wallach's. 

   But a few break away from the pattern of their peers to indulge an offbeat hobby. 
There's a bagpiper and a couple of banjo players. 
Two men list curling among their favorite sports. 
A handful relax by cooking. 
Two raise orchids, and one carves duck decoys.

   William Gates, founder and chairman of Microsoft Corp., became the personal computer industry's first billion-dollar man yesterday. 

   The 31-year-old Harvard University dropout holds 11,018,955 shares, or about a 42% stake in Microsoft, which supplies, among other things, the internal program that controls the basic functions of International Business Machines Inc.'s PC line of personal computers and compatible machines. 

   The magic number for the billion-dollar mark for Mr. Gates's stake was a share price of $90.75, and the stock rose above and dipped below that level during the day. 
Microsoft finally closed at $91.25, up $1.75, in national over-the-counter trading, which brought the value of his stake to $1,005,479,643.75. 

   Mr. Gates, who was traveling in South America, wasn't available for comment on his new distinction. 
In recent months, colleagues and competitors had begun to jokingly refer to Mr. Gates as "Billion Dollar Bill" as the paper value of his fortune swelled. 

   Mr. Gates is the biggest beneficiary of an astonishing run-up in the price of Microsoft shares. 
The shares, which first were offered to the public a little more than a year ago for $21 each, have been outpacing the booming stock markets in recent months, and have nearly doubled in value since the end of the year. 

   "Is there a premium in the stock price because of Bill Gates?" asked Richard Sherlund, an analyst who follows the company for Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. 
"I'd have to say yes, because he is considered one of the brightest people in the industry." 
Mr. Sherlund also said Microsoft's role "at the focal point of the personal computer industry" -- supplying operating system software to both IBM and other manufacturers -- has driven market enthusiasm for the stock. 

   Not even the founders of Apple Computer Inc., Steven P. Jobs and Steve Wozniak, came close to building billion-dollar fortunes in personal computers, even though they practically fathered that industry. 

   In high-technology businesses, only H. Ross Perot, who founded Electronic Data Systems Corp., now the data-processing services division of General Motors Corp., and David Packard and William Hewlett, founders of computer and scientific instrument maker Hewlett-Packard Co., have the distinction of building personal fortunes estimated to exceed $1 billion.

<HL> Senate Approves
$88 Billion Bill
For U.S. Highways

   Despite a veto threat from President Reagan, the Senate passed an $88 billion highway bill, but it postponed action on a separate measure to allow states to raise the speed limit to 65 miles an hour on most rural interstate highways. 

   The 79-17 Senate vote on the House-Senate conference report came a day after the House approved the legislation by an overwhelming 407-17. 
Both votes indicate Congress could override a presidential veto. 
The House voted separately 217-206 to permit states to raise the speed limit to 65 mph from 55 mph on most rural interstate highways. 

   The president, in his veto message to Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.), expressed "grave concerns" about the cost of the legislation -- particularly for more than 150 special highway construction projects and for mass transit programs. 

   Mr. Reagan said that over the five-year life of the bill, the mass-transit funding would exceed his budget request by $9.1 billion. 
While he noted that he "strongly" supported allowing states to raise the speed limit, he said that "overall, the measure is seriously flawed." 

   To eliminate Mr. Reagan's objections to the bill, Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) said an amendment would be offered to the speed-limit provision when it comes up on the floor, probably today. 
The amendment, he said, may be the four-year, $65 billion highway bill that the Senate passed earlier this year. 

   Although that bill greatly exceeded the administration's budget request for mass transit, it didn't contain any extra funding for special highway projects. 
The House-Senate conference report contains about $890 million in new federal funding for these projects; the money would be in addition to the states' regular shares of federal highway aid. 

   By using the speed-limit provision to amend the highway conference report, Sen. Dole would circumvent the procedural ban on amendments to conference reports and appease the administration. 
But the action, if successful, also could jeopardize the highway legislation because the House, which has fought fiercely for the special highway projects, would have to approve the changes. 

   "The bill as is, and only the bill as is, can be passed by the Congress," said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.), floor manager for the bill. 

   Administration insiders concede Sen. Dole's effort to change the highway bill by amending the speed-limit provision is a long shot. 
That's partly because senators from the West who are sympathetic to cost concerns about the highway bill don't want to jeopardize the speed-limit measure by changing it. 

   But even if Sen. Dole's gambit fails, these officials said, the exercise could help sustain a presidential veto of the highway bill later. 
The reasoning is that the Senate would be more likely to vote to sustain a veto if it were clear that the president supported the original, Senate-passed highway bill. 

   That bill would authorize about $53 billion for highways and $13 billion for mass transit over a four-year period. 
The House-Senate conference report would authorize about $70 billion for highways and $18 billion for transit over five years.

<HL> Waste Firm Says
It Will Increase
Bid for Chemlawn

   Waste Management Inc., which had said it wouldn't sweeten its $27-a-share bid for ChemLawn Corp. and had insisted the offer was "fair and fully priced," said it is ready to boost the bid to $33 a share. 

   But Wall Street didn't seem satisfied as traders drove ChemLawn's stock price above the proposed bid. 
Such activity usually indicates that the market expects a higher bid or a new suitor. 

   ChemLawn declined to comment, but a spokesman said the company was likely to respond to the offer today. 
The Columbus, Ohio-based lawn-care concern has been seeking other purchasers since earlier this month, when it rejected Waste Management's $27-a-share bid as "inadequate." 
Waste Management announced that surprise tender offer in late February. 

   Under the new plan, the Oak Brook, Ill.-based waste hauler said it would pay $33 for each of ChemLawn's about 10 million shares, or about $330 million, if ChemLawn promptly agrees to be acquired at that price. 

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, ChemLawn common shares closed at $34.125, up $2.25. 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Waste Management closed at $76.375, up $1.50. 

   A Waste Management spokesman declined to say why the company did an about-face and raised the bid. 

   "Waste Management probably initially thought $27 was high enough that it would be a pre-emptive bid," said Clarke Walser, an analyst with Chicago Corp. 
In mid-February, immediately before Waste Management's offer, ChemLawn shares were trading between $16 and $18. 
But the stock instantly jumped above Waste Management's $27-a-share offer to $29.625 bid. 
It has gradually risen since. 
Waste Management may have been worried by ChemLawn's announcement in mid-March that it was in talks with various parties on the possible sale of the company, Mr. Walser said. 

   Acquiring ChemLawn would expand Waste Management's residential-services business from trash collection into lawn spraying. 
Analysts have said that Waste Management has been looking for acquisitions in the outdoor-services industry, and the company is well-armed financially to pursue them. 
The Waste Management spokesman said the company would pay for ChemLawn with cash and short-term debt. 
He declined to elaborate.

<HL> Let Moderates Have a Say in 1988

<TEXT>
   We have witnessed startling events in U.S. foreign policy during the past year. 
The Reykjavik summit produced what appeared to be a total repudiation of America's basic security posture by proposing the total abolition of ballistic missiles by 1996. 
The Iran-contra affair repudiated America's basic position of not dealing with terrorist governments and not paying ransom for hostages. 

   These abrupt foreign-policy shifts followed less noticed but equally abrupt shifts in economic policy. 
From 1980 to 1984, the U.S. followed a deliberate policy of driving up the value of the dollar and interpreting its 50% rise as a reflection of American strength; in 1985, the U.S. shifted gears and proceeded to drive the dollar down at least as much in order to regain American competitiveness. 
To resolve the Third World debt problem, it supported an austerity policy sponsored by the International Monetary Fund from 1980 to 1984, and then switched to a growth-oriented policy in 1985. 

   Consistency, in and of itself, is not necessarily a virtue. 
But when the world's leading economic and military power shifts gears as brutally and dramatically as the U.S. has done in areas vital to its allies as well as its adversaries, the result is an inevitable loss of America's ability to provide leadership. 
To this we must add the dynamics created by a presidential election in 1988. 

   There is no purely American solution to any of our major economic problems. 
The U.S. cannot afford a recession that would drive its deficits to more than $300 billion and possibly cause a crash in the value of the dollar as well as in the stock and bond markets. 
The result could be massive domestic and international banking defaults, a world recession and political instability in large parts of the globe. 
Avoiding such a catastrophe will involve a delicate combination of coordinated domestic and international efforts: 

   --The U.S. must cut its budget deficit with new taxes and reductions in expenditures. 

   --To counteract the risk of recession, it must reduce interest rates and run an easier monetary policy. 

   --To avoid a collapse of the dollar, Japan and Europe will have to stimulate growth, cut taxes and interest rates. 

   --And to promote growth in the Third World, the U.S., Japan and Western Europe will have to agree on an aggressive plan of debt restructuring and new capital for the debtor countries. 

   It is hard to see how any of this could happen in a traditional U.S. presidential election year. 
Under normal circumstances, even if the next president were willing to embrace such an agenda it probably would not see the light of day until 1990. 
That may well be too late. 

   In the foreign-policy field, events are similarly crowding the U.S. Developments in the Soviet Union suggest a desire on the part of General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev for a massive effort to modernize the Soviet economy, which can happen only with the West's cooperation. 
For the first time since World War II, it is possible that arms-control negotiations, tied to economic and trade negotiations, could change the internal dynamics of the Soviet Union and, possibly, the overall relationship between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. 
The volatile stituation in the Middle East requires firm and steady leadership from the U.S. together with Europe, both for international security reasons and for America's coming dependence on Mideastern oil. 

   How is all this affected by next year's presidential election? 
Politicians have a tendency to re-create the last election just as generals have a tendency to fight the last war. 
By that wisdom, on the domestic front, the Democratic presidential candidates will refuse to discuss any increase in taxes and the Republican candidates will duck the issue of possible cutbacks in Social Security and other entitlements. 
That will clearly doom any serious action on the budget deficit until 1990. 

   On the international front, neither Democrats nor Republicans will want to deal with Third World debt restructuring while the farm sector, the energy sector and other parts of the U.S. economy are in difficulty. 
As for American ties with the Soviets, Republicans will outdo each other as to hawkishness and Democrats will fear to be perceived as "soft on communism." 

   The presidential candidates in 1988 will have to decide whether to be realistic and truthful about what the U.S. is facing, thereby running the risk of political suicide. 
Or, they will have to make promises they cannot possibly keep and, therefore, be unable to govern if elected. 

   One way to avoid these alternatives would be to try to create a consensus among moderate Republican and Democratic leaders on certain aspects of an agenda for the next president. 
This could be done by establishing a bipartisan congressional commission modeled on the Temporary National Economic Commission set up by Franklin Roosevelt in 1938 to study the country's economic problems. 

   The commission could consist of, say, four members of Congress, four businessmen and four academicians. 
They would be evenly split between Republicans and Democrats and would represent ideologically moderate wings of their parties. 
Their task would be to identify the main issues and to establish the next president's priorities. 
Even if the commission did not reach a consensus on how to solve the major economic problems, it could lay out options that could influence the campaign debate. 

   With respect to the deficit, the alternatives of higher income taxes or new types of consumption taxes would leave a great deal of room for argument -- as would mechanisms to make certain that new taxes do not translate into new spending. 
When it comes to trade, the options would probably include a further lowering of the dollar, temporary tariffs, or some forms of limited industrial policies. 
As for interest rates and the Federal Reserve, the commission could debate monetary policy and, one would hope, come up with an unanimous recommendation to continue Paul Volcker for another term. 

   With respect to entitlements, the alternative of means testings or taxing affluent recipients should be examined. 
And as for Third World debt, the options could include government involvement as part of a major restructuring program of the type recommended by Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.) or the continuation of rollovers together with some version of the current Baker Plan. 

   While a commission would provide a reasonable framework for debate of the economic alternatives and allow the candidates to present their vision of America within such a framework, it would also provide the domestic framework within which Americans could debate the critical foreign-policy issue of the 1988 campaign -- namely, America's long-term relationship with the Soviet Union. 

   In the final analysis, the next president will be elected on the voters' belief in his character and his competence. 
If the country wishes to elect a radical of the right or of the left, so be it. 
But if the country wishes to elect a moderate, at least let us provide him with some of the tools to do the job: a realistic program for his election and bipartisan support for his governance.

   LTV Corp. agreed to revise its cash management procedures, satisfying its unsecured creditors and allowing it to secure $100 million of new bank financing. 

   The complex bank financing agreement, which is expected to be filed today in bankruptcy court in New York, had drawn objections from LTV's unsecured creditors and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal agency that insures corporate pensions, because it tinkered with some aspects of LTV's cash management procedures while leaving others alone. 

   The big steel, aerospace and energy concern has been operating since last July with protection from creditors' lawsuits, under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, while it works out a plan to pay debt. 
Since the financing package was first filed with the court last December, bankers, creditors and LTV officials have spent hundreds of hours at the bargaining table reworking the cash management procedures. 

   As part of the initial agreement between LTV and the 22-member bank group, the company had agreed to restrict the profits it would funnel from its successful aerospace and defense unit to its troubled steel and energy products units. 
In the first year, LTV could transfer $77 million from the aerospace and defense unit to the parent company, plus 50% of the unit's profits in future years. 

   That aspect of the accord wasn't changed, the banks and creditors said. 
Most of the changes involved reporting mechanisms, whereby LTV has agreed to provide detailed information to its creditors about many of its cash transfers, they said. 
LTV declined to comment until the agreement is filed with the bankruptcy court. 

   With the revisions, a creditors' spokesman said, "If any movement is made that we feel impairs the ability of the unsecured creditors to protect their interests, we'll have enough notice to go into court." 

   The pension agency, which has taken over LTV's four big steel pension funds, also had been concerned that the banks' agreement to repackage about $435 million of secured debt and letters of credit constituted a reorganization plan of sorts. 
Attorneys representing LTV's banks said language in the agreement was changed and clarified to make it clear that the debts were still considered to be so-called pre-petition claims, which can't be paid outside of a formal reorganization plan. 

   LTV's Chapter 11 filing cited huge interest and pension costs, and continuing problems at its beleaguered steel unit, the nation's second-largest. 
The company plans to reorganize around its aerospace and defense unit. 

   LTV had urged quick approval of the agreement in January, saying it needed the new $100 million in financing for letters of credit to support foreign sales of military and drilling equipment.

Settles SEC Market Manipulation Charge

   Boyd L. Jefferies, chairman of Jefferies Group Inc., the Los Angeles-based brokerage firm that pioneered off-market trading and became a major force in takeovers, agreed to plead guilty to two felony counts of securities law violations. 

   And, according to people familiar with the government's investigation, Mr. Jefferies also has implicated others in the securities industry's rapidly widening scandal, including individuals believed to have manipulated the price of an offering by American Express Co. of Fireman's Fund Corp. securities last year. 

   Mr. Jefferies also settled, without admitting guilt, related charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that he engaged in multiple violations of securities laws as a participant in a market manipulation scheme, and in a separate scheme with takeover speculator Ivan F. Boesky to "park" stock. 

   Parking stock occurs when an investor buys stock for another who doesn't want to be identified as the owner. 
The SEC charged that, in certain cases, Mr. Jefferies helped mask Mr. Boesky's identity, and that in others the arrangement was reversed. 

   The developments are dramatic confirmation that the government's investigation has moved far beyond insider trading. 
People familiar with the investigation said Mr. Jefferies, who is cooperating fully with the government, has described other instances of parking and stock manipulation, suggesting that the illegal practices have been widespread on Wall Street. 

   In a letter to shareholders of publicly traded Jefferies Group, Mr. Jefferies, who resigned yesterday as chairman, said, "I fully accept sole responsibility for these transactions" and "it is with deep personal sorrow and regret that I leave the company that has been my life for the past 25 years." 
He emphasized that neither he nor the company engaged in insider trading and didn't breach "any trust or confidence placed in us by our customers." 

   As part of his settlement, the 56-year-old Mr. Jefferies was barred from the securities industry for at least five years and placed his personal 13% stake in Jefferies Group in a voting trust. 

   Frank Baxter, 50, who has been president and chief operating officer of Jefferies, became the new chief executive. 

   In national over-the-counter trading, Jefferies's shares closed at $11, down 25 cents. 

   The SEC also censured Jefferies &amp; Co., the company's securities trading unit, and ordered the unit to retain an outside consultant to review its procedures designed to detect violations of securities laws. 
No fines were imposed. 
On Wall Street, the penalties were generally deemed to be light, given the scope of the offenses charged, and suggest that Mr. Jefferies's cooperation is important to the government. 

   The market manipulation charge was the most startling of the offenses alleged yesterday by the SEC because it has nothing to do with Mr. Boesky or insider trading, and implicates other individuals and firms. 
Mr. Jefferies was charged with manipulating the price of a stock involved in a 1986 secondary public stock offering at the request of an unnamed person. 
Allegedly, he bought huge blocks of the stock at or near the close of trading to boost its price, thereby affecting the price of the public offering the next day. 

   The SEC refused to identify the person or the companies involved. 
But people familiar with the government's investigation said the transaction described is an eight-million unit offering of stock and warrants of Fireman's Fund by American Express last May. 
American Express received $332 million from the offering, which was underwritten by a syndicate led by Salomon Brothers Inc. and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., an American Express subsidiary. 

   According to the SEC charges, Jefferies, at the request of the unnamed individual, agreed to drive up the stock price by buying the blocks. 
In return, the person agreed to indemnify Jefferies for any loss incurred in buying and holding the stock. 
Jefferies subsequently sold its shares at a loss and was reimbursed. 
To disguise the payment, Jefferies issued a fraudulent invoice to the person for alleged "investment banking services," and later, at the person's request, issued another fraudulent invoice to someone else. 

   The people familiar with the case wouldn't identify any of the individuals involved, but said the person who initiated the arrangement had ties to officials of American Express. 
The SEC noted that the issuer had received firm commitments from its underwriters for the offering, meaning that the underwriters bore the risks of any decline in the price of the stock just before the offering. 

   Neither American Express, Shearson, Salomon nor any individuals at those firms were charged with wrongdoing in connection with the Jefferies case. 
Both the SEC and the U.S. attorney's office said investigations of the offering are continuing. 

   Spokesmen for American Express and Salomon Brothers declined to comment. 

   The "parking" charges, while extensive, came as less of a surprise. 
This newspaper reported last November that Mr. Jefferies was under investigation, and later disclosed that a $3 million payment from Ivan F. Boesky Corp. to Jefferies was being examined by the SEC as part of a suspected parking scheme. 
That invoice, purportedly for "investment advisory and corporate financial services," was identified yesterday by the SEC as an important part of the alleged parking scheme between Mr. Boesky and Mr. Jefferies. 
The similar fraudulent invoice prepared by Mr. Jefferies in connection with the market manipulation scheme is entirely separate, the SEC alleged. 

   As alleged by the SEC, Boesky and Jefferies entities secretly held stock positions belonging to the other, and agreed to "buy back" the positions and reimburse each other for carrying costs and any losses incurred on the holdings. 
Periodically, the two netted out the profits on the holdings, the SEC charged. 

   The agency charged that in one instance last March, involving a $27 million, 500,000-share position in G.D. Searle &amp; Co. parked by Mr. Boesky with Jefferies, the price dropped about $7 a share, and Mr. Jefferies demanded that Mr. Boesky buy back the stake and repay him immediately for part of the loss. 
Mr. Boesky did so, giving Mr. Jefferies the payment of about $3 million, and Mr. Jefferies in turn supplied Mr. Boesky with the phony invoice, the SEC charged. 

   The SEC charged that besides Searle, Mr. Boesky parked with Jefferies an $11.7 million, 810,000-share position in Cooper Laboratories Inc. and a $17.3 million, 600,000-share position in Southland Financial Corp. 

   Mr. Jefferies, in turn, parked with Boesky entities positions in American Broadcasting Cos., Ideal Basic Industries Inc., ITT Corp., Phillips Petroleum Co., Pioneer Corp. and Texas Oil &amp; Gas Corp. -- a total of $43 million in stock -- the SEC alleged. 

   As reported, the SEC is also examining a $5.3 million payment last March from Ivan F. Boesky Corp. to Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
After the payment was made and questioned by Mr. Boesky's auditors, Drexel, a major securities firm, sent Mr. Boesky an invoice for "consulting and advisory services." 

   The government is seeking to determine whether the payment was actually part of a parking arrangement involving Mr. Boesky and Drexel similar to the one between Messrs. 
Boesky and Jefferies, according to persons familiar with the investigation. 
Drexel has repeatedly characterized the payment as an "investment banking fee" and denied any impropriety. 
Mr. Jefferies is understood to be providing new details about Drexel's relationship with Jefferies. 

   At a news conference yesterday afternoon, U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said Mr. Jefferies will plead guilty "in the very near future" to a criminal violation of margin requirements and aiding and abetting the falsification of the records of a Boesky-controlled brokerage house. 
He said it was Mr. Boesky who first implicated Mr. Jefferies. 

   As reported, Mr. Boesky has agreed to plead guilty to one felony charge for his role in the scandal. 
Mr. Giuliani added that the relationship between the Jefferies case and the massive insider-trading scandal "will become clearer in the next couple of weeks." 

   The SEC said that, among other provisions, Mr. Jefferies violated anti-fraud laws, disclosure requirements, books and record-keeping provisions, net capital requirements and margin requirements. 

   As the Justice Department's charges reflect, willful violations of many provisions of the securities laws are criminal offenses. 
While these laws have long been on the books, many on Wall Street have taken a cavalier attitude toward the more technical aspects of securities laws. 

   Peter H. Morrison, a partner in the New York law firm of Morrison Cohen &amp; Singer, Mr. Jefferies' lawyer, noted that Mr. Jefferies "was accommodating customers. 
He grew up in the business accommodating customers. 
The rules are changing."

   Clorox Co. said Henkel KGaA plans to increase its Clorox common stock holdings to as much as 30% from a current stake of 24.7%. 

   Dusseldorf, West Germany-based Henkel will acquire the shares through purchases on the open market, Clorox said, and won't increase its position beyond 30% "for the foreseeable future." 

   Clorox quoted the West German concern as saying Henkel views its holdings in the company as an investment, and has no plans to take an active role in Clorox management. 
Henkel will continue to have two representatives on Clorox's 15-member board. 

   A spokesman said Clorox views Henkel's increased stake as "a good development for the company and its shareholders." 
He cited a joint venture the two concerns operate in Spain and technology exchanges between the companies as evidence of the "close relationship" between them. 

   Clorox is a grocery products concern that also makes paints, stains and products for the food-service industry. 
Henkel produces household products and chemical specialties. 

   Henkel currently owns 23%, or an indicated 6,102,000, of Clorox's 26.7 million common shares outstanding. 
The West German concern also holds a subordinated note convertible into 600,000 common shares, or an about 1.7% additional stake. 

   Clorox said the 30% ceiling on Henkel's stake would include the equivalent shares represented by the note. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Clorox closed yesterday at $61.50, up $2.125.

Gleason to Retire

   Longshoremen union chief Thomas W. "Teddy" Gleason will retire when his term expires in July. 

   The International Longshoremen's Association, of which Mr. Gleason has been president since 1963, said he will announce his retirement today at a meeting of the union's 26-member executive council in Tampa, Fla. 
The ILA said its 86-year-old leader will recommend John M. Bowers, the union's executive vice president, 61, to be named as his successor. 

   One New York shipping industry source described Mr. Gleason as "one of the toughest negotiators around, right out of the '30s." 
The source suggested that if Mr. Bowers does replace Mr. Gleason, he will reign in the same manner, "although he's more low-key . . . 
Bowers has been executive vice president for as long as Teddy has been president." 

   A third-generation dockworker, Mr. Gleason, a native New Yorker, first joined the union, which represents dockworkers on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, in 1919. 
Through the years, Mr. Gleason led the union in several strikes resulting in negotiations that elevated the pay and benefits for longshoremen. 
They now earn $17 an hour, or about $32,300 a year. 

   The New York Shipping Association called Mr. Gleason "a forceful and effective advocate of the interest of his union members." 

   Nowadays, there are fewer longshoremen's jobs. 
The increased use of containerized shipping, where cargo is loaded into containers and then shipped directly to the destination, has eliminated much of the handling of cargo at the docks. 
The local longshoremen's membership in New York Harbor, as high as 31,574 in 1955, has now shrunk to about 7,312 members. 

   For years, some of the union's officials have been identified by law enforcement officers as members or associates of organized crime. 
In 1981, when Mr. Gleason testified before a Senate subcommittee investigating racketeering on the waterfront, he denied accusations that he was influenced by organized crime. 

   One of the high points in his career was in the mid-1960s, when Mr. Gleason helped the union negotiate a contract with guaranteed annual-income provisions. 
In the latest round of negotiations, held in 1986, the union was forced to accept wage concessions in order to be competitive with the growing number of low-cost nonunion stevedoring operations. 
Under the 1986 contract, the union agreed to a wage freeze for the first two years. 

   James Kirk, director of the port department of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, noted that the new ILA union leadership will contend with a membership no longer unified under a master wage contract. 
In the latest round of negotiations, ILA union membership at different ports negotiated separate contracts. 
For shippers, the regional differences in the ILA salaries "will become a factor in the cost of doing business," Mr. Kirk said. 
"It changes the basic ground rules."

<HL> President Is Viewed as Too Set in His Ways
To Change His Governing Style, Poll Shows

<TEXT>
   Most Americans feel that President Reagan is increasingly less relevant to the governing of the country, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll indicates. 

   The nationwide survey, which was conducted from Sunday through Tuesday, suggests that Mr. Reagan's recent efforts to reinvigorate his presidency haven't convinced people that he can regain his standing as a strong national leader. 
Rather, many seem to regard him as being too uninvolved in decision making, and unlikely to change. 

   When the 2,153 adults in the poll were asked to choose who they thought will exert the most influence on the policies and decisions made in the White House during the next two years, Mr. Reagan finished third, behind new White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker and members of the cabinet. 
Only 27% thought Mr. Reagan would have the most influence over his own White House. 

   Moreover, most people don't believe that Mr. Reagan is capable of changing his management style to meet the criticisms of the Tower Commission's devastating report on the Iran-Contra affair. 
Fully 56% said the president is "too set in his ways" to change, while 40% said he will alter his management style. 

   That finding follows Mr. Reagan's efforts since the report was issued to show that he is taking command -- efforts that have included the replacement of former Chief of Staff Donald Regan with Mr. Baker, a nationally televised speech and the appointment of FBI Director William Webster to be director of central intelligence. 
Despite all those steps, though, 54% of those polled said Mr. Reagan doesn't pay enough attention to major policy issues involving his administration, up from 46% in January. 

   The poll wasn't all bad news for the president. 
Fifty-two percent of those polled say they look to Mr. Reagan for "leadership on the direction the country is going." 
And 65% now believe that he is healthy and vigorous enough to be an effective president during the next two years, up from 60% in a Journal/NBC poll in January. 

   But more than three-quarters of those polled think the president isn't as strong a leader now as he was during his first term, and a majority -- 54% -- now say his performance as president is "only fair" or "poor." 
In January, 50% gave him such unfavorable marks. 

   As in the January poll, Americans still believe by a 2-to-1 margin that Mr. Reagan isn't as fully in charge of his administration as he ought to be. 
The public now is even less convinced that he is doing all he can to solve the problems created by the sale of arms to Iran: 46% say yes, 49% say no. 
In January, 50% said yes and 42% said no. 
However, 52% don't think he should resign even if it turns out that he knew about the diversion of funds to the Contras, while 41% say he should. 

   There's little good news for the president on policy matters, according to the poll. 
His policy of aiding the Nicaraguan Contras remains very unpopular: 58% disapprove, and 29% approve. 

   And most say they want a budget compromise with Congress to reduce the federal budget deficit even if it results in a tax increase, which Mr. Reagan adamantly opposes. 
The poll found that 53% favor a compromise even if it includes a tax increase, while 40% don't favor such a compromise. 

   Mr. Reagan's problems seem to have spilled over to the Republican Party. 
Those polled are almost evenly divided about which party can best handle the nation's economic problems and relations with the Soviet Union; in the January poll, they gave the GOP a strong edge in both areas. 
Republicans also have lost ground and now hold only a marginal advantage in the public's rating of which party would better handle inflation and the federal budget deficit. 

   In foreign affairs, the poll shows, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's public-relations efforts seem to have had an impact on Americans as well as Russians. 
While most of those polled still don't believe the Soviets can be trusted to live up to an agreement to relax tensions, the gap is narrowing. 
Fifty-nine percent now say the Soviets can't be trusted, while 32% say they can; in a similar Journal/NBC poll last October, the margin was 74% to 16%. 

   Nearly half say the arrival of Howard Baker as the new chief of staff makes an agreement on controlling nuclear arms more likely in the next two years, while 18% think it will make an agreement less likely and 12% think it won't have any effect. 

   But there still hasn't been any burst of public optimism that such an accord will actually be attained by the end of Mr. Reagan's term. 
More than three times as many people think such an accord isn't likely at all as believe it is very likely -- a ratio that is unchanged from last October's survey. 

   ---
   'During the next two years, whom do you think will have the most influence on the policies and decisions made in the White House?' 

   White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker 31% 

    Cabinet members                                   29%
   President Reagan 27% 

    Nancy Reagan                                       6%
   Not sure 7% 

   'As you may know, the Tower Commission report on the Iran-Contra affair criticized some of President Reagan's management practices within the White House. 
Do you think Mr. Reagan will change his management style, or do you think he is too set in his ways to change?'

Early to Bed...
The Motto of Ben Franklin Has Become
The M.O. of Many a Chief Executive

Compiled by Wall Street Journal Staff Reporter

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Minnesota financier Irwin Jacobs leaves the office every day at 5:30 p.m. -- or 5:45 p.m. if necessary. 
He doesn't think hanging around the office late is a good idea, and he rarely works weekends. 

   But the chairman of Minstar Inc., an investment group he controls, puts in a full day's work nonetheless. 
He reports to his desk at 7 a.m. each day, having already finished the morning newspapers and checked up on Europe through a call from his car phone. 

   Chief executive officers are a hardworking lot, but you may not know it by looking at them. 
You may still be in bed when they're getting their best work done. 
A lot of CEOs, it seems, think they perform best before the sun comes up, the coffee wagon comes around, or subordinates come in with phone messages, memos and meetings. 

   Forty-hour weeks are rare for those at the top; fifty and more hours are more the norm. 
In a Wall Street Journal survey of chief executives of the nation's largest corporations, nearly two-thirds said they worked between 10 and 11 hours a day, Monday through Friday. 
Most of them also reported working on weekends; nearly 60% claimed between one and five hours of weekend work. 

   How do they cope? 
CEOs make time where they can find it. 
They work in cars, trains and planes. 
They mull strategy in the shower, plot planning by the pool. 
Their hardest task: Finding time for themselves. 

   Mr. Jacobs gets up at 5:30 a.m. to get everything he wants done. 
But he's by no means the earliest bird among his peers. 
Fred Carr, chairman of First Executive Corp., awakens around 5 a.m., and Gordon McGovern, president and chief executive of Campbell Soup Co., routinely rises at 4:30 a.m. 
"I grew up in the baking business where you get up early to deliver the bread," he says. 

   It isn't always easy. 
Kenneth Monfort, chief executive officer of Monfort of Colorado Inc., a beef packing concern, starts his day at 7 a.m. to get a jump on cattle futures markets, which are important for his business. 
"I'm not a good waker-upper. 
I can barely talk when I get up and I practice talking to myself on the way to work," he says. 

   By coming in early, chief executives avoid, for a time, the demands of the bureaucracy. 
"All day long there's a constant stream of people coming through my office telling me what's going on," says Mr. McGovern, who does a few hours' work at home before reporting to work at 7:30 a.m. Agrees Jack Reichert, chairman, president and chief executive of Brunswick Corp.: "I like a little quiet at the beginning of the day and at the end to maintain my sanity." 

   One problem: Too many other people are catching on to the trick. 
"I find I have emigrated to the country of breakfast meetings," says Robert B. Horton, chairman and chief executive of Standard Oil Co., who until last April was a top executive at British Petroleum in London, where such meetings were unusual. 

   "In London I would get to the office by 8 or 8:15 and have a full hour before the telephone rang. 
Now I get in at 7:30 and I'm lucky to have 15 minutes." 

   Traveling takes a big chunk of a CEO's time. 
Chief Executive magazine reports that its readers take, on average, 24 business trips a year. 
"In the past seven or eight months, I've taken more than one airplane flight a day, on average," says Charles E. Cobb Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of Arvida Disney Corp., a unit of Walt Disney Co. 

   B. Charles Ames, chairman and chief executive of Acme-Cleveland Corp., averages just two days a week in the office. 
The rest of the time he's visiting facilities around the world. 
Some recent visits included a plant near the Black Forest in Germany and one just outside London. 
"It's very important to spend time in the field with the first-line people," he says. 

   Evenings are often work times, too. 
"When I leave the office, I often don't go home," says James Sylla, president of Chevron U.S.A. Inc., a unit of Chevron Corp. 
On Monday of one recent week he had a meeting in Tulsa; on Wednesday he had dinner with a company management development team back in San Francisco; on Thursday there was a reception and dinner for some Japanese contractors; and on Friday he attended a dinner honoring retirees. 
Tuesday night he goofed off and went to a ball game. 

   Some chief executives stop just short of making the office their home. 
While he tries not to use his apartment at General Motors Corp. headquarters, Chairman Roger Smith does eat breakfast at work to save time. 
Warren L. Batts, chairman and chief executive of Premark International Inc., a Northbrook, Ill.-based maker of consumer and restaurant products, arrives early and exercises at the company. 

   Others bring part of the office home. 
Mr. Cobb does long-term planning in the shower. 
Paul Frison, president and chief executive at LifeCell Corp., a medical supplies company in Houston, dictates memos while watching "the more boring part of a baseball game." 
And on weekends, he says, if he didn't do paper work by the pool, his wife and children "would think I was ill." 

   Donald Frey, chairman and chief executive of Bell &amp; Howell Co., thinks about work problems while making cabinets, beds and tables at home. 
He scribbles ideas down on nearby napkins or on shreds of newspapers. 
Later, he says, "I take these odd-looking pieces of paper with notes on them, and write them out nicely." 

   "I deliberately live close to the office so I don't waste a lot of time commuting," says Mr. Batts of Premark International. 
Others turn the commute into part of the workday. 
Mr. Horton of Standard Oil is driven to work from his home about 40 minutes east of the company's Cleveland office; the drive gives him "more than an hour of productive time" a day. 

   Samuel J. Heyman, chairman and chief executive of GAF Corp., in Wayne, N.J., commutes to work by helicopter from his Westport, N.J., home, cutting the two-hour commute to a half-hour. (He picks up the tab himself.) 

   Most CEOs say they like their schedules. 
"I'm thrilled to death that I'm able to work," says Beverly F. Dolan, chairman, president and chief executive of Textron Inc., who puts in a 10 1/2-hour workday. 
"Work isn't work as a negative. 
Being able to work is a pleasure. 
I truly enjoy what I do." 
Dean Morton, chief operating officer of Hewlett-Packard Co., agrees: "Stress is caused by the things you haven't done -- not the things you're doing." 

   But others, while they enjoy their work, feel there's a lot of it. 
"I don't feel overworked or overburdened," says David Kosowsky, chairman and chief executive of Damon Corp., a medical equipment concern. 
"But sometimes I feel like I'm always here."

   Here's some practical advice from CEOs on how to save
time:
   -- Warren E. McCain, chairman and chief executive,
Albertson's Inc., a grocery and drugstore chain: "Avoid trade
association meetings. Take a speed-reading course."
   ---
   -- Donald Kingsborough, chairman and chief executive,
Worlds of Wonder Inc., a toymaker: "Hire the very best senior
managers possible."
   ---
   -- Fred Carr, chairman, First Executive Corp., a life
insurance holding company: "If you bunch your meetings
between 4 and 6 p.m., you tend to have shorter meetings. A 4
p.m. meeting always ends at ten minutes to five. Promptly."
   ---
   -- Henry Wendt, president and chief executive, SmithKline
Beckman Corp., a pharmaceutical company: "Get a damn good
secretary."
   ---
   Of course, a determined chief executive can turn almost
any activity -- even sleeping -- into work. Ernest M. Wuliger
likes to stay in bed until 8 a.m., arriving at the office
around 10. What's more, he likes to turn in before 10:30 p.m.
"I'm in the mattress business," says the chairman and chief
executive officer of Ohio Mattress Co. "I'm going to enjoy my
product."

<HL> First Lady's Anti-Drug Efforts
Aim to Reverse Image Damage

   With President Reagan now largely recovered from his prostate surgery, his wife Nancy took to the road, partly to heal her own wounds. 

   Bruised by negative publicity surrounding her not-so-behind-the-scenes efforts to oust then White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan last month, the first lady yesterday returned to a less controversial role: addressing the Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education's annual conference in Atlanta, part of stepped-up travel plans for the next few months. 

   "She's going to jump on the drug bandwagon, get out on the road and stop minding the store," says one Republican official knowledgeable about the first lady's strategy to counter recent unfavorable reviews. 
"It's partly because her husband is better. 
But it's also a lot of damage control." 

   Not so, says Elaine Crispen, Mrs. Reagan's spokeswoman. 
"It's not new -- anything suggesting we're changing her image is just malarky." 
She notes that Mrs. Reagan's drug efforts are longstanding. 
And she asserts that the first lady's image doesn't need any burnishing. 

   But a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll conducted from Sunday through Tuesday suggests the first lady plainly has been hurt by the public's growing perception that she has too much influence over her husband. 
Of those polled, an unusually high 39% thought the president lets himself be influenced too much by his wife, 53% didn't think so and 8% weren't sure. 
Mrs. Reagan still enjoys a high 61% overall approval rating, but that has fallen 13 points since last April and her disapproval rating has more than tripled to 26%. 

   While only 8% of those polled thought Mrs. Reagan should wield "a great deal of influence," 38% thought that she currently does, a jump of 16 points since last April. 
But if many think she's too influential, still only a small minority, 6%, think that over the next two years she'll be the main power in the White House. 

   Confidants of the first lady say that she has been frustrated and hurt by the drubbing she received in the days surrounding Mr. Regan's Feb. 27 resignation, and she has been anxious to limit any damage. 
After New York Times columnist William Safire's March 2 column charging that her "political interference" was making her husband "appear wimpish and helpless," Mrs. Reagan sought advice about what to do from friends inside and outside the White House, among them presidential pollster Richard Wirthlin. 

   Mr. Wirthlin declines to discuss any meetings he might have had with the first lady. 
But sources close to the two say that it was agreed that the best tack for Mrs. Reagan to take was to return with renewed vigor to the drug issue, and to be very careful about appearing to meddle in substantive policy issues. 
Whatever else she does, she must not, as one source put it, "go pounding on (new White House Chief of Staff) Howard Baker every day." 

   In this effort to improve her image, Mrs. Reagan has had a lot of help, both from a spontaneous backlash brought on by media overkill and also from some old friends who led the way on her defense. 
One of them, Director Charles Z. Wick of the U.S. Information Agency, suggests that without ever being asked to, her supporters launched a virtual public-relations campaign. 
"It was like what we call a 'propaganda alert,'" says Mr. Wick. 
"You counter it (the negative publicity) the same way you counter Soviet disinformation: You send out the truth to as widespread an audience as possible." 

   Thus Mr. Wick and other friends of the first lady fanned out across a dizzying array of television and radio talk shows, at the same time filling the op-ed pages and political columns of some of the most prestigious journals in the nation. 
Mr. Wick did five television appearances in less than a week. 
Mrs. Reagan's former press secretary, Sheilah Tate, hit the television circuit and also co-authored an op-ed piece for the New York Times with one of the first lady's longtime friends, Nancy Reynolds. 
Mrs. Reagan was shown an advance copy and gave it her blessing. 

   Similarly, pundit George Will, who had one of his celebrated lunches recently with Mrs. Reagan, devoted part of his March 6 Washington Post column to her defense. 
While he criticized her husband for displaying "an essentially passive presidential function" in the Iran-Contra affair, he mocked the first lady's critics. 
He also offered a helpful example of her reluctance to meddle, suggesting that when Howard Baker asked Mrs. Reagan her opinion of the appointment of William Webster to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency, "she recoiled, saying she did not want to have opinions about everything." 

   In the process of championing Mrs. Reagan's right to play a role in her husband's affairs, her defenders have stirred an outpouring of anti-sexist sentiment, not Mrs. Reagan's usual cause. 
The first lady's staff has wryly enjoyed the fact that even the Washington Post columnist Judy Mann, a tough critic in the past, on March 6 called President Reagan "a lucky man" for being married to Nancy. 

   And in making the case for a strong-willed wife, Mrs. Reagan's champions may have reopened the so-called gender gap. 
More women than men, 65% vs. 57% according to the most recent poll, approve of her. 
"There are a lot of unsung, powerful wives out there who understand," suggests Michele Davis, executive director of the Republican Governors Association. 
And apparently, a lot of husbands who don't.

Aide Pleads Guilty
In Criminal Case

   Gary Eder, formerly a top stockbroker at PaineWebber Inc., pleaded guilty to criminal charges of conspiracy and creation of false brokerage records. 

   Mr. Eder, who resigned as a PaineWebber vice president last month, admitted in Manhattan federal court yesterday that he helped various wealthy customers of the firm hide at least $700,000 from the Internal Revenue Service. 
Mr. Eder was indicted on the charges last week. 

   Attorneys for Mr. Eder strongly disputed the government's characterization of the crime last week as a "money-laundering scheme." 
One attorney, Michael Feldberg, said the case was unrelated to insider trading or possible laundering of illegal profits. 
He said Mr. Eder was only helping customers avoid paying taxes. 
"The acts occurred years ago before any of the current Wall Street hysteria," Mr. Feldberg said. 

   As part of a plea agreement, Mr. Eder, 41 years old, is cooperating in a continuing investigation. 
The government said the money scheme occurred with the "approval and participation" of other PaineWebber supervisors at the branch at 1221 Ave. of the Americas in Manhattan. 

   In his appearance before federal Judge Edmund L. Palmieri, Mr. Eder said he "absolutely" was guilty of the two counts. 
"I'd like to get these charges behind me and move forward with my life," he said. 

   Though he said he didn't profit directly from the scheme, Mr. Eder told Judge Palmieri that the series of transactions did generate extra brokerage commissions for himself. 

   Mr. Eder, of Woodmere, N.Y., was PaineWebber's most highly paid broker and its biggest producer, at any office, from 1982 to 1986, according to the government. 

   Judge Palmieri released Mr. Eder on his own recognizance and set sentencing for May 27. 
Mr. Eder faces a maximum 10 years in prison and a $260,000 fine. 

   Separately, Bentley P. Whitfield, a former account executive and broker at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., pleaded innocent in Manhattan federal court to mail fraud charges filed against him last week. 
Mr. Whitfield, 31 years old, denied charges that he diverted $8,400 intended for Merrill Lynch to his own use. 
Mr. Whitfield was released on his own recognizance pending a trial.

Life After the Top:
Retired Chiefs Discover That There's
A New World Outside the Corner Office
---
By Linda M. Watkins</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Life at the top isn't easy. 
But life after life at the top poses problems, too. 

   The big question: What to do in retirement? 

   Running a Fortune 500 company often isn't just a job, but a way of life. 
At times exhilarating, at times numbing, it's an endless series of meetings, of multimillion-dollar decisions, of 60-hour workweeks, of business breakfasts, lunches and dinners. 

   For some, retirement is a welcome and well-earned respite, a time to slow down and do things they never had time to do before. 
But for others, a life of leisure is a life of boredom. 
Indeed, many retired top executives return to business within six months, according to a 1984 study by Russell Reynolds Associates Inc., an executive recruiting firm. 
"Leaving it all behind could be a blow to the ego if the individual hasn't accepted the move," says David Merrill, who counseled executives before he himself retired from Rohrer, Hibler &amp; Replogle, a consulting firm. 

   A glimpse at four former chief executive officers of Fortune 500 companies -- one who really has retired, one who is working as hard as ever, one who left corporate life abruptly at age 55 and one who is championing business solutions for social problems -- shows how different retirement can be. 

   ---
   On a recent winter day, the temperature hovered around the freezing mark in Pittsburgh, home of Westinghouse Electric Corp. 
But it was a balmy 75 degrees in the Naples, Fla., area, home of Robert Kirby, the company's 68-year-old retired chairman. 

   He got up at 6 a.m., browsed through the newspaper, did the crossword puzzle and monitored his stocks. 
After perusing his mail, it was out to the golf course adjacent to his spacious Spanish villa-style home for a four-hour round with friends. 
In the late afternoon he returned home, taped some music (big band jazz is his favorite, and he has 3,000 tapes) and enjoyed a quiet dinner (hot dogs and baked beans). 
Then Mr. Kirby ended the day by plunking himself in front of the television to take in a basketball game and an America's Cup yacht race. 

   Other chief executives may feel lost away from the hustle and bustle of corporate life, but not Mr. Kirby, who retired in 1983 after serving nine years as chairman of the electrical equipment and broadcasting concern. 
"I don't miss it," Mr. Kirby says. 
At Westinghouse, he put in 12-hour to 14-hour days -- often followed by business dinners -- and traveled frequently. 
"When you're chairman, you have to do things when others want you to do it," Mr. Kirby recalls. 
"Down here, I set the schedule. 
That, to me, is really great." 

   Mr. Kirby, planning for a life of leisure, bought his home in an exclusive enclave of Naples in 1981. 
"I was really looking forward to being able to relax as much as possible and spend time on things I didn't have time to when I was working," he says. 
That means golf at least four times a week and frequent dips in his outdoor swimming pool and backyard Jacuzzi. 
And each year, to escape Florida's steamy weather, Mr. Kirby and his wife, Barbara, spend summers at their home in Pittsburgh. 

   Of course, it isn't all the life of Riley for Mr. Kirby. 
He stays active as a director of the Professional Golf Association tour, a director of Mellon Bank -- where, he notes, he keeps his money -- and chairman of the University of Pittsburgh's board, among other things. 
Still, he turns down invitations to serve on other boards, and his current obligations require only about 50 meetings a year -- far fewer than he had to squeeze into his hectic schedule before retiring. 

   ---
   "I'd rather wear out than rust out," declares Kemmons Wilson, the founder and former chairman of Memphis, Tenn.-based Holiday Inns Inc. 

   When Mr. Wilson retired in 1979 from the company he started 27 years earlier, it was for all of three weeks -- and that was spent recuperating from a heart attack and open heart surgery. 
Then it was back to work. 
Now 74 years old, Mr. Wilson still puts in 12-hour days at Kemmons Wilson Co., a company that he founded in 1935 and that his three sons run. 

   By the time he left Holiday Inns (currently named Holiday Corp.), Kemmons Wilson already owned or had stakes in 25 businesses, from small hotel chains to cemeteries. 
The entrepreneurial Mr. Wilson has expanded it by adding a nacho corn chip and jalapeno pepper dip company, a time share resort in Florida and a savings and loan association, among others. 
"I would go crazy if I didn't have anything to do," he says. 

   Most of the day-to-day operations are left to other executives or partners, but Mr. Wilson still keeps tabs on things. 
He spends about six hours a day in his office sifting through mail, answering telephone messages and dictating letters. 
Just like his old office at Holiday Inns, his new office has about 100 awards and plaques hanging from the walls and a large portrait of his mother hanging over his desk. 

   The rest of the time, Mr. Wilson visits his nearby businesses to check things out. 
Strolling through his Wilson World hotel and conference center recently, he was constantly interrupted by onlookers wanting to shake his hand. 
Mr. Wilson's family was poor when he was growing up in Memphis, but today he is one of the city's best-known citizens. 
"We call him Mr. Memphis," says Mayor Richard Hackett, who joined Mr. Wilson for soft vanilla ice cream. 

   Several months ago, Mr. Wilson took his first extended vacation since 1951, and even that was just for six days. 
But life isn't all work. 
To relax, he goes hunting with his sons, plays tennis and joins the family's weekly Sunday dinner gatherings. 

   His advice to other retiring chief executives? 
"Get out and get another job as quickly as you can," he says. 
"You can't play golf and make love all day." 

   ---
   Most chief executives retire in their 60s. 
Archie McCardell retired -- unexpectedly -- at 55. 

   When Mr. McCardell became chief executive of International Harvester Co. in 1978 at age 51, there was every reason to think he would be around for a long time. 
But after a lengthy strike and recession led to steep losses at the maker of farm equipment and trucks, Mr. McCardell left under a cloud in May 1982. 
Despite reports that he was ousted, Mr. McCardell says he left on his own accord. 
"I was relieved. 
And I felt no bitterness," he recalls. 

   Still, for a while Mr. McCardell didn't know what to do. 
Lacking any plans, he decided simply to relax and think things over. 
For several months, he didn't do much more than sleep, jog and play golf and tennis. 
He slimmed down, dropping 20 pounds. 
In between the sports, he tended to his personal finances, setting up trusts for his three children. 

   He passed up opportunities to return to corporate life. 
Soon after leaving Harvester (since renamed Navistar International Corp.), for example, Mr. McCardell received offers to become chief executive at several companies. 
"I didn't see anything that turned me on," he recalls. 

   Six months after he retired, Mr. McCardell's daughter, Sandy, and her husband asked him to go into business with them and his other two children. 
"We thought he was our greatest asset," remembers Raul Arcenas, the son-in-law. 
Mr. McCardell accepted the offer, becoming chairman of ARM Properties Inc., a residential real estate concern, and ARM Enterprises Inc., a management firm that advises ailing small businesses. 

   At Harvester, Mr. McCardell put in 13 hours a day, spent evenings with a briefcase full of work and often took aspirin in the morning to relieve headaches. 
"There was no time to do anything other than work," he recalls. 
At ARM, he usually works seven or eight hours a day, most of the time advising family members, who handle day-to-day operations. 
He often takes off four or five days a month, which gives him plenty of time to commute between his ivy-covered mansion in Fairfield, Conn., and homes in Florida, Canada and upstate New York, and to play golf and tennis. 

   Retiring early, Mr. McCardell now says, has worked out to his liking. 
"Don't wait until you're 65," he advises other top executives. 
"Do it while you still have energy. 
The older you get, the less flexible you are." 

   ---
   William Norris vividly remembers his last day as chairman of Control Data Corp. in January 1986. 
"The day I walked out of my office, I felt a little tug in my belly, like when I left the (family) farm in Nebraska to take a job at Westinghouse Electric," he says. 
"It was the realization that an important chapter in my life had ended." 

   But not the last chapter. 
A year after retiring, the 75-year-old Mr. Norris -- who founded Control Data in 1957 -- is still going strong. 
Instead of beginning a second business career like many retired executives, however, Mr. Norris is pursuing his avocation -- preaching about ways that business can help solve America's problems. 

   To spread his gospel, Mr. Norris is giving at least three lectures a month around the U.S. 
His favorite topics: how U.S. computer companies can combat foreign rivals (by sharing technology), how America can create more jobs (by helping people start and grow small businesses) and how education can be improved (by expanding computer-based education). 

   Mr. Norris's proselytizing on these topics resulted in more criticism than praise when he was running Control Data. 
Critics inside and outside the company contended that he was so busy promoting these issues that it distracted Control Data from its main business of selling computers, and resulted in losses in his final two years at the helm; the company has axed many of his pet programs. 
But now, though he remains a director of Control Data and is a consultant to the company, he can say what he wants without causing grumbles. 

   Because he operates out of a Control Data office across the street from the company's headquarters in Bloomington, Minn., much of his daily routine has stayed the same. 
Still, some things are different. 
"He's as busy as ever, but probably a little more relaxed," says Betty Jane, his wife for 43 years, noting that Mr. Norris has more time to swim, fish and go for walks. 
"He talks in his sleep less often than he used to. 
I interpreted that as tenseness when the company was under a lot of pressure."

   The House Budget Committee approved a cutback of nearly $8 billion in military spending next year, indicating general concurrence with a $36 billion deficit-reduction proposal floated by Democratic leaders. 

   With Republicans abstaining, the Democrat-controlled panel voted 13-8 to set military outlays at $282.6 billion in fiscal 1988, which begins Oct. 1. 
While that's a $6 billion increase from this fiscal year's spending, it's a $7.9 billion reduction from the $290.5 billion the Defense Department would have to spend to keep pace with inflation. 

   The vote is a firm rebuke to President Reagan, who requested outlays of $298 billion, and it is close to the $9 billion reduction that House Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) had proposed. 

   Rep. Wright is seeking a deficit-reduction package that would trim $9 billion from projected military spending, $9 billion from nonmilitary outlays and an $18 billion tax increase in fiscal 1988. 

   Rep. Butler Derrick (D., S.C.) declared the decision "very close" to the package that the Democrats have been considering. 
It was supported by both Chairman William Gray (D., Pa.) and House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.). 

   The military spending figure has been the most controversial and pivotal budget issue. 
Conservative Democrats had been resisting so large a cut and, in turn, liberals had resisted trimming social programs until a significant military reduction was agreed to. 

   The most liberal and most conservative members of the budget panel voted against the figure. 
But now that the majority sentiment has been expressed, the way is clear for approval soon of the entire $36 billion deficit-reduction package floated by the Democratic leaders. 

   The budget is a long way from completion, however. 
Both the House and Senate must approve their own versions of a deficit-reduction plan and then reconcile the two. 
The Senate is likely to want a far higher military spending number than the House panel approved yesterday. 

   As illustrated by the split vote in the committee, House approval might also involve a fight. 
Republicans, who were protesting the entire process by refusing to vote yesterday, could gang up with conservative Democrats to create problems for any budget resolution that sharply cuts the military. 

   In addition, the military spending figure voted yesterday was tentative and might be adjusted later should the Democratic leadership devise a substitute plan.

For Comdata Network for $342.7 Million

   First Financial Management Corp. said it offered to buy Comdata Network Inc., a Nashville, Tenn.-based money transfer concern, for cash and stock valued at $18 a share, or $342.7 million. 

   First Financial, noting that Comdata has signed a letter of intent to be acquired by a New York venture capital concern in a $285.6 million transaction, said it wouldn't pursue its proposal if it isn't accepted by Comdata directors. 

   A Comdata spokesman said the company had no immediate comment on the offer. 

   Under terms of the offer, Comdata holders would receive half a share of First Financial common for each Comdata share, provided that the market value of First Financial isn't less than $28 a share, said First Financial, a provider of data processing services and products. 
The cash portion would be determined by the average market price of First Financial shares during the period shortly before completion of the transaction. 
The formula is designed to limit the cash portion to no more than $4 per share, a First Financial spokeswoman said. 

   M. Tarlton Pittard, First Financial's executive vice president and chief financial officer, said the company would give only stock for Comdata if its average market price equals or exceeds $36 a share. 
He said the exchange ratio would remain at half a share for each Comdata share should First Financial's average share price exceed $36. 

   As previously reported, Welsh, Carson, Anderson &amp; Stowe, the New York-based venture capital concern, proposed to buy Comdata for cash or a combination of cash and securities. 
Under that proposal, holders would receive either $15 in cash or $10 and a unit of securities for each of Comdata's approximately 19 million common shares outstanding. 
The proposal was subject to conditions, including Welsh Carson obtaining as much as $200 million in financing. 

   The Welsh Carson proposal supplanted a Comdata recapitalization proposal, under which Comdata would have purchased as many as six million of its common shares for $14.50 each. 

   Comdata shares closed yesterday at $16.375, up $1.625, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Volume was more than one million shares. 
First Financial shares closed at $29.75, down $1.50, in national over-the-counter trading. 

   A group led by Rosewood Financial Inc., a Dallas investment firm, holds 6.2% of Comdata stock and had opposed the recapitalization plan. 
A spokesman for Rosewood didn't return a phone call. 

   First Financial said it made an offer at this time in order to allow the Comdata directors to evaluate its offer and the Welsh Carson proposal. 
"FFMC believes its proposal affords greater value to the Comdata shareholders," the company said. 

   The proposed transaction would be subject to approval of a definitive agreement by the boards of both companies, fairness opinions from the companies' investment bankers and the approval of Comdata holders, First Financial said.

When the Heat Is On:
Close the Door, Hold the Calls, Skip
Rope -- And Other Ways Chiefs Let Off Steam
---
By David J. Jefferson</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   The ringing phones. 
The three-hour board meetings. 
The drop in earnings. 

   It's all part of the stress-filled life of the chief executive officer. 
But how is a frazzled CEO to vent his frustrations at work and still maintain an air of grace under pressure? 

   Some executives share their secrets for letting off steam: 

   Get Hopping
   Quotron Systems Inc. Chairman Milton E. Mohr likes to skip out on his troubles -- literally. 
When tension rises, the 71-year-old executive retires to a small room adjoining his office, where he skips rope. 
His attire? 
"I change into an athletic supporter. 
Period." 

   A half-hour of aerobic activity lets Mr. Mohr get away from the business of running a financial information-services company and allows him a little privacy; he says his secretary hasn't once walked in on him during 25 years of rope-hopping. 

   After the Spartan regimen, which includes several sets of sit-ups and push-ups, Mr. Mohr likes to ease back into the heat of executive battle at Quotron (which was acquired last year by Citicorp) by cooling off reading a newspaper. 

   Take It From Rambo
   "To have a little blow-up now and then is OK," says Peter M. Hoffman, president of Los Angeles-based Carolco Pictures Inc., the movie company that produced the Rambo films. 

   "It puts you on the animal level, as it were," says Mr. Hoffman. 
Unlike most of his peers, the 37-year-old executive, who suffers from a self-described "marginal nervous stomach condition," is quick to admit that he'll yell at someone who pushes him too far. 

   "We try to have an open attitude here so people can go a little nuts or act weird. 
We're in the movie business. 
We're more relaxed." 

   Bring the Mountain to Mohammed 

   Eli Broad describes his passion for art collecting as "an educational and emotional experience." 

   The chairman of Kaufman &amp; Broad Inc., who was also the founding chairman of the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, has a personal art collection of about 200 works and a corporate collection of about 600. 

   So when Mr. Broad, 53, needs to let off a little steam, he simply strolls the halls of the home-building and insurance company to admire the paintings, wall reliefs and posters by Southern California artists. 

   "Although I live with this art," he explains, "if I want to feel good and relaxed, I'll start looking at the paintings . . . and get my mind off the business problem before returning to it." 

   Learn a Lesson From the Past
   When H.J. Heinz Co.'s Anthony O'Reilly needs a break from the problems of the present, he turns to the past. 

   The 50-year-old former rugby player from Dublin says he likes to pick up a history book and read a bit when things get too hectic at the office. 
Currently Mr. O'Reilly is tackling a biography of William Gladstone, the 19th century British prime minister. 

   The chief executive also tells jokes to ease tension in the board room, and history is often the source. 
One of his favorites: During World War II Winston Churchill reported that "the position" in England was serious but not hopeless, "and an Irishman listening said, 'The position in Ireland was always hopeless, but happily never serious.'" 

   Consult Your Beautician
   When running a chain of restaurants from her Beverly Hills, Calif., home gets too hectic for Marilyn Lewis, she pampers herself. 

   "Getting my hair done or having my nails done relaxes me," says the 56-year-old chairman of Hamburger Hamlets Inc. 
A beauty break isn't always the best medicine for the athletic executive, however. 
"You're sitting there on borrowed time, and it emphasizes what you haven't done." 

   Dream On
   Grandma always said to take your nap. 
It's something Armand Hammer hasn't forgotten. 
When the 88-year-old chairman and chief executive of Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp. wants to relieve stress at the office, he catches 40 winks. 
"I have a pillow and a blanket in my closet," says Dr. Hammer. 
"I pull the curtains and I take a nap for 15 or 20 minutes." 

   Hang in There
   Paul Oreffice is rarely more than arm's length from a chinning bar. 

   The 59-year-old head of Midland, Mich.-based Dow Chemical Co. has chinning bars fastened in doorways at his two homes, and in his office closet. 
But he doesn't use the bars for chin-ups: "I just hang." 

   Mr. Oreffice says 30 seconds of hanging by the arms helps relieve the tension that builds up in his neck and back. 
He also likes to extend his legs and strengthen his thigh muscles while sitting at his desk, an isometric exercise he learned from physical therapists who helped him recover from an old football injury. 

   Even during lengthy board meetings, the six-foot, 180-pound executive remains active, tightening and releasing his stomach muscles. 
"The great thing about isometrics is that nobody else knows I'm doing it." 
He says the stress-relieving exercises come in handy "particularly during boring presentations." 

   Look on the Bright Side
   Andy Granatelli says that when he's confronted with a stressful situation at work, he simply tells himself that things aren't nearly as bad as they seem. 

   The 63-year-old former race car driver now owns and operates a chain of automobile service shops across the Southwest called Tuneup Masters. 
The bright side outlook keeps him from getting overheated when he's caught in Los Angeles rush-hour freeway traffic. 

   "I could get upset. 
But I say, 'Look. 
All these motors are running now, and their motor oil and engines are running down. 
They'll need tuneups soon.'" 

   ...And Look Both Ways Before You Cross the Street 

   Martin S. Davis sums up his approach to stress-reduction: patience. 

   "There's stress everywhere. . . . 
You cross the street and it's stressful. 
So you have the patience and you wait for the light to change," says the 59-year-old chairman and chief executive of New York-based Gulf &amp; Western Industries Inc. 

   Mr. Davis says he doesn't let himself get worked up over business problems. 
"Part of the job of managing is managing stress," he says. 
"You learn to have patience, and you can handle anything." 

   Think of the Funniest Things
   "There was a time earlier in my career when I took myself too seriously," says William J. Popejoy, 48. 
"When things went wrong, I was quicker to lash out." 

   Now when the chairman and chief executive of Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. of America finds stress getting the better of him at work, he simply sits back and recalls the more light-hearted moments in his life. 
"A little bit of laughter can relieve stress," he says. 

   Mr. Popejoy was named chairman and chief executive of Financial Corp., holding company for American Savings &amp; Loan Association, the nation's largest thrift, in 1984 after Charles W. Knapp resigned the posts under intense pressure from federal regulators. 
Mr. Popejoy reminisces about the letters that flooded his office after he appeared in a television commercial for the thrift. 
"One letter said, 'You have old-time star-like qualities -- like Rin Tin Tin.'" 

   He says memories of college athletic days are also good for a chuckle. 
Mr. Popejoy remembers one buddy who got "so hyper" before his event at a track-and-field meet that when he went to take off his sweatpants "he took down everything" -- in front of hundreds. 

   Stress? What Stress?
   Why not just face facts and relish the tooth-grinding, blood-pumping states of stressful bliss? 

   "I thrive on it," says Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs, who has used the company he heads, Minstar Inc., to wage takeover battles against such hefty targets as Borg-Warner Corp. and AMF Inc. 
While some people like to avoid stressful situations, the 45-year-old executive says, "I think of it as a way of life." 

   He adds, however, that he and his colleagues "probably create more stress (for others) than we have" ourselves.

RJR Nabisco's Sticht, 69, Who Retired
As Chairman in '83, to Get Post Again

   RJR Nabisco Inc. said it will bring back J. Paul Sticht, former chairman and chief executive officer, as chairman. 

   The appointment was made to provide a stabilizing influence, sources said. 
RJR has been rocked by change since the beginning of the year, when F. Ross Johnson, president, was named chief executive officer. 

   Mr. Sticht, 69 years old, retired as chairman in 1983 and is currently an RJR director and chairman of the executive committee. 
He will succeed as chairman J. Tylee Wilson, 55, who, as previously reported, is taking early retirement. 
The change is expected to take effect after a board vote on April 22, the date of RJR's annual meeting. 

   RJR said Mr. Sticht will be chairman until April 1988, when, under company retirement policies, he will step down at age 70. 

   The company said the appointment of Mr. Sticht, who would focus on the company's external affairs, would free Mr. Johnson to concentrate on running the business. 

   RJR said the appointment was suggested by Mr. Johnson. 
However, the move came as a surprise to those who had considered Mr. Johnson the likely successor to Mr. Wilson. 
Mr. Johnson, 55, had already taken swift control of the company, engineering the controversial impending move of its headquarters to Atlanta, completing the $1.2 billion sale of its liquor business and launching a study of a possible spinoff of RJR's tobacco business into a master limited partnership. 

   But neither analysts nor sources close to the company said they thought Mr. Sticht's appointment was designed to put the brakes on Mr. Johnson -- -or to affect his management of the company. 
"Paul Sticht will be a statesman. 
He won't be active in management," said an executive close to the company. 
"Ross Johnson isn't exactly a stabilizing influence in a new situation. 
Paul Sticht is. 
When the alligators are in the boat, he makes you feel very calm, keeps his hand on the tiller and the boat on course." 

   The appointment of Mr. Sticht, who was first named chairman in 1979, could be a calming influence on RJR's tobacco business, which in the last three months has been shaken both by management changes and by the possibility of the spinoff. 
It could help smooth relations with the Winston-Salem community, which has also been badly shaken by RJR's impending move. 

   The move wasn't seen as a sign of board conflict. 
Mr. Johnson has had the support of the board and of Mr. Sticht, so powerful a director that some say he has been unofficial chairman all along. 

   This isn't the first time Mr. Sticht has been plucked from the board to serve in a larger role. 
In 1973, a year after having retired as president of Federated Department Stores Inc., he was named president and chief operating officer of R.J. Reynolds Industries Inc., where he was already a director. 
That positioned him to subsequently become the first non-tobacco chief executive of the company that became RJR, and he oversaw its first surge of diversification. 

   This time, Mr. Sticht's new duties will include trade, customer and government relations, and he will be chairman of a council of advisers on the company's international affairs. 

   Mr. Johnson was vice chairman and chief executive officer of Nabisco Brands Inc. when it was acquired by R.J. Reynolds for $4.9 billion in 1985. 
He became president and chief operating officer of the merged company. 

   In other changes, RJR named Mr. Johnson chairman of the executive committee, succeeding Mr. Sticht. 
James O. Welch Jr., chairman and chief executive of the company's Nabisco Brands Inc. unit, was named vice chairman of RJR, a title he shares with Edward A. Horrigan, chairman and chief executive of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Robert J. Carbonell, formerly executive vice president of RJR, was named senior executive vice president.

   General Motors Corp. will temporarily idle 3,500 hourly workers Monday when it halts production to adjust inventories on one of two assembly lines at its Lansing, Mich., car assembly plant. 

   The line, which builds the compact Buick Somerset and Skylark and the Oldsmobile Calais, will be down for two weeks, the company said. 
GM said the shutdown is designed to reduce bulging inventories of unsold cars. 

   Dealers had a 146-day supply of unsold Somersets on their lots at the end of February, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade publication. 
That's more than double the 60-day to 65-day supply considered normal. 
Unsold inventories of the Calais model stood at 83 days. 

   Production of the Pontiac version of the cars, the Grand Am, will continue on the second line at the plant. 
That car has been much more popular than its Buick and Olds counterparts, with unsold supplies Feb. 28 at only 51 days. 

   GM said it plans to resume output of Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Firebirds Monday at its Norwood, Ohio, car assembly plant after a one-week closing because of material shortages. 

   U.S. car makers are scheduled to build 169,403 cars this week, up 1.2% from 167,443 cars last week. 
This week's expected output is down 4.6% from the year-earlier production of 177,588. 

   GM's estimated production is up 4.6% from last week's 85,087; Ford Motor Co.'s total will rise 2.6% to 43,938; and Chrysler Corp.'s will fall 13% to 19,400 from last week's 22,383. 
The Chrysler cuts were fairly evenly distributed throughout the company's product line. 

   GM said it scheduled one U.S. car assembly plant and four U.S. truck assembly plants for overtime tomorrow. 
Ford said it scheduled overtime tomorrow at one U.S. car and one truck assembly plant. 
Chrysler said it scheduled two U.S. car assembly plants for overtime Saturday. 
Honda Motors Corp. scheduled eight hours of overtime tomorrow at its Marysville, Ohio, car assembly plant.

Seeks Spinoff, Bar
Against Greenmail

   A group that owns 6.5% of GenCorp Inc.'s stock suggested that the Akron, Ohio-based company spin off all of its non-broadcasting assets to shareholders and refuse to pay greenmail to any raider. 

   The spinoff proposal is the reverse of one that GenCorp's management made several years ago to spin off GenCorp's broadcast properties. 

   The investment group, which includes New York-based Gabelli Group Inc., is one of two groups to make a Securities and Exchange Commission filing this week regarding GenCorp, a tires, plastics, aerospace and broadcasting concern. 
The Gabelli group advocates the spinoff as a way to "materially narrow the spread between the public price of GenCorp's shares and the underlying value." 

   The Gabelli filing was made just prior to a surprise tender offer for GenCorp's shares. 
As previously reported, a group including AFG Industries Inc., an Irvine, Calif.-based glass maker and distributor, and Wagner &amp; Brown, a closely held Midland, Texas-based oil and gas concern, said in an SEC filing Wednesday that they had acquired 9.8% of GenCorp's stock and had launched a $100-a-share tender offer for the remainder. 
However, the $2.2 billion offer is conditioned upon GenCorp withdrawing a "poison pill" anti-takeover defense and Federal Communications Commission approval of a voting trust arrangement for the broadcast properties. 

   The AFG group said it would sell GenCorp's radio and television properties, its soft-drink bottling businesses and the Aerojet General aerospace and defense division. 

   According to the Gabelli SEC filing, the group requests that one of its representatives be elected to the GenCorp board to advance the spinoff proposal. 
The group said it first raised the proposal at a GenCorp meeting with securities analysts last month, but hasn't had a private meeting with GenCorp management to discuss the issue. 

   The Gabelli group proposes that shareholders be precluded from selling shares to the company without prior approval by a shareholder vote. 
The group said that would eliminate a chance of greenmail, "which is repugnant." 
Greenmail refers to a company buying back its shares at a premium from an unwanted suitor. 

   GenCorp has said it is studying the tender offer and urged shareholders to withhold a decision until March 31. 
A GenCorp spokesman said the company is aware of the Gabelli filing, but didn't have an immediate comment. 

   The company for years has been puzzling over what to do with its broadcast properties. 
Several years ago, management considered spinning off its broadcast business to end disputes over licenses, but the FCC didn't accept that remedy. 
Licenses for two of GenCorp's three television stations and all 12 radio stations have been under challenge for two decades. 
Challenger groups allege that GenCorp is an unfit broadcaster because the company failed to adequately inform the FCC of allegedly improper campaign contributions and foreign payments. 

   According to the Gabelli filing, the group's most recent GenCorp stock transactions included purchases of 482,000 common shares Jan. 12 through March 5 at $71 to $87 each and sales of 89,556 shares Jan. 26 through March 17 at $71 to $89.636 each. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, GenCorp shares rose $2.50 to close at $109.

   American Nuclear Corp. said it received a $24 million preliminary contract to remove uranium mill tailings from an abandoned mill site in Riverton, Wyo. 

   The tailings, which are residue from uranium ore in a milling operation, will be moved to American Nuclear's licensed tailings disposal facility in central Wyoming, the company said. 

   The project will be jointly funded by the U.S. Energy Department and the state of Wyoming. 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has amended American Nuclear's license to permit the removal, according to the uranium exploration and development concern. 

   American Nuclear said the contract is subject to, among other things, a final agreement to insure that the relocated tailings will be stabilized in accordance with federal regulatory standards. 
The contract also is expected to provide assurance that the Energy Department won't assume liability for the disposal site or for material in it that isn't from the abandoned Riverton mine.

A Lingering Stigma:
Divorce Might Not Halt the Climb,
But It Still Raises Eyebrows
---
By Cynthia Crossen</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Back when divorce was shameful, corporate America joined the rest of society in labeling men with broken marriages as failures. 
For them, there was no room at the top. 

   Over time, divorce has seeped into every stratum of American life, and now most people assume that it no longer carries a stigma. 
But in America's executive suites, some of the stigma lingers. 

   A superbly qualified man probably wouldn't be denied a top job because of his marital status. 
But a divorce won't go unnoticed. 
To his superiors, it will be a subject of concern and curiosity; they'll want to know how he handled it and how, if he hasn't remarried, he's handling his new status. 
Though divorce is deeply personal, when it happens to a corporate executive, other people make it their business. 

   Among senior executives of major corporations, divorce is still far from common. 
A survey by The Wall Street Journal found that the typical chief executive officer of a Fortune 500-level company is a 58-year-old man married to a woman who doesn't work outside the home. 
And typically, he has been married to the same woman for more than 20 years. 
All 351 of the respondents in the survey were men, and only 3.4% of them were divorced. 
Of those who were married, only 18% had been married more than once. 

   The marital picture for women executives is quite different. 
According to a recent report by Heidrick &amp; Struggles Inc., an executive search firm, more than 40% of female corporate executives are single, separated or divorced. 
Among executives, a man without family is an anomaly, but a woman without family is normal. 

   Age helps explain the low divorce rate among senior corporate men. 
Most are older than 45 and thus belong to generations that have a relatively low incidence of divorce. 
But a debate simmers about why executive men seem to divorce even less than average. 

   Some believe that men who succeed in the business world are a breed apart, able to cope with their personal lives as maturely as they do their business problems. 
"My bias is that the person who becomes a CEO is a remarkable, unusual guy who has risen above many hazards and problems along the way," says Richard Diedrich, manager of the Boston office of Rohrer, Hibler &amp; Replogle, a corporate psychology group. 
"He stands above the group in terms of general psychological health." 

   Others theorize that corporate executives may be so driven by their work that even if their home lives are wretched, they simply can't be bothered to get a divorce. 
"Guys on the fast track go full bore on their jobs and don't have time to get a divorce," says David Peasback, president of Heidrick &amp; Struggles. 
"They're busy, active people who can tolerate what other people might not." 

   A third group wonders whether executive men, like politicians, still feel their careers are more likely to flourish if they paint a pretty picture of their home lives. 
Twenty years ago, the perfect family facade was crucial. 
"We all knew people who weren't happy but stayed married because they didn't want a divorce," says Harding Lawrence, former chief executive of Braniff Airlines, who divorced and remarried in the middle of his career. 

   The topic of divorce still seems to make many senior executives uncomfortable. 
To follow up its recent survey, The Wall Street Journal telephoned more than a dozen chief executives who have been divorced. 
All declined to be interviewed. 
Asked why his boss didn't want to be quoted on the subject, one executive's assistant said, "He feels he is a symbol of this company, and he doesn't want this company associated in people's minds with divorce." 

   Although that pressure may be subtler now, some people argue that it still exists. 
"There's definitely an unspoken pressure to keep a marriage together," says Patricia Cook, principal at Egon Zehnder International, an executive search firm. 
"The pressure says if you want to be CEO, you have to demonstrate that you're not an ordinary man and not subject to the same vulnerabilities as the rest of the population. 
You have to be Mr. Perfect." 

   That's a tall order. 
From the wife's viewpoint, strains are inherent in this kind of marriage. 
As a rule, the amount of time the husband spends with his wife and family is severely limited. 
The husband believes he has to make big sacrifices in his personal and family life to succeed in his career, so he makes them. 
Sometimes the sacrifices become excessive, and the marriage is jeopardized. 

   "My husband usually arrives home exhausted and detached," complains the wife of a Fortune 500 chief executive who has contemplated divorce. 
"Invariably, when a crisis occurs at home, he is hundreds of miles away and preoccupied." 
Another discontented wife says: "We participate in activities to enhance his career. 
I direct my life according to his needs." 

   When a corporation frowns on divorce, it usually has less to do with the industry or region of the country than with the man at the helm. 

   Mr. Diedrich remembers the president of a company looking for a successor and considering four or five logical contenders, one of whom was on the threshold of divorce. 
"The president's attitude was, 'I'm not sure I want to turn my company over to him,'" Mr. Diedrich says. 
"But really he was saying, 'This position calls for interacting socially and politically with the community, and my successor needs an able lady at his side to enable him to do what I've done.' 
The president prided himself on having worked a balance between home and work, and if he could do it, so could other people." 

   Today, however, corporate chiefs have to be careful about expressing their prejudices openly. 
For one thing, in 20 states and the District of Columbia, it's illegal to discriminate in hiring or promotions on the basis of marital status. 
But recruiters trying to place a senior executive at certain companies say they know without being told that candidates must fit in. 

   David Smith, managing director of the New York office of Korn/Ferry International, an executive search firm, tells of a search for a bank president. 
"The client was very specific about almost everything, from religion to marital status. 
It's not so much that they were against one or the other; it was more to fit into the community. 
They told us, 'The person should have a wife, be a family man.'" 

   Even so, the vast majority of recruiters and executives say divorce won't make or break a job candidate anymore. 
Ralph Young, president of Amasco, an executive search firm based in Pittsburgh, says that when he got started in the business in 1964, "We had clients small and large who simply told us they didn't want a divorced man. 
Their feeling was, if a man can't run his home life, he's not capable of running our company." 
Today, he says, tolerance is much more widespread. 
"We always specifically ask that question (about divorced candidates)," he says, "and the response isn't negative at all." 

   That's not to say a man's divorce is irrelevant. 
"It's information I want to pass on to the client," Mr. Smith says. 
"It's information like how tall he is. 
It shouldn't be the deciding factor, but it should help the client know the person." 

   At companies that prefer to promote from within, a man with marriage troubles who is already considered a valued employee is likely to be shown tolerance. 
Charles W. Sweet, vice president and partner of A.T. Kearney Inc., a Chicago-based executive search concern, recalls an officer in a large company who was granted an indefinite leave to work out his marital problems. 
"Ten or 15 years ago," he says, "the company wouldn't have done anything for him." 

   It's unlikely that the choice for top job would ever come down to two candidates identical in every way but marital status. 
But if it did, there's little doubt which one would get it. 
"Like in football, the good big man is better than the good little man," says Mr. Peasback. 
"If you have two identical candidates, you'd probably take the one who isn't divorced." 

   What's more, not all divorces are equal. 
A company considering a divorced man for a top job would also want to know the details. 

   "A recent divorce raises the spectre that at night, instead of going home to his wife and hearth, he's going to go out to discos and stay out late, and his energy won't be devoted to the company," Ms. Cook says. 

   A messy divorce is worse. 
"If there's some kind of scandal attached to it, or if another member of the organization has been dragged in because they're in the same social circles, that will leave a residual distaste," says Harry Levinson, a psychologist and president of the Levinson Institute in Boston. 

   Undesirable as a recent or messy divorce can be, some companies regard men who cheat on their wives as even worse risks. 

   "If a guy's having an affair on the side and spending a lot of time figuring out how to meet the woman, he'll be just as diverted from his work," Ms. Cook says. 
"Also, there's a much greater likelihood that there's going to be a tinge in the company that he's immoral and unethical, and if he's that way in his personal life, maybe he's that way in his business life." 

   But the real pariahs in business, the men who will find no less prejudice today than 20 years ago, are those who have never been married. 

   "It's not a natural thing for people to get past a certain age and not be married," says Bill Billington, chairman of Billington, Fox &amp; Ellis, executive recruitment consultants. 

   Ms. Cook says clients always want to know precisely why a candidate has never married. 
"If it's a male client, the question of gay will be in their minds," she says. 
"And only after a face-to-face meeting can the client put that fear to rest. 
Most heterosexual men have a hard time dealing with gay men, and considering the closeness of the relationship between a chairman and a CEO, it would be tough to have the right chemistry between them if one was gay and one wasn't." 

   (In the recent Wall Street Journal survey of 351 top executives, 66% said they would hesitate to promote someone who is homosexual to management-committee level.) 

   A few companies have overcome such apprehension and have begun recognizing the value of a man unencumbered by family. 
"One of our clients was in the process of recruiting someone for a $1 million-plus job, and we asked about preferences," says Jacques Nordeman, chairman of Nordeman Grimm Inc., an executive search firm. 

   "The client said since the person has to travel 70% of the time, it would be ideal if the candidate were divorced or single, didn't have a family and could concentrate on the job 100% of the time. 
You wouldn't have heard that 10 years ago." 

   Mr. Nordeman says another recent opening for a top financial executive came down to two distinguished candidates, one married with three children and the other recently divorced. 
Although the decision wasn't ultimately made because of marital status, Mr. Nordeman says, the divorced man was hired. 

   "The client knew that the recently divorced person could focus his energies on the new job and there would be no problem getting the family relocated," Mr. Nordeman says. 
In hiring executives, he says, "There could be a real question about whether a person isn't so family-oriented that it could become a hindrance."

   Pay-Fone Systems Inc. said Lewis Greenwood, chairman and president, agreed in principle to sell his 30.2% stake to a company controlled by a dissident director. 

   Mr. Greenwood, the 61-year-old founder of the company, said terms of the sale of his 447,600 Pay-Fone shares to Allied Contractors Inc. call for Mr. Greenwood to resign as chairman, president and a director of the computerized accounting services concern. 
Pay-Fone said successors in Mr. Greenwood's corporate posts and as a director haven't been named. 

   Richard Kelton, 57-year-old president of closely held Allied Contractors, was one of two dissident shareholders elected to Pay-Fone's five-member board last month after a proxy contest. 
Allied Contractors is a Santa Monica, Calif.-based real estate development, construction and management concern. 

   Mr. Kelton said in a statement that he was "gratified" that an agreement was reached with Mr. Greenwood, but a spokesman said he wasn't available for further coment. 
The spokesman said the Pay-Fone board would meet tomorrow to vote on the proposed transaction between Messrs. 
Greenwood and Kelton. 
Their agreement made the transaction subject to approval of shareholders other than Messrs.

   Pier 1 Imports Inc.'s largest holder said it intends to again take majority control of the company's voting stock. 

   Reached at a sales meeting in Bal Harbour, Fla., Clark Johnson, Pier 1's president and chief executive officer, said Intermark Inc.'s proposal is "for the betterment of the stockholders and all of the company." 

   Intermark, which controls 43.4% of Pier 1's common, said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it plans to buy enough additional Pier 1 shares on the open market and in private transactions. 
Intermark and a subsidiary, Pier 1 Holdings Inc., also control about 43% of Pier 1's $0.25 preferred outstanding. 

   Mr. Johnson said that Intermark's SEC filing reflects the companies' agreement to allow Intermark to regain a majority stake it held in the Fort Worth, Texas, specialty retailer for several years until last summer when warrants that diluted Intermark's holdings were exercised. 
Pier 1 recently issued a new class of preferred in a dividend action that was designed to allow Intermark to raise its stake in the company, Mr. Johnson said. 

   Intermark is a La Jolla, Calif., holding company with interests in specialty retailing, commercial printing and consumer products.

Appeals Court Orders Trial
Of Claim Over Buyout;
$150 a Share, or $2,000?

<TEXT>
   A series of lawsuits by former Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. employees have made the credit rating firm the subject of a local tabloid scandal. 

   The lawsuits were filed in federal district court in Chicago by workers who left the employee-owned firm before its shares were acquired in a buyout. 
The suits assert that Duff &amp; Phelps violated various securities laws in its handling of the buyout, which paid $2,000 a share. 
The suits ask that the departing employees, who had to sell their shares at a far lower price when they left the firm, be compensated for the difference. 

   The suits are in the news again because a Chicago federal appeals court this week ordered a jury trial for one of suits, which the lower court had dismissed. 

   The appellate court opinion by circuit Judge Frank H. Easterbrook recounts an embarrassing tale of how Duff &amp; Phelps's former controller, Carol Franchik, was able to swing a different arrangement when she left the company. 

   According to the court opinion, Ms. Franchik was fired after the company's board was told she was involved in an affair with Claire Hansen, Duff &amp; Phelps's chairman. 
When Ms. Franchik threatened a sex-discrimination suit over the firing, the board agreed to make an exception to an existing company policy that departing employees must sell their shares back to the company, said a plaintiff's attorney, James S. Gordon, who cited depositions by board members. 

   Ms. Franchik kept her 300 shares and later sold them for the full buyout price of $2,000 apiece, or a total of $600,000. 
The former employees who are suing sold their shares for less than $150 each. 

   Mr. Gordon, the attorney for plaintiff Paul Much, asserted in his opening argument that Ms. Franchik had access to inside information because of her alleged affair with Mr. Hansen. 
In testimony, Ms. Franchik acknowledged a personal relationship with her former boss. 
Mr. Hansen testified that he told directors he wasn't having an affair. 

   Mr. Hansen declined to comment on the suits. 
Ms. Franchik couldn't be reached. 

   The suits have drawn considerable attention in the Chicago business community. 
Ms. Franchik has appeared on the front pages of local newspapers wearing a fur coat with a turned up collar as she exited the courtroom. 
The publicity could build further with the appellate court's decision. 

   The appeals court sent the suit of James S. Jordan, a former Duff &amp; Phelps analyst, back to the lower court for trial, saying that as a shareholder in a private company Mr. Jordan should have been privy to information Ms. Franchik apparently had. 
The lower court had said in granting summary judgment that the employer had no duty to inform Jordan about the buyout talks. 
There have been no court decisions on the other employee suits. 

   According to the appellate court opinion, Mr. Jordan quit the Chicago-based company in November 1983 and went to Houston because of tension between his wife and his mother, who also lived in Chicago. 
"Our position is that Mr. Jordan would've never left when he did had he been told about the negotiations and the chance that he could've made more than $600,000 instead of $23,000," said Thomas Ward, his lawyer. 

   When Mr. Jordan left Duff &amp; Phelps, he owned 188 shares and was making installment payments on another 62. 
The appeals court apparently agreed with Mr. Ward and Mr. Jordan. 
"Difficulties with a mother-in-law are a strain, but families bear strains greater than that for the prospect of financial gain," wrote Judge Easterbrook.

   Iomega Corp., citing lower-than-anticipated revenue, said it expects to report a first-quarter loss of more than $10 million. 

   The maker of data-storage devices for personal computers said also it has reduced its revenue expectations for 1987 and anticipates a loss for all of 1987. 
The company didn't provide revenue projections or specific figures on the expected loss. 

   Iomega's loss in its first quarter, which ends March 29, will put the company in default under the requirements of its bank line of credit, unless the requirements are modified. 
The company said it is "exploring alternatives" for raising additional funds through a debt or equity financing. 

   An Iomega official said sales of an older-model disk drive have tapered off as customers await the newer model. 
The company expects to return to profitability by the fourth quarter, he said. 

   In 1986, Iomega had net income of $6.4 million, or 42 cents a share, on sales of $125.9 million. 
Net included a $1.3 million tax benefit. 
The company recently announced it will receive a qualified opinion from its auditor because of litigation it faces. 

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Iomega shares closed at $3.125, down $1.125.

At Giving Up Any
Of Texaco Award

Company Moves to Reinstate
$2 Billion Cut by Court
From $11.1 Billion Total

   Is $9.1 billion enough for Pennzoil Co.? 

   Last month, a Texas appeals court panel affirmed $9.1 billion of Pennzoil's $11.1 billion judgment against Texaco Inc. 
The court's only modification in the whopping award came in its reduction of punitive damages to $1 billion from $3 billion. 
The ruling was widely viewed as favorable to Pennzoil and the company at the time expressed "delight" and "gratitude" at the fact that the court upheld the overwhelming part of the award. 

   In a recent filing in the appeals court, however, Pennzoil asked the court to reinstate the full $3 billion in punitive damages. 
Pennzoil said its request was in part a formality that would preserve its right to the full award when Texaco appeals the judgment to the Texas Supreme Court. 
But Pennzoil also stated that it thinks it has a right to every penny of the original award it won when a jury found that Texaco unlawfully interfered with Pennzoil's merger agreement with Getty Oil Co. when Texaco acquired Getty in 1984. 

   "I'm not in the habit of giving away $2 billion," said Joe Jamail, Pennzoil's chief counsel; "$2 billion here, $2 billion thereafter a while it begins to add up." 

   Mr. Jamail said that even when the reduction of $2 billion in damages is taken into account, the judgment now totals $10.3 billion when the accrued interest is included. 

   But Texaco contends that by seeking to have the $2 billion reinstated, Pennzoil had signaled its refusal to comply with the appeals court ruling. 
And as a result of what it calls Pennzoil's "conditional compliance," Texaco has moved that the entire case should be retried in a lower court. 
"Some states say you can't have your cake and eat it too," said Russell McMains, a Texaco attorney who specializes in appellate procedures. 

   Texaco acknowledged that it was attacking on a highly technical point that isn't clearly settled in Texas law. 
But the latest skirmish clearly indicates the intensity of the dispute between the two companies, with Pennzoil scrambling for every cent it can get, and Texaco pursuing every legal remedy it can muster. 

   "We will plow every field," said Mr. McMains. 

   Lawyers not directly involved in the case also said that Texaco appeared to be taking a chance on a long shot. 
"It sounds to me like the 'grasp at any straw' approach to the situation, which is where Texaco is at this point in the case," said Frank W. Morgan, a lawyer here who formerly was associate general counsel for Gulf Corp., now a Chevron Corp. unit. 
"It sounds highly technical." 

   Texaco's latest legal attack is based upon the language buried on page 161 in the appellate panel's opinion. 
The court conditioned the denial of Texaco's motion for new trial upon Pennzoil's agreement to voluntarily drop $2 billion in punitive damages from the judgment. 
Pennzoil at that point indicated it would readily comply with the appellate court ruling. 

   Pennzoil later filed a document called a remittitur in which it agreed to drop $2 billion -- but it also made known its reservations. 
In the document, Pennzoil said it reserved the right to seek a rehearing on the reduction in damages. 
Subsequently, Pennzoil filed a motion for rehearing of the punitive damages issue, contending that the court had "erroneously applied the Texas law, and inappropriately embraced" certain principles of New York law, which was also used in the case. 

   Pennzoil's Mr. Jamail contended that Texaco's latest move to have the judgment overturned was a sign of the company's desperation. 
"If they had a good case, they wouldn't have to reach this deep into the barrel," said Mr. Jamail. 
"It's ludicrous." 

   Texaco acknowledged that its latest legal attack was out of the ordinary, but said that wasn't surprising considering the high stakes involved in the case. 
"Since there's never been a judgment of this size before, I suspect that anything is unusual," said Mr. McMains.

<HL> House Panel Backs Anti-Dumping Move,
Help for Workers Displaced by Imports

   The House Ways and Means Committee, continuing work on trade legislation, approved provisions to enhance benefits to workers displaced by imports and to provide new sanctions for U.S. firms against dumped or subsidized imports. 

   But the panel put off until next week consideration of more controversial proposals that would require retaliation against certain unfair trade practices by foreign countries and limit presidential discretion in resolving trade disputes. 

   And Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) said he was considering waiting until the legislation moves to the House floor before fighting for his highly charged amendment to force trade retaliation against countries that have huge trade surpluses with the U.S. 

   The committee worked all day yesterday behind closed doors on a bill offered by its chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.). 
Rep. Rostenkowski's proposal, which was approved by a Ways and Means subcommittee last week, is viewed as less protectionist than the legislation introduced earlier this year. 

   One provision approved by the committee yesterday would increase retraining benefits for workers whose jobs are lost because of imports. 
It also would set up a voucher system for payment of these benefits. 

   The committee toughened provisions for dealing with foreign companies that repeatedly "dump" goods -- or sell them at unfairly low prices -- in the U.S. 
It provided for expedited action on dumping complaints against foreign companies and took steps to make it easier for U.S. companies to bring civil suits against foreign manufacturers. 
The panel voted to drop a proposal to establish criminal penalties for dumping violations, however. 

   The panel also voted to give the Commerce Department new powers to prevent firms from circumventing anti-dumping orders by shipping their products in parts or through a third country. 

   The committee voted to transfer the authority to determine whether an industry is entitled to protection from imports to the U.S. trade representative from the president. 
Some lawmakers believe that the trade representative would be more inclined than the president to rule that an industry is being hurt by imports. 
Such an injury finding can trigger the imposition of tariffs or quotas on the imports. 

   Under the panel's bill, an import-battered industry would be required to devise a plan to return to competitiveness before it could receive such import relief. 
But even dying industries could qualify. 
The Reagan administration has argued that an industry should be required to demonstrate that it can survive before it can receive such protection. 

   Rep. Gephardt, a presidential candidate, told reporters yesterday that he was determined to push for his amendment, which is designed to force such countries as Japan to reduce their large trade surpluses with the U.S. Rep. Rostenkowski's proposed bill significantly watered down the proposal. 
It simply would require the administration to negotiate with the other country, rather than forcing the president to retaliate immediately. 

   "My concern with that approach is that it doesn't give a standard of accountability," Rep. Gephardt said. 
"I still think I can pass this amendment on the House floor." 

   Meanwhile, a House banking subcommittee approved legislation forbidding foreign firms from becoming primary dealers in U.S. government securities unless their governments give U.S. companies the same right in their countries.

   Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, wants to tighten the rule that investors disclose stock holdings of 5% or more and to lengthen the tender offer period. 

   The proposals will be part of legislation the Michigan Democrat plans to introduce in the wake of Wall Street's insider-trading scandal. 
Speaking at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce yesterday, Rep. Dingell said he will soon introduce separate bills addressing insider-trading problems and the general issue of mergers and acquisitions. 
Similar legislation is being drafted in the Senate. 

   "Clearly the amount of stock that triggers disclosure is far too high," Rep. Dingell said. 
He didn't specify the threshold that will be in his legislative package. 
Currently, an investor is required to report holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission after acquiring 5% or more of a company's stock. 

   The powerful committee chairman also plans to include a provision to extend the tender offer period from the current 20 business days, but he didn't specify how long a period he would seek. 
"My intention is to increase the time a company has to defend itself," he said. 

   Rep. Dingell expressed concern about the "Chinese walls" that are supposed to separate investment banking firms' risk-arbitrage and mergers-and-acquisitions departments. 
"One of the things we'll look at is to see that the Chinese wall works or those on either side will go their separate ways," he said. 

   But Dingell aides said the lawmaker probably wouldn't consider legislation on the matter until his committee's oversight panel completes its probe of insider-trading abuses, including apparent cracks in the "Chinese walls" of some investment banking firms. 

   Rep. Dingell reiterated his intention to shorten the period before investors must disclose to the SEC stakes of 5% or more. 
The current 10-day period often allows raiders to make sneak attacks, and it allows unfounded rumors about hostile bids to build. 
SEC Chairman John Shad also has said he favors shortening the 10-day period. 

   On separate legislation directed at insider trading rather than acquisitions generally, Rep. Dingell said his goal is "to require more careful and attentive supervision" of employees at securities firms. 
And he said he supported giving the SEC greater resources.

   Three banks in Texas and Montana were closed, bringing the number of bank failures this year to 47, more than twice the number at the same time last year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said. 

   The banks -- Red River National Bank in Clarksville, Clarksville, Texas; Sweeney Bank, Sweeney, Texas; and Clarks Fork National Bank, Fromberg, Mont. -- will reopen today as parts of other institutions. 

   The two offices of Red River National, closed by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, are to reopen as branches of State Bank of DeKalb, DeKalb, Texas. 
The failed bank had assets of $22.6 million and held $22.5 million in 4,700 deposit accounts. 

   Sweeney, closed by state banking officials, is to become a branch of First State Bank of Louise, Louise, Texas. 
Sweeney had assets of $17.7 million and held deposits of $17.6 million in 4,800 accounts. 

   Seventeen banks have closed in Texas so far this year. 

   Clarks Fork National, also closed by the Comptroller, was bought by Yellowstone Bank, Laurel, Mont. 
Customers of Clarks Fork National will automatically become customers of Yellowstone and will be able to conduct business at the failed bank's office briefly. 
But that office will eventually close because Montana law doesn't allow banks to operate branches. 

   Clarks Fork National had assets of $8.2 million and held deposits of $7.8 million in 1,500 accounts. 
It was the first Montana bank to fail this year.

Living on $400,000:
Four Chief Executives Give a Peek
At How They Spend What They Reap
---
By John R. Emshwiller

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Chief executives routinely deal with millions of dollars of other people's money. 
But how do they deal with their own? 

   A glimpse of how top executives handle their personal pocketbooks is offered in interviews with the heads of four companies: James A. Cook of Porsche Cars North America Inc., John P. Imlay Jr. of Management Science America Inc., Joel B. Leff of Forstmann Leff Associates Inc. and John C. Merritt of Van Kampen Merritt Inc. 

   These men earn salaries of $200,000 to $400,000 a year, exclusive of any bonuses. 
As a condition of discussing their personal finances, however, they asked that details of their earnings and their spending habits be kept confidential. 

   There are striking similarities in the way these executives run their financial lives. 
One is an aversion to plastic. 
All maintained that, even before they became successful and wealthy, they paid cash for purchases, or else paid credit-card balances in full each month to avoid interest. 

   Each also has an accountant and some have other financial advisers, but none uses a financial planner. 
Most said that they had made it a habit to save regularly, even before a fat paycheck made saving a relatively easy task. 

   "I'm much more professional about what I do for Porsche than about what I do for myself," says Mr. Cook, CEO of Porsche Cars North America in Reno, Nev. 

   His company is 100%-owned by Porsche AG, the European car maker, which in turn is largely family owned. 
So Mr. Cook, 59 years old, holds no stock in his own employer. 
He does own other securities ranging from speculative penny stocks to more middle-of-the-road equities. 

   But he prefers to invest mainly in "things that I don't need to look at every day." 
Buying individual stocks makes him nervous because "if I go to Europe for two weeks, things can happen." 

   In the past, he has favored real estate, mainly as a partner in apartment and hotel ventures. 
In light of the new tax law's harsher treatment of most real estate investments, he says, "I'll be phasing that out." 
He expects to increase his holdings of mutual funds and to maintain, but perhaps scale back, his sizable portfolio of municipal bonds. 

   Mr. Cook and his wife (both of whom were previously married) have seven children. 
When the kids reached driving age and wanted cars, Mr. Cook at first insisted that they should pay half the cost of a car. 
The result was that the cars purchased were "junkers." 

   Later on, Mr. Cook says, he relented and decided to buy his children "decent cars." (The autos aren't Porsches, however.) 
He still requires the children to pay for their own gasoline and insurance. 
"Some people would say, 'Gee, you can afford to do that for your kids.' 
Well, I guess we could. 
But this is one way to teach them responsibility." 

   For financial advice, Mr. Cook turns to the accountant who has served him for many years, and who is soon to become a lawyer as well. 
That takes some doing, since the accountant is in Houston (where Mr. Cook used to live) and Mr. Cook is in Reno. 
"We started out together," Mr. Cook explains, "and he's done a good job." 

   John Imlay is chief executive of Management Science America, an Atlanta-based software and data-processing firm he took public in 1981. 
Most of his net worth consists of stock in his own company, but he has other investments. 

   An array of tax-free bonds is the core of this portfolio. 
Then there's timberland and farmland, mostly in Georgia. 
"I go walk the land" before buying, Mr. Imlay says. 
"I don't care how excited (the sales people) are. 
When you sink into it up to your knees, you know how good it is." 

   Mr. Imlay, 50, also owns stock in other companies. 
"I invest in people," he says. 
Many of his stocks were chosen because he was impressed with a company's executives during business dealings. 

   Ever since he made $300 a month as an office-form sales trainee fresh out of school, Mr. Imlay says, he has followed the "sage advice" of his father and invested 10% of his gross income. 
His capsule version of his dad's advice: "Put down the alligator shoes and invest the money." 

   Like his father, he pays cash for most purchases. 
He disdains credit cards but uses a debit card occasionally. 

   In addition to a checking account and a cash management account with a brokerage firm, he still has a passbook savings account. 
Asked why, he says he's never gotten around to closing it. 
"It's so small it didn't make any difference." 

   Mr. Imlay used to use a financial planner, but decided he didn't need one since "I was making the decisions anyway." 
He relies on his own tax adviser, who is also the company's secretary-treasurer. 

   Joel Leff is co-chairman of the New York-based money-management firm, Forstmann Leff Associates, a subsidiary of Guinness Peat Group PLC. 
He likes to tell the story about a Wellesley College 20-year reunion. 

   One woman, the story goes, showed up in a provocative red dress, high heels and cigarette holder. 
Picking up clues to a disreputable vocation, her classmates asked her what had happened. 
"It was either that," said the woman, "or dip into capital." 

   Mr. Leff, 51, professes a strong dislike for dipping into capital, and says he has done it only once, during the horrendous market of 1974. 
Recently married for the third time, he says he found it somewhat easier to control household expenditures during the years when he was on his own. 
He and his wife take turns paying the bills. 

   A "very conservative" investor, Mr. Leff says he keeps much of his money in municipal bonds rated double-A or higher. 
A smaller amount is in stocks, he says, because "I just don't do it as well for myself as I have for clients. 
I get too emotionally involved." 

   He says his favorite investment has always been real estate, mainly commercial buildings, often with a historical-renovation aspect (and tax advantage) to the deal. 
Despite the new tax law, he expects to keep investing in real estate, but will demand a higher anticipated rate of return before entering any deal. 

   He also invests in art, antique furniture, and gold coins. 
Gold, he says, is "traditional and feels nice. 
It weighs more than 100 shares of IBM." 

   For financial advice and record keeping, Mr. Leff says he has "enough henchmen," including an accountant, a tax attorney, and a full-time personal bookkeeper. 

   As CEO of Van Kampen Merritt, the Lyle, Ill.-based investment banking subsidiary of Xerox Corp. and a leading packager of municipal bond unit trusts, Jack Merritt hardly needs an allowance. 
When he was a youth, however, his father kept him on a strict one. 

   "In my senior year of high school, my father put me on an annual salary and made me get my own checking account," the 46-year-old Mr. Merritt says. 
That arrangement continued into college. 
"I had to go out and work. 
I ran a laundry business and raked leaves," he recalls. 

   He's making similar demands of his own children. 
"It's very important to learn to live within your means." 

   To manage his money these days, Mr. Merritt, who is based in Philadelphia, gets some help. 
He uses several brokers, and likes to "give them some discretion." 
He prefers bonds to stocks, avoids commodities, and likes real estate. 
He is, not surprisingly, partial to mutual funds and unit investment trusts. 
"If you're running a firm, I don't feel you have time to mastermind your investments," he says. 

   In addition to several checking accounts and a money market fund, he still keeps an old-fashioned savings account. 
The reason? 
"To be fair to the bank," Mr. Merritt says. 
In exchange for good banking service, he feels it's only reasonable to allow the bank a dollop of low-cost funds. 

   "I believe generally in working with one major supplier," he says. 
"They're entitled to get some compensation back for their service, provided they're offering good service."

<HL> Mellon Bank Will Cut
Staff to Lower Costs
And Lift Productivity</HL>

   Mellon Bank Corp., the nation's 12th largest banking concern, said it will reduce its work force in an effort to cut costs and boost productivity. 

   The bank holding company declined to estimate the extent of the staff cuts. 
It said in a prepared statement that the cuts are a result of an ongoing internal study of the concern and its staffing levels. 
Mellon said the review will be completed "over the next several weeks." 

   The company has been troubled by a growing number of nonperforming foreign and energy loans. 
In addition, its expenses have grown at a faster pace than those of banks of comparable size. 
In 1986, Mellon's earnings fell 9.1% to $183.3 million, or $6.20 a share, from $201.7 million, or $7.13 a share, in 1985. 

   At the end of 1986, Mellon had 18,419 employees, with 8,800 in its corporate headquarters in Pittsburgh. 
Mellon took a fourth-quarter charge of $9 million to restructure its foreign lending operation, including closing several offices and laying off or transferring workers. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Mellon closed at $55.375 a share, down 50 cents.

The Frill Is Gone:
For the Modern-Day CEO, the Maxim
For Office Design Is: Keep It Spare
---
By Meg Cox</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   The "power" office is out. 
For the lean, mean '80s, a chief executive officer can still have good furniture and some appreciating art on the walls, but the bottom line is function. 

   How times have changed. 
In the early '50s, when Elliott White Springs built a headquarters for his textile company in Fort Mill, S.C., he wanted it to be the most modern building in the world, and his office was a high-tech wonder. 
With a touch of a button, the chief executive of Springs Industries Inc. could elevate a portion of the walnut parquet floor until it became a conference table. 
Other buttons on his desk opened and closed the 120 feet of draperies; turned on the television, radio or movie projector; activated the security system; operated the lights; and vibrated Mr. Springs's chair. 

   Springs's current chief executive, Walter Y. Elisha, prefers a different office, about half the size and without gadgetry. 
His reasons for occupying more modest quarters have little to do with the fact that his company is now public, as opposed to Mr. Springs's era. 
"I find the less elaborate, more functional office better suited to my style," Mr. Elisha says. 

   Mr. Elisha's inclinations reflect a general trend in recent years away from lavish, grandiose offices for chief executives. 

   "Chief executives consider what they do in their offices rather than just the looks of them. 
They want to make it clear they are working executives, not just figureheads," says William Drake, a partner at the architectural firm Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill in Chicago. 
"There used to be much more ceremony involved in entering the CEO's office. 
You walked 20 feet to the grand, old man, behind this huge mahogany desk empty of papers. 
That's a thing of the past." 

   Top executives don't want to blend completely into the paneling: they still prefer large, corner offices and such traditional trappings as private bathrooms. 
But, in general, they don't want to seem either intimidating or overly opulent. 
Communication (with employees) and accountability (to shareholders) are the buzzwords. 
In these takeover times, a too-lavish office just might signal a bloodthirsty raider that there's a profitable opportunity to trim corporate fat. 

   "Some clients do want a palace. 
But heads of public companies mostly tell us they don't want the office so nice that people walk in and think, 'Aha! 
This is where all the money is going,'" says Karen Myers, president of Interior Design Development in Costa Mesa, Calif. 
The new headquarters of American Express Co. in New York's World Financial Center is quite grand, and Chairman James D. Robinson III's paneled office boasts an inlaid marble table, antiques and an Oriental rug. 
But decorator Robert Metzger remembers Mr. Robinson saying over and over, "This item costs too much. 
Find something else." 

   Indeed, big offices may be one factor that spurred raider T. Boone Pickens Jr.'s move against Diamond Shamrock Corp. Former Chief Executive William H. Bricker enjoyed lavish perks that included several corporate jets. 
His office in the company's Dallas headquarters is said to be enormous. 
A Diamond Shamrock spokesman says, "The offices are quite comfortable but there are no extraordinary appointments or architectural features." 

   As for Mr. Pickens's own office at Mesa Limited Partnership in Amarillo, Texas, "We practice what we preach," he says. 
"I have a good, workable, functional desk and a computer. 
There are three western paintings on the wall, but two of them are for sale because they've appreciated in value. 
My office is about 20 feet by 18 feet, and I've had the same office on the fifth floor of a 10-story building for 20 years." 

   There are plenty of other leaders setting a no-frills example: The Silicon Valley aesthetic remains spare. 
Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel Corp. in 1968 and currently its chief executive, still occupies a standard issue, metal and plastic desk in a cubicle whose walls are no higher than anyone else's. 
He has a special chair, a spokesman says, "but that's because he has a bad back." 

   In New York's financial community, where lavish offices are the standard, John Gutfruend of Salomon Brothers Inc. spends much of his workday at a semicircular wooden desk on the trading floor. 
Nearby is a large, private office to which he retreats for meetings. 

   Martin S. Davis, the chairman of Gulf &amp; Western Inc., says, "Everything in my office has got a purpose. 
There are enough chairs for people to meet in and enough tables to work on. 
Most of the furniture, including my antique desk, is my own and I've had it for years. 
It's a workspace: that's what I'm about. 
It's not an entertainment hall." 

   Some executives who inherited large, imposing offices from an earlier era have taken great pains to make them cosier. 
John J. Creedon, president and chief executive of Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., moved into a 22-foot by 34-foot office of 13-foot high walnut paneling four years ago. 
"It's a lot more than I need, and if I were to build one it wouldn't be this big," Mr. Creedon says. 

   Rather than greet visitors from behind his huge desk, Mr. Creedon prefers to sit in an armchair near a large, comfortable couch. 
Seated nearby is one of his two plush, business-suit-clad Snoopy dolls. (Snoopy appears in commercials for the insurance company.) 
"When I'm sitting behind my desk, it might intimidate people," Mr. Creedon says. 
"Here, we can sit with Snoopy, get comfortable, and maybe people will relax." 

   G. Robert Truex Jr., chairman of Rainier Bancorp. in Seattle, describes his office as "traditional, handsome and over-large, which makes me uneasy. 
I'm not a high-powered guy and I don't pretend I am." 

   Mr. Truex encourages people to relax from the moment they arrive at his door, walking across a "Beware of Owner" doormat. 
Inside his office, visitors find an array of music boxes and a vast collection of wind-up toys on the bookcases and credenza. 
Peeping out between the leaves of a potted palm is a plush gorilla in a red T-shirt and a paper crown. 
"I've been known to say that he makes the big decisions around here," says Mr. Truex, who hastens to add: "Please don't get the impression that because I have these toys that I come to work in a clown hat. 
We conduct business here." 

   For all the plush menagerie, tradition nonetheless remains one of the bywords in executive offices, both in furnishings and decorative mementoes, which are meant to convey a sense of stability and longevity. 
Donald Frey, chairman of Bell &amp; Howell Co. of Chicago, moved his company to a modern building in 1985, but in his office he sits at the rolltop desk once used by the company's founder, Albert S. Howell. 
His telephone is Mr. Howell's 1919 brass candlestick phone, which has been electronically refurbished. 

   "In the last three years or so, there has been a return to more conservative environments," says Beverly Russell, editor of Interiors magazine. 
"Inside many ultramodern skyscrapers rising 50 floors, the chairman's office looks like Monticello." 

   Indeed, the look of paneled walls, Oriental rugs and antique wood desks has become so prevalent that some chairmen have rebelled in an effort to stand out, and to send a message of distinctiveness. 

   "We have a new and creative company but we also want to convey solidity, because we guarantee billions of dollars of debt," says Gerald Friedman, chairman and founder of FGIC Corp., which insures municipal bonds. 
FGIC's offices aren't quite like anything else in Manhattan's financial district: sleek and modern, with black marble tables, black lacquer desks and decorative curtain-like cascades of white silk strings from floor to ceiling. 

   Not surprisingly, there are still executives who love their perks and power offices. 
George Wackenhut of Wackenhut Corp. in Coral Gables, Fla., a big firm in the security guard field, isn't the only chief executive with a barber chair in his private bathroom, so his barber can come to him. 
In Houston, a city of impressive offices, it's hard to forget that of J. Hugh Liedtke, chairman of Pennzoil Co., who sits at the head of a 16-foot long desk made of planks from a shipwreck. 
Behind the desk in a large display case is his rock collection, including geodes the size of basketballs. 

   In the name of intimidation, who could better the tactic of a chief executive who asked one design firm to install very bright, adjustable lights above the chairs across from his desk? 
The designer, who won't divulge his client's name, says: "The CEO could really make a guy sweat."

<HL> Hard-Driving Boyd Jefferies's Downfall
Sullies the Innovative Firm He Founded

   Boyd L. Jefferies helped change the rules of the securities game. 
But by breaking them, he has damaged the reputation of what is probably the most innovative and aggressive stock-trading firm outside of Wall Street. 

   The question now is how deep and lasting the damage will be. 

   Jefferies Group Inc., the 445-employee brokerage holding company of which Mr. Jefferies was chairman and chief executive officer, was stunned by his early morning announcement that he planned to plead guilty to two felony counts of violating federal securities laws and that he was resigning. 
After Mr. Jefferies's personal announcement to those employees over a national telephone hookup following its normal 4:50 a.m. PST planning meeting, the brokerage firm locked the elevators at its Los Angeles headquarters for a time. 

   Within hours, the company's new chief executive, Frank Baxter, was taking calls, forcefully arguing that Jefferies would survive and prosper. 
"They call this Jefferies Group for a reason," said Mr. Baxter, a 13-year veteran with the company. 
"We have 190 professionals with personal client relationships." 
The chairman's post remained vacant. 

   Despite yesterday's travails, he added, "it was a good day businesswise. 
Our clients really came through for us." 

   Jefferies is by far the biggest trader in the so-called "third market," in which listed stocks are traded without going through an exchange. 
Such trading has grown rapidly with the bull market, and as big shareholders looked for fast and discreet ways to profit from the increasingly volatile world securities market. 

   Jefferies, a company Mr. Jefferies founded 25 years ago, in 1986 accounted for about 3% of the composite volume of all securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Last January, the company traded about 2% of the Big Board composite trading volume, or 164 million shares, for clients that have ranged from pension funds and individual shareholders to major Wall Street arbitragers. 
Jefferies makes up about 60% of the entire third market. 

   Mr. Baxter, 50 years old, who has been president and chief operating officer of Jefferies, said the January percentage was lower than last year only because the exchanges did extraordinarily heavy volume during the month. 

   Mr. Jefferies, 56, publicly denied that he had engaged in insider trading when he was subpoenaed last year in the government's broad investigation of the securities business. 
Part of a clubby network of major players in the stock market, however, he succumbed to the temptation to swap illegal favors with some clients, including arbitrager Ivan Boesky. 
"Boyd has always wanted to accommodate clients," said Mr. Baxter. 

   Mr. Jefferies declined to be interviewed. 
In a statement, he said: "Something went wrong in our value systems and it is vital that we all learn from my mistakes and those of others." 

   Mr. Jefferies has been a spirited trader who seemed more at home on his company's trading desks than its executive offices. 
His workday started as early as 3 a.m., and often ended late -- though Mr. Baxter said trades attributable to Mr. Jefferies have accounted for less than 5% of the company's volume in recent years. 

   Mr. Jefferies had a large following among takeover investors, who relied on him to assemble large blocks of stock during corporate battles. 
Raiders liked trading with Mr. Jefferies because he moved unusually quickly and secretly and had a big network of contacts among arbitragers and other speculators in takeover stocks. 

   "You felt like Jefferies's trades had to go through less layers of people," said Harold Simmons, a Dallas financier who often traded through Mr. Jefferies. 
"He could move without disturbing a lot of people, and the fewer people who know about these things the better." 

   Like many people, Mr. Simmons described Mr. Jefferies as a driven, intense worker. 
"He was always at his desk. 
You could always reach him; he worked very long hours," Mr. Simmons said. 
He recalled that Mr. Jefferies tracked him down in the middle of a tennis game to try to negotiate the sale of a large block of NL Industries Inc. stock last summer, when Mr. Simmons was seeking control of NL. Mrs. Simmons staved Mr. Jefferies off until her husband finished his game. 

   Some people think Mr. Jefferies's suspension will be a blow to the firm. 
Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. in New York, estimated that more than one-third of the firm's business is directly attributable to Mr. Jefferies's contacts with wealthy investors and institutions. 

   Mr. Long, a longtime acquaintance of Mr. Jefferies, described the trader as exceptionally intense. 
"Some people are compulsive drinkers or compulsive woman-chasers. 
Boyd was a compulsive trader," he said. 
"Whenever I sat with him at his offices -- which had glass windows so he could look out at the trading room -- you could sense he'd like the conversation to end as quickly as possible so he could get back onto the trading desk." 

   In the 1960s, there were many dealers in the third market, where trades were often made for lower commissions than exchange members charged. 
When commissions were later deregulated, many firms dropped out of the business. 

   "They were survivors," one Los Angeles broker said yesterday of the Jefferies firm. 
Mr. Jefferies actually sold the company in 1969 to Investors Diversified Services Inc., now a unit of American Express Co., for $44.2 million. 
But he bought it back four years later -- for less than half that price, according to associates -- and then took the company public in 1983. 

   Over the past decade, two important trends expanded Jefferies's business: the growing internationalization of markets and the rise of the takeover business. 
Suddenly, a firm that could make difficult block trades efficiently at unusual hours was in an enviable position. 

   Mr. Jefferies "gained a world-wide institutional following," said Gordon Macklin, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which regulates the over-the-counter industry, of which Jefferies was a part. 

   Mr. Jefferies became celebrated for virtuoso trading feats. 
In December 1982, during a sudden halt in Big Board trading in Warner Communications Inc., Jefferies &amp; Co., Jefferies Group's brokerage unit, made an almost exclusive market in Warner shares for about a day. 
Working round the clock with traders in Australia, Hong Kong, Kuwait, Switzerland and other places, the firm traded 3.5 million shares in two days. 
The message wasn't lost on the Big Board, which soon opened a vigorous public-relations campaign against off-board trading, and Jefferies in particular. 

   More recently there has been speculation that Jefferies might again be sold. 
American Can Co. began acquiring Jefferies stock in 1985, and it currently has the equivalent of a 20% stake in the firm. 
Yesterday, an American Can spokesman described his company's holding as a "passive investment." 

   Mr. Jefferies controls about 13% of the company, but his interest will be placed in a voting trust for at least the next five years, during which Mr. Jefferies will be barred from the securities business under a consent agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

   "I'd be incredibly surprised if he isn't back in the business someday," said Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs, a friend and business associate of Mr. Jefferies. 
From what he had heard about the violations, they seemed "more technical than criminal," Mr. Jacobs said. 
Half joking, he added: "You and I get a parking violation, and we get a $3 ticket." 

   Until last year, Mr. Jefferies lived in a huge oceanside house -- later sold for a reported $8.3 million -- that had a circular bed that rotated 360 degrees to take advantage of the view. 
He has given heavily to the arts, and has two galleries named for him in a Laguna Beach, Calif., museum. 

   A spokesman said Mr. Jefferies currently lives in the Palm Springs area, about 100 miles from Los Angeles. 
The executive has commuted to work almost every day, leaving his home at 1:30 a.m. in a chauffeur-driven limousine, according to the spokesman. 

   After attending college at the University of California, Los Angeles, Mr. Jefferies went to work as a cattle manager at a family-owned ranch in Arizona. 
He got his start in the securities business with a small brokerage firm in 1956. 

   Secrecy has been a major attraction of third-market firms. 
Jefferies has routinely identified clients only by a number or letter code to protect their identity. 

   "There is a legitimate confidentiality function. 
You never raise the curtain between client A and client B," said Wade Ambrose, vice chairman of Westlake Village, Calif.-based Jones &amp; Associates Inc., the third-largest trader in the third market. 
Referring to his competitor's problems, Mr. Ambrose said, "If anything, our business will be improved." 

   Despite publicity about Jefferies's role in accumulating and trading stock during takeover battles -- often during periods when the exchanges have halted trading -- less than 10% of the company's volume has come from takeover-related business, according to Mr. Baxter. 
He said Jefferies has diversified into areas such as convertible bonds and cash management for corporate clients. 

   Howard Marks, managing director of Trust Co. of the West, a Los Angeles investment manager, said his firm recently began using Jefferies in its trading of convertible debentures. 
"This won't affect our dealings with the firm. 
I can only believe this is an isolated instance and not pervasive in Jefferies," he added.

   Greyhound Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to buy General Motors Corp.'s U.S. transit bus and parts business. 
The price wasn't disclosed. 

   Greyhound, a food and consumer products company that produces about 1,000 buses a year for intercity use, said it expects the transaction to be completed in July. 
The companies had announced the proposed sale of the GM bus making operations in January. 

   GM makes 47-seat, diesel-powered buses for mass-transit use at plants in Pontiac, Mich., and St. Eustache, Quebec. 
Greyhound said its agreement with GM includes the right to purchase the Canadian transit bus and parts business, contingent upon reaching a satisfactory labor agreement. 
The Detroit-based concern will continue to produce school bus chassis. 

   Separately, Greyhound said it completed the previously announced $350 million sale of its bus lines to a group of investors led by Dallas businessman Fred G. Currey, a former president of Trailways Bus Lines Inc. 
The price consisted of $290 million in cash and $60 million in securities. 

   Mr. Currey, who recently negotiated a labor pact with Greyhound Lines' principal union, plans to move the company's headquarters to Dallas this summer.

That's No Hero, That's a CEO:
No Matter How Hard They Seem to Try,
Business Execs Don't Get Any Respect
---
By John Huey</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Professional basketball players are thrilled to be elected to the NBA all-star team. 
Baseball players exult at inclusion in the Hall of Fame. 
So, how does Coca-Cola Co.'s chairman and chief executive officer, Roberto Goizueta, feel about being named Advertising Age's 1986 Adman of the Year? 

   "That's the good news," he says. 
"The bad news is that last year's was Roger Smith (the beleaguered chairman of General Motors). 
The media made him a hero; now they're making him a goat." 

   Perhaps the point is, as Mr. Smith told this newspaper recently: "I wasn't as good as they said I was two years ago, and I'm not as bad as they say I am now." 

   Or perhaps the point really should be to examine the very idea of chief executives as heroes: Are they or aren't they? 
Should they or shouldn't they be? 
If so, whose heroes should they be -- shareholders' or society's -- and are the two mutually exclusive or compatible? 

   It's difficult to put a finger on precisely when or exactly why this idea of the CEO as hero emerged. 
I mean, they rarely hit anything out of the park, you can't dance to anything they do, and they certainly don't risk their lives to save anybody. 
Somehow, though, I suspect Lee Iacocca is heavily mixed up in current thinking on the subject. 

   When Chrysler Corp. was down for the count, Mr. Iacocca took a page from the lives of Joe Namath and Muhammed Ali (both bona fide heroes), and went before Congress to stage the corporate equivalent of personally guaranteeing he would beat the Colts, while simultaneously taunting Sonny Liston. 
When Chrysler got up and staggered back to its corner to continue the fight, the modern chief executive hero was born. 
Forget that the turnaround at Ford Motor Co. is in many ways a more impressive business achievement; how many Americans can identify Donald Petersen? 

   It wouldn't have worked, of course, if Mr. Iacocca were ugly or poorly spoken. 
This is truly the media age, a time when there is a place to print or a time to broadcast the most inconsequential doings of anyone remotely deemed to be a "public" person, as long as he has a little style. 
A friend, for example, recently suggested an idea for a nationally syndicated local cable TV show to be called "Lifestyles of the Nouveau Riche and Not Famous Until Now." 
And I wouldn't be surprised to see it catch on. 

   Not that Mr. Iacocca's business achievements were without substance. 
But who could've foreseen that his coup would inspire some guy to buy an electric shaver company, invade our living rooms with commercials about how much he likes the shavers and then write a book starring himself as the CEO hero? 
Probably anyone who could've predicted that Vanna White would grace the cover of Newsweek. 

   Somewhere in all this, that question of style vs. substance looms large. 
Allen H. Neuharth, the chairman and former CEO who built Gannett Co. into a media giant, is often interviewed about how he shaped the company and how he created USA Today. 
But he's also often asked why he only wears black and white and has black toilets in white bathrooms (he wears gray now in his eminence). 

   He says it's just for convenience and to keep from mismatching socks and ties and such. 
But we don't believe him, do we? 
This is a matter of style that one suspects he picked up from some role model (is there a little Hugh Hefner in this eccentricity?). 
And it leaves him open for detractors who can't find anything wrong with his P/E ratio to say things like: "You can't tell where the sharkskin ends and Al begins." 

   Mr. Neuharth is one who relishes corporate heroism. 
He was thrilled to sit in George Washington's church pew recently and receive the Poor Richard Club Gold Medal, placing him alongside the likes of Walt Disney, Dwight Eisenhower, Gen. David Sarnoff, William Paley, and, of course, Lee Iacocca. 

   Yet he concedes that many of his peers don't share such feelings. 
"Of the CEOs I know very well, the majority have been inclined to not want much public recognition," he says, perhaps because "most surveys seem to indicate that the public doesn't hold them (CEOs) in very high esteem." (Or is it because the currency of celebrity has been so incredibly debased?) 

   In any case, as Coke's Mr. Goizueta notes, most people don't have any idea what the substance of a CEO's job is anyway. 

   "Everyone wants to know 'What are you going to buy next? 
What are you going to sell?,'" he says. 
"That's what they think a CEO does today. 
The media like to focus on singular acts, like changing the (Coke) formula. 
This is a huge company to run. 
But if we tell them we've had a 25% compounded return since 1981 compared to the prior 10 years' return of less than 1%, they don't care. 
It's not sexy." 

   He's right, of course, it's not -- unless you're a shareholder. 
And even then you're more likely to think of the CEO as having done what you pay him enormously well to do, rather than as your hero. 

   Where it gets really confusing, though, is with the new breed of CEO/investment banker or "asset player." 
It's hard to embrace as heroes the folks who have made America's corporate landscape "more efficient on a yield basis" by dismantling or gobbling up all manner of companies without regard to synergy, or even compatibility, much less such intangible concepts as employee loyalty. 
The sole goal and product of their effort is money. 
They don't produce anything for society. 
They don't run companies; they own them. 
Then they sell them and buy some more. 
And the marketplace confirms their belief that money conquers all. 

   But they do appear to be the "heroes" if not the soul of the future. 
Surveys at the nation's elite business schools show that most future MBAs aspire to "investment banking" or "mergers and acquisitions," as opposed to such mundane pursuits as "manufacturing." 

   Now if you follow such things, think about this: What's the difference in the way you feel after you learn that your favorite overpaid NBA power forward has been busted for crack, and the way you feel when a rich investment banker is handcuffed and hauled off to jail for insider trading? 
Personally, I'll miss watching the forward's turnaround slammajamma, and I'm disappointed that he's so stupid. 
On the other hand, the shackling of the shark brings a smile to my face. 

   I suspect most of America agrees with me on this. 
And that's why most CEOs just can't be heroes even if they want to be. 
If they could, people would write country songs with titles like: "Mamas don't let your babies grow up to be CEOs."

In Search of Pioneer Spirit:
The Administration's Critic of 'Corpocracy'
Now Wonders if We All Aren't Turning Gray
---
By Richard G. Darman</HL>
<DD> 03/20/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   A few months ago when I noted that some parts of America's corporate establishment showed a tendency toward "corpocracy," my remarks seemed to touch a nerve. 

   Many people, including many executives, expressed strong agreement. 
But, in some quarters, an immediate dfensive reaction was evident. 
What struck me most about this defensiveness was the apparent sense of outrage that the subject had even been raised. 
Denial of the legitimacy of raising the subject seemed in itself a regrettable symptom. 

   By the same token, my remarks needed to be put in a broader perspective. 
I certainly did not intend to criticize all of business. 
And, it would be unfair to suggest that our competitiveness problem should be blamed solely on weakness in part of the corporate culture. 
To some degree, the corporate culture is a reflection of the larger culture in which it resides. 
And problems in one suggest the likelihood of problems in the other. 

   It's not simply that parts of corporate America seem to have turned a "corpocratic" gray. 
Sometimes America itself seems to be graying. 

   The idea of a graying America is hard to accept. 
America is meant to connote youthful vigor, romantic dreams, boundless opportunity, pioneering spirit. 
A graying America seems a contradiction in terms -- like Bruce Springsteen in a gray flannel suit. 

   Of course not all is turning to gray. 
Even in corporate culture, there are still colorful adventurers: Jobs, Pickens, and Perot, for example. 

   These are hardly dull conformists. (When I first met Steve Jobs, he had not yet become a media phenom. 
I mistakenly greeted one of his older, three-piece-suited associates as if he were the chairman of Apple Computer. 
It hadn't occurred to me that the then-chairman would be the one in an open shirt, wearing what looked like a refined version of Mr. T's neck chains.) 
But the very media attention that Jobs "et al" have received suggests that these flamboyant risk-takers are exceptions who prove a rule: Most corporate leadership is a rather conventional gray. 

   That is not necessarily a bad thing. 
An economy cannot afford to have everyone take high risks any more than a nation can have everyone explore new frontiers, or a football team can have everyone go out long. 

   But the question still presses itself upon us: Are we becoming a bit too gray -- losing our youthful energy and missionary vision as we age? 
Is our pioneering spirit flagging? 

   Clearly, the current interest in competitiveness suggests that there is some problem. 
Our huge current-account deficit has been a troubling symptom in the '80s. 
An even more troubling indicator is our comparative performance in productivity growth. 
It has been lagging since the '50s. 

   In the period 1950-1965, total U.S. business productivity grew at 3% a year. 
From 1965 to 1973, it grew at about 2%. 
And since 1973, it has grown at roughly 1%. 
But worse: Our manufacturing productivity has consistently grown more slowly than that of our major trading partners. 
From 1950 to 1985, ours grew at an average of 2.5% a year. 
Japan's grew at 8.4%. 
Germany's and Italy's grew at 5.5%, France's at 5.3% and Canada's at 3.5%. 
Even much-maligned Britain surpassed us, growing at an average of 3.1%. 

   There has been an abundance of excuses and explanations. 
Excessive fiscal deficits, the run-up of the dollar, asymmetry in our openness to imports, the LDC debt crisis -- all these contributed to our trade deficit. 
The destruction of Europe's and Japan's capital stock in World War II -- and their associated opportunity to rebuild from scratch -- played a part in our productivity lag. 
So, too, did the rise of our service sector (with lower measured productivity growth than manufacturing), as did the widespread integration in the labor force of previously excluded and undertrained minorities and women. 

   But warmed-over excuses for cold statistics should not lead us to underrate what appears to be a long-term secular trend: In the post-war era, we have been losing our edge. 

   Yes, America has made remarkable advances. 
We have pioneered in areas ranging from biotechnology to the industrialization of space. 
In more conventional fields, corporate America has managed substantial restructuring. 
And the twin deficits, fiscal and trade, seem to be turning in the right direction. 

   Still, we should not delude ourselves into thinking that the troublesome long-term trend will easily be put behind us. 
Beyond Japan is Korea, along with other rising Asian economic powers. 
Beyond the trade deficit is competition in services -- as well as an increase in "invisible" returns to foreign owners of U.S. debt and equity. 
Beyond a decline in relative economic power is a likely cost in foreign policy. 
And if the productivity lag is not reversed, America may face an identity problem: As Presidents Kennedy and Reagan have argued, America is not meant to be second best. 

   The federal government has been conspicuously clumsy and misguided at times. 
But to reverse the long-term trend we must not only examine government policy, as Washington is now doing. 
We must also examine our curiously self-satisfied culture. 

   Clearly, the symptoms of "corpocracy" are not confined to business. 
Some of our most vital support systems seem to be weakening with age. 
Our basic educational system, for example, has become a giant "mediocracy", one of the world's foremost manufacturers of the culturally and competitively mediocre. 

   We seem to have slipped into moral and intellectual complacency -- not just in some plush boardrooms, but generally. 
The work ethic is now rivaled by the leisure ethic, the consumption ethic and the "I-can-have-it-all" ethic. 
The Yuppie phenomenon is only the most visible outward sign of a pervasive and dull materialism -- unconnected with higher purpose, divorced from the idealistic tradition that sought to build a shining city upon a hill. 
It sometimes seems as if the rising stars of our commercial culture think Americans fought and died to make the world safe for wine coolers, the BMW, a year-end bonus and designer underwear. 

   Interdependence has risen. 
But we still tend to think of ourselves as protected by oceans, an isle unto ourselves. 
Comforted by our own rising standard of living, we have often forgotten to consider how our position is changing relative to other nations. 
But more basically: We have often lost sight of our higher standards, those that would expand the limits of human potential, and give meaning to our endeavors. 

   It is as if we were fading back into the gray self-satisfaction of the '50s. 
But the world has changed. 
To meet its challenges, we need to reawaken the spirit of America's youth. 
Self-examination is a useful start. 
The trade deficit should do for us now what Sputnik did: infuse not just corporate culture, but the larger society, with renewed vigor and vision -- calling us again to our more vibrant colors.

   Edith Reich, formerly a foreign-trade representative for Dayco Corp., pleaded guilty to defrauding the company of more than $12 million in false commissions. 

   Mrs. Reich, 63 years old, admitted in federal court that she and others defrauded Dayco of the money while she represented the company between 1979 and 1981. 
The chemicals, plastics and rubber company, based in Dayton, Ohio, recently sold most of its rubber operations and changed its name to Day International. 

   Mrs. Reich was arrested last June. 
Prosecutors said she is cooperating in a continuing investigation. 

   As previously reported, Mrs. Reich represented Dayco in negotiating and securing orders for the purchase of Dayco goods through Soviet foreign-trade organizations. 
In her guilty plea, she admitted receiving commissions for more than $100 million in nonexistent orders for Dayco goods. 

   Mrs. Reich worked for Dayco as president and chief operating officer of Foreign Transactions Corp. and Trachem Co. 
She faces a maximum five-year prison term and $1,000 fine at sentencing April 29. 

   Dayco previously won a $19 million judgment in a civil suit against Mrs. Reich in 1984. 
The judgment included certain damages in addition to the amount of the commissions.

Board membership is reduced to 12. 

   While declining to discuss the reasons behind Mr. McLendon's departure, SJNB's chairman, Arthur Lund, emphasized that the move "doesn't indicate any problem" at the holding company or its units. 
The company and its loan portfolio are "in excellent shape," he said. 

   In 1986, SJNB had net income of $407,000, or 34 cents a share, off 35% from a year earlier. 
Year-end assets were $126.2 million.

Pound, Dollar
Decline a Bit;
Trading Is Quiet

   The British pound's rally paused, and the U.S. dollar also eased in quiet foreign exchange trading yesterday. 

   Trading was subdued by concern about possible central-bank intervention to prevent exchange rates for both the pound and dollar from venturing beyond the levels of recent dealings. 

   Anxiety about central-bank intrusion into currency markets is caused by last month's exchange-rate stabilization agreement among the U.S. and its top five economic allies, traders said. 
Most major currencies have traded in a relatively narrow band since the accord by the Group of Six, or G-6, was announced in Paris Feb. 22. 

   "Despite everyone's expectations that the market would challenge the G-6's supposed ranges of tolerance, the test of their resolve isn't any closer than it was a month ago," said James S. Vick, vice president and senior corporate trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York. 

   While overall foreign-exchange activity was light yesterday, trading in sterling, and especially between sterling and West German marks, continued to dominate the market, dealers said. 

   "The market is moribund. 
It's difficult to see what's going to shake the dollar out of the doldrums. 
The only action is in sterling and sterling-Deutsche mark," said Peter Rogers, vice president and chief foreign exchange dealer at Banca Nazionale Dell'Agricoltura in New York. 

   Sterling lost ground yesterday as it encountered relatively heavy corporate selling and traders who were reluctant to buy the currency for fear of intervention by the Bank of England. 
Concern about the central bank selling pounds was raised Wednesday after Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson, reiterated his opposition to further strengthening of the pound. 
"Some people think the Bank of England is holding a sword over sterling, and that its potential is limited," Mr. Vick of Manufacturers Hanover said. 

   The pound was unaffected by the favorable news that Britain's unemployment rate fell to 11.1% in February from 11.3% in January. 

   In late New York trading, the pound stood at $1.6003, down from $1.6080 Wednesday. 
Sterling also fell to 2.9338 marks, from 2.9513. 

   The dollar slipped to 1.8333 marks, from 1.8354, and to 151.48 Japanese yen, from 151.86. 

   The dollar's uneventful dealings were due to a lack of consensus about U.S. economic growth prospects, compared to the rest of the industrialized world, as well as to worries about central bank intervention, traders said. 
"You don't have any major reason to go in either direction," said Francois Soares-Kemp, vice president and chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais in New York. 

   In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 151.35 yen from 151.48 yen in New York yesterday afternoon. 

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery rose 20 cents an ounce to $405.30 in light trading. 
The estimated volume was 1.8 million ounces. 

   Gold was quoted at $405.60 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.

   France Increases Reserves
   PARIS -- France continued an aggressive drive to boost its
foreign exchange reserves in the week ended March 12,
according to a weekly statement by its central bank.
   The Bank of France reported that its currency deposits
increased 6% to the equivalent of $19.79 billion, from $18.67
billion a week earlier. The bank's holdings of gold and
foreign currency rose 1.6% to the equivalent of $70.8
billion, the highest level in six months, from $69.69
billion.
   The figures tend to confirm speculation that France has
bought currencies heavily since reserves were depleted by
intervention to defend the franc before the currency's
devaluation within the European Monetary System Jan. 11.

   MCorp, Texas's largest bank holding company, said it plans to convert 35 of its 62 banking units into branches, and it said it realigned its top management. 

   MCorp said it will begin conversion to the branch structure in the El Paso area, in the second quarter. 
Similar conversions in the Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Austin and San Antonio areas will follow. 

   Texas recently changed its banking laws to allow a limited form of branch banking. 
Rigid state laws had required each banking facility to be a separately chartered bank and had prohibited branches. 
MCorp said that it expects to save money through consolidation of operations. 
It also said its customers will benefit from increased convenience and services. 
MCorp's plans follow similar announcements by other Texas banking firms. 

   MCorp, which has $21.9 billion in assets, also said it has formed a 10-member management committee to design company policy. 
The group consists of Gene H. Bishop, chairman and chief executive officer; John T. Cater, president and chief operating officer; and eight senior executives each of whom was given the new title of group chairman. 
The eight group chairmen and their areas of responsibility are: B. Lamar Ball Jr., regional banking, retail and marketing; Peter B. Bartholow, planning and finance; George L. Clark, Dallas region, financial institutions and real estate; James B. Gardner, corporate banking, investments and treasury; J. Thomas Hudgins, managed assets; Charles E. McMahen, operations and administration; James M. Spellings, trust and investment management services; and C. Richard Vermillion Jr., Houston region and energy. 
MCorp's 19 managing directors report to group chairmen, MCorp said.

   American Home Shield Corp. said it arranged for the private placement of 1.2 million common shares previously owned by Ticor Title Insurance Co. 

   The home warranty company issued the shares, which represent a 17% stake in the company, to Ticor Title as part of the purchase price when it acquired the Los Angeles-based concern's Ticor Home Warranty Co. unit in 1985. 

   Ticor Title had been American Home Shield's largest holder. 
An official said Robinson Humphrey Co. of Atlanta placed the stock with 15 investors, none of whom now holds more than 200,000 shares. 
The price wasn't disclosed. 
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, American Shield closed at $8.25, up 25 cents. 

   Separately, American Home reported fourth-quarter net income rose 6% to $1 million, or 15 cents a share, from $969,000, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue for the quarter rose 40% to $10.9 million from $7.8 million a year ago. 

   For the year, net, helped by a $1 million tax benefit, grew to $2.4 million, or 33 cents a share. 
Year-earlier net, after a charge of $551,000 from write-offs of goodwill and settlement of litigation, was $90,000. 
Preferred dividend requirements exceeded net income. 
Revenue rose 88% to $38.2 million from $20.3 million a year ago.

<HL> Phillips's Global Energy Reserves Fall;
Firm Spent Little on Exploration in '86

<TEXT>
   Phillips Petroleum Co. said its global crude oil reserves fell 20% last year, while its overall energy reserves slid 6%. 

   Analysts say the declines are further indication that Phillips is liquidating at a faster rate than other major oil companies. 
Like most oil companies, Phillips invested relatively little in exploration last year because of low oil and gas prices. 

   The energy concern also is highly leveraged, with long-term debt of $5.76 billion at year's end, and has been selling oil and gas properties to reduce its debt load. 

   "It suggests to me that they are fighting an uphill battle and they are losing," says Sanford Margoshes, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. 

   The disclosure of reserve data in the company's annual report comes on the heels of active trading in Phillips's stock that has pushed the stock price as high as $15.675 a share -- the highest level since early 1985. 

   Phillips has been the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange twice this week, with more than four million shares changing hands on both Tuesday and Wednesday. 
In composite trading, Phillips shares dropped 25 cents to close at $15.125 each on volume of 1.7 million shares. 

   Analysts attributed the stock activity to firmer oil prices and more confidence in the company's future, but they cautioned that the company's debt still makes it a relatively risky investment. 
"I prefer other companies in the energy group," says Edith Barschi, a Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. analyst. 

   The company said its U.S. oil reserves fell 24% during 1986. 
Its U.S. natural gas reserves declined 10%. 

   World-wide, however, Phillips's gas reserves grew 5%, primarily because of revisions in reserves at the company's Ekofisk field in Norway. 
As previously reported, the Norway reserves were reduced in 1985 because Phillips had to reinject natural gas into the field to keep it from subsiding. 
The amount of gas reinjected was reduced in 1986, allowing the company to again count the reserves. 

   The company's global natural gas liquids reserves grew 13%, while its U.S. natural gas liquids reserves increased 28%. 

   Overall, Phillips reserves declined less than the 11% the company predicted last fall because of the adjustment to the Ekofisk field and because U.S. natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves were higher than initial evaluations indicated.

<HL> AMC Board to Meet Amid Speculation
That Chrysler May Be Forced to Lift Bid

<TEXT>
   American Motors Corp.'s board is to meet again today amid investor speculation -- perhaps optimistic -- that Chrysler Corp. may be pressured to sweeten its $4-a-share bid for the company. 

   Chrysler last week agreed to acquire from Regie Nationale des Usines Renault its 46.1% stake in ailing AMC, and proposed to buy the rest of AMC in a stock swap valued at $4 a share. 
The total transaction, which includes Chrysler stock, bonds and cash, is valued at as much as $1.11 billion. 

   Yet AMC's stock, which had been trading around $3.50 a share, immediately jumped above $4 on news of the proposal and has stubbornly stayed there on heavy volume. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, AMC shares closed at $4.375, up 12.5 cents, and Chrysler shares closed at $53.50, down 12.5 cents, both in light trading. 

   "What the market seems to be saying is that American Motors may hold out for a higher price from Chrysler" for public shareholders, said David Healy, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 
"The board isn't overwhelmed by the Chrysler offer." 

   Nor are some Wall Street traders, some of whom believe Renault is getting a better deal than other AMC shareholders. 
"You might see another dollar" added to Chrysler's per-share offer, one arbitrager contended, saying his firm took a position in AMC after it topped $4 a share. 
Another arbitrager said her firm bought 200,000 shares of AMC for $4.25 each after calculating that Chrysler's agreement with Renault, which contains variables based on AMC's future performance, ultimately will give Renault as much as $8 to $9 a share. 
Her firm is gambling that AMC thus will be able to wring more from Chrysler for other shareholders. 

   Not everyone believes in that gamble. 
"I'm telling my clients they should sell American Motors shares," said Ronald Glantz, an analyst at Montgomery Securities. 
"I don't think there's going to be a sweetener." 
He said that upon completion of the agreement with Renault, AMC warrants and junior convertible preferred shares that would be part of the transaction would help give Chrysler control of the board. 
Even though Chrysler at that point wouldn't have two-thirds of the voting stock necessary to approve the acquisition, he said Chrysler nonetheless might not feel pressured to buy out minority holders, though it has said it wants all of AMC. AMC has about 116.7 million shares outstanding. 

   Wall Street analysts don't see any other bidders stepping forward, though last year Ford Motor Co. evaluated and rejected making an offer. 
Still, AMC has retained Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. to review Chrysler's bid. 
And if Shearson concludes that $4 a share is inadequate, AMC may gain some additional bargaining leverage. 
But Charles Brady, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said, "I think $4 (a share) is going to be accepted as a fair offer." 
An AMC spokesman said he expects Shearson to present at least a preliminary opinion at today's AMC board meeting. 

   So far, AMC has been coy with Chrysler, issuing terse news releases saying merely that the Southfield, Mich.-based auto maker is evaluating Chrysler's proposal. 
AMC executives have said they are frustrated about the timing of the bid, contending AMC was just about to turn the corner after a string of troubled years. 
The company's Jeep sales are strong and AMC is just now introducing lines of larger Renault cars that could finally give it a position in a broader segment of the auto market -- but only if currently skeptical buyers start returning to AMC's showrooms. 

   Investors "think Chrysler is buying American Motors at the pivotal time," another arbitrage specialist said. 

   Under Chrysler's stock swap offer, an AMC holder could get more than $4 a share if Chrysler's stock exceeds $58.22 before the shares are exchanged. 
Some investors may be gambling on that appreciation and have chosen to buy AMC stock, instead of more expensive Chrysler shares, because "this is a way of playing Chrysler for $4," one source familiar with the acquisition bid said. 
Nonetheless, Chrysler shares have continued to trade in the low 50s since the proposal was announced. 
Chrysler wouldn't say whether it is buying AMC stock.

<HL> AT&amp;T Sets News Conference to Bolster
Its Credibility in the Computer Industry

   In an attempt to buttress its flagging credibility in the computer industry, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. plans a big news conference next Tuesday to showcase new products and its latest top computer executive, Vittorio Cassoni. 

   Separately, James E. Edwards, an AT&amp;T senior vice president who preceded Mr. Cassoni as head of the computer division, said he is leaving the company, effective Monday. 

   According to managers in the computer, or Data Systems, division, AT&amp;T will announce new products that include an addition to its 3B minicomputer line, software products to connect its machines to those of International Business Machines Corp., a laser printer, the latest version of the Unix V operating system software and some local area network products. 

   None of the products are technologically significant but mainly catch up with competitors, AT&amp;T managers and consultants said. 
The announcements, to be made at AT&amp;T headquarters in three separate meetings with consultants, reporters and industry analysts, are meant to show that Mr. Cassoni and AT&amp;T are still serious about selling computers. 
The intent, AT&amp;T sources say, is to "reassure customers unsettled by events of the past six months" and "convince customers who are still 'on the fence' that AT&amp;T is the right choice." 

   AT&amp;T's credibility in computers has plummeted as it has reshuffled management, posted pre-tax 1986 operating losses of $1.2 billion in the division, and appeared to be de-emphasizing computers in favor of long-distance phone service. 

   Product sales have been dismal recently; according to AT&amp;T sources, the company in January sold a mere 2,000 PC 6300 and 6300 Plus personal computers, its most successful machine, against a business plan of 120,000 for the year. 
Last year, sources say, the company took a $100 million write-off, in two steps, on its Unix PC, and stopped ordering the machine, resulting in layoffs and salary cuts at its maker, Convergent Technologies Inc., San Jose, Calif. 

   Several Data Systems executives have quit recently. 
John Walsh, a vice president in charge of the 3B minicomputer line, surprised colleagues in January when he left to join a small West Coast videoconferencing concern. 
And just yesterday Mr. Edwards said he is leaving to become president and chief executive officer of TelWatch Inc., a Boulder, Col., developer of systems to manage networks. 

   "I've escaped," said Mr. Edwards. 
Telwatch "had been working on me for the last 30 to 35 days to see if they could tempt me to leave Big Mama. 
I've always had the ambition to run my own company." 

   Though Mr. Cassoni has a tough job ahead of him, he is trying hard to reestablish AT&amp;T's credibility. 
He attended an important personal computer industry conference in Phoenix, Ariz., last month -- the first year that AT&amp;T has gone to that particular conference. 
"Vittorio seemed a lot more interested in what the industry is doing" than past AT&amp;T computer executives, said John Sculley, chairman of Apple Computer Inc. 

   Mr. Edwards, who cited a number of reasons for AT&amp;T's trouble in computers, also said he thought Mr. Cassoni's job will be made easier by his coming from Ing. 
C. Olivetti &amp; Co. of Italy, which has agreed to make and develop all AT&amp;T personal computers and workstations. 
He said he supported the decision made last October to replace him with Mr. Cassoni. 

   In Mr. Cassoni, "you aren't bringing in just another outsider. 
You are listening to a strategic partner," Mr. Edwards said. 
Since Mr. Cassoni arrived, "my observation is that the strategic relationship with Olivetti is working better," he said. 
AT&amp;T previously had disputes with Olivetti over transfer pricing and marketing strategy. 

   Industry consultants said Mr. Cassoni's approach thus far is to rank products in terms of profitability and cut those that aren't money makers. 
"He is either going to make it profitable or they are going to get out of the business, and I figure he has two years to do it," said David Taylor, a program director at Gartner Group who left AT&amp;T's computer division last April. 

   But product managers also grumble that, because of directives from Mr. Cassoni's bosses, whose experience is in AT&amp;T's regulated long-distance business, expenses are being restricted so much that they can't adequately serve customers. 
According to some, each product manager is allowed only $3,000 a year for travel and entertainment. 
On that budget, product managers say, they can't determine what customers need, let alone sell them anything. 

   An AT&amp;T spokesman wouldn't comment on specifics, but said the company would spend what was necessary to sell products. 

   "If they really restrict them to that, there is going to be a lot of time spent over the phone," said Mr. Taylor. 
"They won't be able to hold people to that and get products out." 

   In addition, Mr. Cassoni is plagued by the same problem that hurt Mr. Edwards: He doesn't have his own sales force to sell computers, but has to rely on a sales force that also sells long distance service, modems, multiplexers, telephones and office switchboards. 

   One source said Mr. Cassoni's boss, Sam R. Willcoxon, president of the Business Markets Group, refused to give him his own sales force. 
Unless the company changes its mind, the source said, "they are going to have a very, very hard time being successful in anything except long distance."

To Curb Price Swings

Futures Exchanges Officials React Cautiously

   A top Securities and Exchange Commission official proposed brief, simultaneous trading halts in stock and stock-index markets to combat excessive price volatility. 

   Richard Ketchum, head of market regulation for the SEC, said such an unprecedented step would eliminate the "potential for a cascade or snowballing effect" in the two markets, with heavy selling in stocks and stock-index futures feeding on itself. 

   He proposed the idea at a Futures Industry Association convention here, where the stock-price swings often associated with index-futures trading have dominated discussions. 
While a market crash is unlikely, Mr. Ketchum said, the prospect "can't be discarded entirely." 

   Regulators' struggle to moderate stock-price swings takes on added urgency this afternoon, during the quarterly "triple witching hour." 
Traders and analysts are predicting extremely heavy volume near the close on the New York Stock Exchange, when stock-index futures, options and individual stock options all expire simultaneously. 

   In a related development, Chicago Mercantile Exchange officials discarded a previous plan aimed at addressing the problem. 
Bowing to pressure from securities firms, Merc officials said at the conference that they have withdrawn a controversial proposal, pending with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to place a 12-point daily limit on price moves in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index futures market. 
The S&amp;P pit is the biggest index futures market by far, accounting for more than 75% of all stock-index futures volume. 

   Several big securities firms that are members of the Merc objected to the idea, predicting that the price limit would become a "self-fulfilling prophecy," William Brodsky, the Merc's president, said. 
Fears that prices would hit the limit could send traders scrambling to close out their positions, thereby accelerating the price moves, he said. 
A "limit move" usually effectively halts trading by drying up bids or offers. 

   Critics of limits also said that once the Merc's Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures contract had reached its 12-point limit up or down from the previous day's close, traders would simply transfer all their activity to the stock market, which trades without limits. 

   An SEC report on the volatility issue is set for release Monday. 
The agency studied swings in stock and stock-index prices last Sept. 11, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 115 points in just over an hour before rebounding, and on certain days in December and January. 

   Mr. Ketchum said the SEC concluded that a fundamental change in investors' market outlook, reflected first in the declining bond market that day, was the main reason for the precipitous decline Sept. 11 and the following day. 

   Arbitrage trading, or simultaneous activity in stock-index futures and stocks, was "a very substantial part but by no means a predominant part" of the forces driving the decline, he said. 

   Mr. Ketchum said his suggestion for a joint trading halt, characterized by some industry executives as a trial balloon, was his idea, although he had discussed it with other senior SEC officials. 

   He proposed the idea, Mr. Ketchum said, as a way of "building on (Big Board chairman) John Phelan's suggestion of a safety net" to keep the stock and stock-index futures markets from becoming locked into a precipitous pas de deux. 

   Futures-exchange executives were guarded in their response. 
Although Mr. Brodsky said he wasn't aware of Mr. Ketchum's trading-halt proposal before hearing it yesterday, he said it was "worth discussing." 

   Lewis Horowitz, president of the New York Futures Exchange, a Big Board subsidiary that trades stock-index futures and options, said he would favor a meeting among stock and futures exchanges to consider the idea. 

   Mr. Ketchum also suggested that futures exchanges should consider allowing securities firms to use their capital to execute large trades that couldn't be accommodated by traders in the futures pits. 
He drew a parallel with block trading on the Big Board, in which securities firms risk their own capital to match big trades off the trading floor. 

   Futures exchanges had been expected to lobby hard against further regulation at the convention on the grounds that more restrictions would hurt, rather than help futures markets. 

   Many futures industry officials are watching to see if additional steps taken by the Merc recently to curb abuses in the S&amp;P 500 pit will be adopted by, or pressed upon, other futures exchanges. 
The Merc last week announced reforms that, if adopted, will sharply restrict its S&amp;P 500 brokers from the industry-wide practice of trading for their own as well as customer accounts.

Agree to Changes
To Prevent Delays

   The nation's airlines ended four days of meetings here, agreeing to make about 275 changes in their summer flight schedules to head off delays during peak times, according to Federal Aviation Administration officials. 

   In addition, said Edward Faberman, deputy chief counsel for the agency, the carriers had made about 70 changes immediately before the sessions began and have agreed to try to make more revisions for Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in coming weeks. 
The main carriers at those airports will meet again with the FAA April 10. 

   The meetings, which the FAA supervised, convened Monday under a Transportation Department grant of antitrust immunity. 
The department contended that the carriers had scheduled too many flights at peak times, and that adjustments were needed to prevent delays this summer. 
Besides Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth, other airports included in the talks were Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, Newark, N.J., International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport. 

   Mr. Faberman said he was generally pleased with the results of the meetings -- except in the case of the Atlanta airport, where the carriers fell about 90 changes short of the goal of 290 revisions. 
"We're all a little disappointed about that," he said. 

   The carriers made about four dozen changes at Chicago, one at Dallas-Fort Worth and 13 each at Newark and Philadelphia. 
Mr. Faberman said that he was satisfied with the new schedules for Newark and Philadelphia, and that he hoped additional changes at Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth could be made at the April meeting. 

   The changes agreed to this week will involve the airlines' April-October schedules.

Computer Stocks Weakest of OTC Technology Group

   As technology stocks go, recent history suggests, so goes the over-the-counter market. 
And OTC technology stock prices have been slipping this month. 

   They are slipping from far loftier price levels than most investors realize they've attained and, analysts say, that may be one reason why several major categories of OTC technology stocks are particularly vulnerable right now. 

   Technology issues comprise the second biggest group of stocks in the OTC market -- some 28% of the 4,600 stocks in the OTC's Nasdaq automated quotation system. 

   While bank and financial stocks outnumber the technology issues, embracing one-third of the Nasdaq issues, their prices tend to proceed at a more leisurely pace. 
When prices of the volatile biotechnology, computer and electronic stocks all begin moving rapidly in the same direction, up or down, they can move the OTC composite 5% or more in a matter of days. 

   The current weakness in technology is confined to computer-related stocks, which have dropped about 5% in the past few weeks after roaring ahead more than 65% in the first two months of the year. 
Biotechnology and electronics stocks, the other two major technology subgroups, are still managing to creep ahead. 

   Followers of the computer-related stocks are watching International Business Machines Corp., which is about to disclose details of its clone-proof microcomputers. 
IBM's announcement, expected in the first week of April, will make clearer which companies will be affected and how. 

   "Investors are trying to guess what effect the new IBM clone-proof microcomputers will have on the various companies," explains Charles Wolf, an analyst at First Boston Corp. 
Among the worst hit are some of the disk-drive makers who have benefited from sales related to IBM's current models. 
They have tumbled in price, dragging down with them even the stock prices of unrelated companies such as Maxtor Corp., a disk-drive maker whose sales have nothing to do with these IBM models. 

   "Many investors just buy or sell groups," says Mr. Wolf. 

   Despite a slight recovery in the computer issues this week, the problem could get worse. 
"The market hasn't fully factored in IBM. Computer stocks could move down further when the announcement occurs," he adds. 

   Analysts say that the three big groupings of technology stocks don't have an effect on one another, but when all three move up together, as they have this year, they can boost the broad performance measures of the whole OTC market. 
Thus, this year's more than 50% jump in OTC technology stock prices has been the principal driving force behind a concurrent 25% rise in the Nasdaq composite index. 

   The huge technology stock price rise, verified by a broad Wall Street Journal sampling, has been far greater than many investors realize. 
That's because the indexes commonly used to gauge technology stock trends, such as the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index, are imperfect measures of such performance in the OTC market. 
The PSE technology measure is up only 33% this year. 

   The PSE technology index also includes exchange-listed technology stocks, which have moved in a different pattern than the OTC issues this year. 
IBM alone accounts for 5% of this PSE index. 
And while IBM has driven the OTC computer group prices lower this month, its own price has risen 5% in recent weeks. 

   The OTC subgroup that has proved most volatile over the past few years is biotechnology, where stock prices still are moving up a bit. 
But, some analysts say, many of these stocks may now be fully priced and vulnerable. 

   "The stocks are already pretty nicely priced relative to future earnings," says Robert Kupor, biotechnology stock analyst with Cable, Howse &amp; Ragen in Seattle. 
In fact, he says, multiples based on estimates of future earnings are about where they were in the second quarter of last year, when the biotechnology market peaked. 

   He also says the market in these stocks is psychologically driven, with investors reacting to guesses about what the companies may do in 1990 or 1992, rather than to current performance. 
Given that, and their lofty price levels, Mr. Kupor says he would "not be stunned to see the biotechnology market top out" as a result of "any one or two negative events" such as a delay in federal approval of a drug or a decision in patent law. 

   Stocks now moving the biotechnology group are the biomedical issues, including such stocks as Centocor Inc., up 12% since the beginning of March. 

   Like most other companies gaining ground in this group, there is an AIDS play. 
Centocor is working on an vaccine against acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 

   Sometimes the connection to AIDS is tenuous. 
Amgen Corp., also up sharply in the past few weeks, is moving on speculation that a product it is developing to treat anemia may find a large market once the Food and Drug Administration approves azidothymidine, or AZT, a proposed AIDS treatment made by Burroughs-Wellcome Co. That's because anemia is one of the reported side effects of AZT. 
"The company also has a protein that could be given instead of transfusions, making it a double AIDS play," says Mr. Kupor. 
"But who knows? 
Everyone is guessing." 

   In the electronics group, many semiconductor, microwave relay and other communications issues have been lackluster performers this month. 
But other shares have been advancing so strongly that they are lifting the performance of the group as a whole. 
These hot stocks include optical scanning and industrial robot development stocks, which were hardest hit in last fall's technology stock sell-off and have been among the last to recover this year.

To Materialize

   Sometimes a takeover bid isn't really a bid. 

   A spate of conditional acquisition proposals in the past year has confounded Wall Street arbitragers, who have lost money betting on "bids" proposed -- but never formally made -- for such companies as USX Corp., Lucky Stores Inc. and Borg-Warner Corp. 

   Here is an example of what happens: 

   Last Nov. 25, Borg-Warner directors received a letter from Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs, who together with Minstar Inc. controlled 7.7% of the plastics, car parts and chemicals concern and proposed to buy the rest for $43 to $48 a share. 

   Although the figures he used were quite specific, Mr. Jacobs said he wanted to see the books before negotiating a friendly acquisition. 
Even though his letter didn't constitute a formal offer, it was referred to in news stories as a "bid" or an "offer," and the stock rose $1.375, to $39, in response. 

   But the gulf between the stock price and the figures cited by Mr. Jacobs reflected skepticism that such a bid would really arrive. 
The letter was viewed as a move to hasten a restructuring, or to spark a bid by another Borg holder, GAF Corp. 

   Since then the company largely has ignored Mr. Jacobs, who threatened a hostile tender offer Feb. 19, and the stock has lagged behind the market. 

   Such tactics are "in vogue," because they are "a cost efficient way of stirring up the stew," said Arthur Fleischer, a merger lawyer at Fried Frank Harris Shriver &amp; Jacobson. 

   "What is a postage stamp, 22 cents?" he said. 
"You can cause a lot of consequences to a company by simply sending a letter. 
Basically, you may -- but not necessarily -- put the company in play," he said. 

   Lawrence Schloss, a mergers executive at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, said of those who make the proposals: "Some are your basic greenmail artists. 
Some are bona fide buyers who see value but really don't have the appropriate information to make an offer. 
And some are a combination of the two." 

   In an interview, Mr. Jacobs said he didn't write the letter merely to stir the stew or put Borg-Warner in play, and said the company has agreed to talk to him. 
"Don't assume nothing is happening. 
Don't assume we're just sitting here waiting for the phone to ring," he added. 

   But he acknowledged that disclosure of a proposal may put pressure on a company to deal with a suitor. 
"I think people who are running certain companies pay more attention to what Wall Street says sometimes. 
And if no one knows anything, then there's no pressure (for the company) to say anything." 

   In a typical pattern, an investor will buy a 5% stake, try to get arbitragers to buy shares, and then make a bid "proposal" to focus attention on the potential values. 
Mr. Schloss said that target companies must usually hire investment bankers to evaluate the proposal. 
"They have a fiduciary obligation to see if it's real and then respond." 

   Once in play, the target company may negotiate with the "bidder," seek a rescuing suitor, or execute a restructuring to boost the stock price. 
Plenty of takeover attempts turn into mergers or leveraged buyouts through just such a process. 

   "Maybe it's a way of starting talks with management. 
It works if you can find weak management that perceives itself as weak," said Juliusz Sas, a special situations analyst at the brokerage house Balis Zorn Gerard Inc. who has followed the Borg-Warner siege. 
"It's like pointing at them with an unloaded gun." 

   But for the corporate raider forced to pull the trigger in such a circumstance, the results can be an embarrassing "click." 
That's what happened at the denouement of Asher Edelman's pursuit of Lucky Stores, a California grocery chain. 

   Mr. Edelman's pursuit of Lucky had all the twists and turns of a Gothic novel. 
After accumulating a reported 3% stake, he proposed a $35-a-share friendly purchase in a letter disclosed Sept. 24. 
He demanded that any restructuring be "prompt and efficient. 
Lip service will not satisfy me." 

   After company officials refused to meet Mr. Edelman, Lucky stock peaked at $37.875 in early October on reports that the investor was ready to launch a hostile tender offer. 
But he didn't follow through on that threat after Lucky formally rejected the proposal Oct. 6 and began a defensive restructuring and stock buyback. 

   The investor then raised his proposed bid to $37 a share. 
Lucky rejected it again. 
Mr. Edelman dropped his proposal, then renewed it again Nov. 19 after buying more shares. 
But after holders approved the restructuring in late December, the stock fell to $26. 

   (Mr. Edelman was more determined in his pursuit of Ponderosa Inc. 
He disclosed a 19% stake in late November, and without further preliminaries, launched a tender offer Dec. 2 that, after some sweetening, snared the company.) 

   Two weeks ago, Mr. Edelman reached a three-year standstill agreement limiting his Lucky stake to 5% and barring him from attempting to gain control. 
Lucky paid him just $2.8 million to cover expenses. 

   Although Lucky shares have rebounded to $31.875, they have lagged behind the market since the takeover attempt, and some arbitragers are bitter. 
"As far as I'm concerned, he sold his credibility for $2.8 million," said one. 

   Mr. Edelman was out of the country this week and couldn't be reached for comment. 
His lawyer, Burton Lehman of Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel, said that while Mr. Edelman's proposals "weren't bids in the nature of a tender offer, they were serious bids seeking to work out a basis to purchase the company. 
But the company rejected each of them and went ahead and did its restructuring." 

   Perhaps the most prominent "non-bid" bid was Carl Icahn's run on USX. Mr. Icahn and several other corporate raiders had taken positions in the depressed stock. 
On Oct. 6, he proposed a "friendly" $31-a-share acquisition, subject to a look at the books, but threatened a hostile tender if the company didn't accept or undertake a "radical" restructuring. 

   One prominent merger lawyer said arbitragers erroneously "treated Icahn's conditional approach to U.S. Steel as an unconditional bid. 
It wasn't a bid. 
He said he would make a bid 'if-if-if.' 
But the Street treated them as a company that was in play." 

   Mr. Icahn and USX management soon became embroiled in a lengthy effort to agree on conditions under which the investor could look at the books. 
Then the insider-trading scandals that broke in mid-November tainted his investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert, putting in doubt some raiders' ability to get financing and leaving Mr. Icahn stuck in USX. 
The stock fell to 20 before rebounding on higher oil prices. 
In January, he abandoned the effort, but still owns the stock. 

   This month, Mr. Icahn and his Trans World Airlines made a proposal for a bid that got set aside before it was ever made. 
TWA bought 15% of USAir Group stock and suggested it might bid $52 a share for the whole company after USAir made a bid to acquire Piedmont Aviation. 

   The Icahn move was widely interpreted as an effort to foil a combination that stood to rob him of two choice candidates to merge with -- or, preferably, buy -- TWA. 
But USAir rejected the bid as "highly conditional," among other things. 
After a federal judge blocked further purchases and Piedmont agreed to merge with USAir, Mr. Icahn said he wouldn't seek control for the moment. 

   Many bona fide tender offers are contingent on the target company dropping anti-takeover provisions, including a bid this week by AFG Industries and Wagner &amp; Brown for GenCorp. 
Takeover experts said it is also legitimate for would-be acquirers to want to see a company's books. 

   But last summer, Wagner &amp; Brown made a proposal for a bid that never went through. 
Wagner &amp; Brown suggested paying $50 a share for Panhandle Eastern Corp. last June 30, and the stock initially surged near that price. 

   But Panhandle soon rejected the bid and took a $460 million charge to settle a dispute with Algeria. 
Terms included what amounted to an anti-takeover provision giving the Algerians the right to sell Panhandle stock back to the company at an above-market price. 
The stock sank to $40 following those moves, as investors began to fear Wagner &amp; Brown wouldn't really make a bid. 

   Possibly fearing another takeover move, Panhandle then spun off its most attractive asset, Anadarko Petroleum Corp., and the two stocks combined eventually rose well above the $50 figure. 

   A proposed bid in the oil patch that never actually materialized came from Canada's Belzberg family for Ashland Oil Inc. a year ago. 
The Belzbergs said they were prepared to pay $60 a share, but later accepted $51 a share from the company for their 9.2% stake. 

   Skeptics are already wondering about a proposal Feb. 23 from Columbia Ventures, a Miami-based partnership that said it might pay $19 a share for Harnischfeger Industries Inc. 
The stock, which initially ran up to $18.25 on the news, has since retreated to $17.625. 

   Of course, how a company treats a proposal varies according to the proposer's identity. 
Mr. Schloss of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette said if it's, say, Texaco Inc., directors have to consider it seriously. 
But, as Borg-Warner observed last month: "We do not consider letters from Mr. Jacobs as formal offers or legally binding." 

   In deciding how to value a target company's stock, arbitragers go through a similar thought process. 
Even though they have all taken greenmail in the past, Messrs. 
Icahn and Jacobs and Canada's Belzbergs have gained credibility by actually buying companies on occasion. 

   However, one takeover speculator focuses on the target company instead of on the proposer. 
"It doesn't matter whether the bidder is serious," says this arbitrager. 
"You look to see whether the target is going to care. 
Just look at the board of directors. 
People who are from the Boy Scouts of America" aren't likely to put up as much resistance as "someone whose name is on the company."

Beals Takes Harley-Davidson on New Road

   Vaughn L. Beals Jr. got up at a Washington news conference earlier this week and offered to give up what many U.S. chief executives would dearly love to have -- a stiff tariff against foreign competitors. 

   The chairman and chief executive officer of Harley-Davidson Inc., the Milwaukee-based motorcycle maker, said his company doesn't need the final year of a five-year tariff aimed at big Japanese motorcycles, and he asked the International Trade Commission to cancel it. 

   The move brought immediate praise from Congress and gave a boost to controversial efforts to aid other battered domestic industries with trade legislation. 
Mr. Beals's offer to drop the tariff early "is the kind of attitude in American business that we need," says an aide to Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania, a Republican who backed Harley's efforts to get the tariff in 1983. 
Harley's move shows that a tariff can be a short-term tonic to a company, Sen. Heinz feels, and needn't become a permanent lifeline, as opponents to such measures have warned. 

   But the 59-year-old Mr. Beals didn't bring his company back from the brink of collapse by giving away competitive advantages, nor is he doing so now. 
His plea to terminate the tariff is more intended to portray Harley as a Chrysler Corp. on two wheels. 

   Mr. Beals concedes that the tariff, which falls to 10% from 15% April 1, is at this point worth little or nothing to Harley, the only remaining U.S. motorcycle maker. 
And some say it was never essential to Harley's survival. 
"I think they could have pulled it off without the tariff," says Kevin Bahr, a securities analyst who follows Harley at Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. in Milwaukee. 

   Rather, Mr. Bahr says, it was Harley's streamlining of its manufacturing process and improvement of quality that saved the company. 
Some of the measures, such as so-called just-in-time inventory control, are patterned after Japanese industrial practices. 

   Though Mr. Beals was saying in Washington that the tariff had given Harley a "respite from predatory import practices," the company noted in its stock offering last summer that "the benefits . . . from the special tariff have been limited." 

   A spokeswoman at the trade agency said yesterday that Harley hasn't yet filed its request to cancel the tariff and that, when it does, the agency will need at least three months to research the request and then make a recommendation to President Reagan. 

   Mr. Beals says that making such a request has been under consideration for several months, but that he wanted to wait until just before the tariff levels were lowered to 10%, when the tariff won't be "worth a whole bunch." 

   Mr. Beals, himself an avid rider of Harley's big Electra Glide, or "hog" cycles, led a management buyout of Harley from its then-parent, AMF Inc., in 1981. 
Almost immediately, high interest rates, a soft market for big cycles and a global war for market share among the much bigger Japanese motorcycle brands, Honda and Yamaha, threatened to send Harley to the junkyard. 

   The two Japanese makers were rapidly introducing new models and cutting prices. 
Their U.S. inventories were bulging, threatening still more price cuts. 
"When the elephants dance, the ants get trampled," Mr. Beals says. 
Harley also was still dogged by a 1970s reputation for uneven workmanship. 

   President Reagan granted the company tariffs on imported cycles with engines of 700 cubic centimeters or bigger, known as heavyweight cycles, beginning at 45% of wholesale prices and falling year by year to 35%, 20%, 15%, 10%, and ending in April 1988. 

   But, Mr. Beals notes, that was easily skirted. 
Japanese makers quickly began building so-called "tariff busters" -- cycles with engines between 690 and 699 cubic centimeters. 
And the glut of Japanese cycles already in the country wasn't affected. 
"I'd bet my net worth," Mr. Beals says, that some Japanese dealers are still selling "new" cycles that were imported before the tariff. 

   As a result of the improved manufacturing techniques he installed at Harley, Mr. Beals's net worth is now considerable. 
His 15.9% stake in Harley's almost six million shares, which went public last summer, had a value of about $12 million at yesterday's closing price of $13.50, up 25 cents, in American Stock Exchange composite trading. 

   Mr. Bahr says that's a rich price -- almost 16 times 1986 operating earnings of 82 cents a share, or $4.3 million -- for a company in a mature industry, but adds that "there is still kind of a mystique -- the only motorcycle company in America." 
Sales last year were $295.3 million and market share rose to about 19% from a 1983 low of 12.5%, Mr. Beals says. 

   Mr. Beals monitors quality by doing his business travel, weather permitting, on a "hog." 
On a recent trip from San Francisco to Denver with his wife, Eleanor, he discovered a defect in the 1986-model seat: the rear, or passenger, seat tilted forward and Mrs. Beals's helmet kept bumping his whenever he hit the brakes. 
They stopped in Reno, Nev., to call the factory, but test riders there had already found the flaw.

   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., citing concerns about Bethlehem Steel Corp.'s survival, downgraded its ratings on $761 million of the steelmaker's debt. 

   The rating concern downgraded Bethlehem's senior debt to triple-C-plus from single-B-minus and its subordinated debt to triple-C-minus from triple-C. 
S&amp;P affirmed its single-C rating on Bethlehem preferred stock. 
Dividends on the stock were suspended last year. 

   The actions reflect "concern for Bethlehem's viability over the intermediate term, rather than any immediate threat to solvency," S&amp;P said. 

   In light of Bethlehem's "weak financial condition, the firm's ability to weather any substantial price competition or a general economic downturn is questionable," S&amp;P said. 

   Choosing bankruptcy, "which relieved some of Bethlehem's competitors of their financial burdens," is still an alternative for the company "in the absence of any visible exit from the industry's morass," the rating concern said. 

   The steelmaker's liquidity, though, is strong relative to requirements this year, S&amp;P said. 
Bethlehem's cash position improved to $463 million at year's end from $395 million Sept. 30 and $99 million at the end of 1985. 

   But Bethlehem has raised its cash reserves through non-sustainable actions such as selling assets, reducing working capital and drawing on bank credit facilities, rather than from operations, S&amp;P said. 

   A Bethlehem spokesman termed the downgrading "inappropriate" in light of the company's "stability" in the market, "realization of the anticipated improvements in our steel operations" and the current liquidity level. 
Bethlehem expects to maintain ample liquidity through this year, the spokesman said.

Bancorp Requests
Addition to Shares

   First Interstate Bancorp, which last month dropped a takeover bid for BankAmerica Corp., asked shareholders to approve measures that would facilitate future acquisitions as well as discourage a hostile takeover of itself. 

   Separately, the company said in a regulatory filing that it was "premature" to decide whether it would have to reclassify any of its $504 million in Brazilian debt as non-accruing, following that nation's recent suspension of payments on its foreign debt. 
First Interstate said if the loans were reclassified that it would reduce 1987 income before taxes by about $33.5 million. 
The company had 1986 net income of $337.9 million, or $7.19 a share. 

   In the proxy statement for its April 24 annual meeting, First Interstate asked shareholders to approve an increase in authorized common shares to 250 million from 100 million. 
The bank holding company said the increased number of shares could be used for acquisitions or other unspecified "investment opportunities." 
It indicated that it currently doesn't have any plans for issuing newly authorized common as part of a takeover. 
Other possible uses, it said, were for future financings, stock splits or dividends, and employee benefit plans. 

   First Interstate also said the jump in authorized shares would enable it to discourage a hostile takeover by issuing warrants or rights to purchase added shares. 
But it said it wasn't aware of any effort to seek control, and that it doesn't currently plan to use the shares as a takeover defense. 

   While abandoning its unsolicited $3.23 billion takeover offer for San Francisco-based BankAmerica, First Interstate has indicated continued interest in expanding outside its current 12-state territory, possibly into Texas. 
Several large California banks are changing their charters to give them more clout in dealing with unsolicited overtures, reflecting a recent change in California law to allow New York banks to make acquisitions in the state beginning in 1991. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, First Interstate shares closed at $59.25, up 12.5 cents. 

   In addition, First Interstate disclosed that Charles W. Parry, chairman of Aluminum Co. of America, and L.S. Skaggs, chairman of American Stores Co., recently resigned as directors. 
It said Mr. Skaggs would remain on the company's Utah bank board, but didn't give a reason for Mr. Parry's resignation. 
It also said Bruce Nordstrom, co-chairman of Nordstrom Inc., didn't seek reelection for personal reasons. 
Ralph Davidson, Time Inc.'s executive committee chairman, was nominated to the board, leaving it with 14 members. 

   Reflecting a recent change in Delaware law, First Interstate also proposed to limit director liability for damages in cases of negligent or grossly negligent behavior.

   A self-assured President Reagan vigorously defended his decision to sell arms to Iran, but said he "would not go down that same road again." 

   In his first news conference in four months, Mr. Reagan last night appeared to do what his aides had said he had to do: He confidently fielded a barrage of questions about his secret Iran and Nicaragua policies and remained in command of the half-hour session. 

   The president again denied knowing that profits from the Iran arms sales were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels, or Contras. 
Asked whether he knew White House aides were directing private aid to the Contras, he acknowledged only that he knew private individuals and groups were aiding the insurgents after Congress cut off U.S. aid to them in 1984. 
"I don't believe it was counter to any law," Mr. Reagan said. 

   The president's performance was in sharp contrast to his previous news conference Nov. 19, during which he appeared defensive and unfamiliar with the details of his own Iran policy. 
During that earlier session, Mr. Reagan repeatedly denied that the U.S. had condoned Israeli arms sales to Iran in 1985, but aides issued a correction minutes after the news conference ended. 
Last night, Mr. Reagan said that he simply had misspoken and that he immediately had directed his aides to set the record straight. 

   Asked why he initially told reporters there was "no foundation" to a report that the U.S. had secretly sold arms to Iran, the president said he was trying to save the lives of the American hostages in Lebanon and Iranian middlemen whom he believed were helping to free them. 
At the time, Mr. Reagan said, he believed two more hostages were about to be released. 

   "I'm not going to tell falsehoods to the American people," he said. 
"I'll leave that to others." 

   On several occasions, however, the president appeared to contradict both Vice President George Bush and his own commission that investigated the Iran-Contra affair. 

   Asked whether Mr. Bush had advised against the Iran policy, Mr. Reagan said, "No." 
Mr. Bush, on a campaign trip to Michigan last month, told reporters that he had "expressed reservations" about the Iran arms policy to "key players" in the administration. 

   Mr. Bush's press secretary Steve Hart last night said the president's statement didn't contradict Mr. Bush's February comments. 
Mr. Hart pointed out that Mr. Bush has said on several occasions that he supported the Iran policy. 
Mr. Hart wouldn't comment on how that support, or the president's comments, squared with the "reservations" Mr. Bush has said he expressed. 

   Although the commission, headed by former Sen. John Tower (R., Texas), reported that the Iranians had paid far more than market value for U.S. TOW anti-tank missiles, Mr. Reagan said the U.S. "asked for $12 million, which was the cost -- no profit -- on those weapons." 

   The Tower Commission also reported that former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane testified that Mr. Reagan had given advance approval for Israeli arms sales to Iran in an August 1985 telephone call. 
Last night, Mr. Reagan said he didn't think he'd approved the sales in a phone call. 
Erroneously recalling Mr. McFarlane's testimony, Mr. Reagan last night said his former aide had testified that the approval was given during a meeting at Bethesda Naval Hospital, following the president's colon cancer surgery in July 1985. 

   The Tower Commission also reported that the president changed his account of whether he approved the Israeli sales in advance, first saying he did and later saying he didn't recall doing so. 
Last night, Mr. Reagan said he did approve the sales, but couldn't remember when. 

   But when he was asked whether he also could have forgotten that he was told funds from the Iran arms sales were being diverted to the Contras, he replied: "Oh no. 
You would have heard me from -- without opening the door to the office -- if I had been told that at any time. 
No. 
And I still do not have the answer to that money." 

   The president declined to say whether he thought former National Security Adviser John Poindexter and former National Security Council aide Oliver North had deceived him by secretly funneling military aid to the Contras. 
"I don't know . . . 
I want to get to the bottom of this and find out all that has happened," he said. 

   But he defended his hands-off management, which the Tower board criticized. 
"I think that most people in business would agree that it is a proper management style," Mr. Reagan said. 
"You get the best people you can to do a job. 
Then you don't hang over their shoulder. . . . 
The only time you move is if there's incontrovertible evidence that they are not following policy, or they have gone down a road where they are not achieving what we want." 

   Earlier yesterday, it was disclosed that shortly before he tried to commit suicide last month, Mr. McFarlane wrote letters to his lawyer, Leonard Garment, and to three lawmakers, asserting that the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the U.S. secretly offered to give $1 million a month to the Nicaraguan rebels in 1984. 

   Mr. McFarlane revealed the offer, but not who made it, in written testimony last month to the Tower Commission, which told of the offer in its report. 
Bank records made public this month by Contra leader Adolfo Calero show the insurgents received $1 million a month from a Swiss bank account between July 6, 1984, and Feb. 7, 1985, and a further $24 million between Feb. 27 and March 25, 1985. 

   Saudi Ambassador Bandar bin Sultan has denied that he or any other Saudi has offered aid to the Contras. 
The existence of the letters was disclosed yesterday in the Washington Post and confirmed by Mr. Garment.
