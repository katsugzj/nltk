<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2>

This final rule is issued under Marketing Order 907 [7 CFR Part 907], as
amended, regulating the handling of navel oranges grown in Arizona and
designated part of California. This order is effective under the Agricultural
Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended, hereinafter referred to as
the Act.

This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and Departmental
Regulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a ``non-major'' rule under
criteria contained therein.

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),
the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered
the economic impact of the use of volume regulations on small entities
as well as larger ones.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business
subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly
or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the
Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about
through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own
behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.

There are approximately 125 handlers of California-Arizona navel oranges
subject to regulation under the navel orange marketing order, and approximately
4,065 producers in California and Arizona. Small agricultural producers
have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.2] as
those having annual gross revenues for the last three years of less than
$500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose
gross annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of handlers
and producers of California-Arizona navel oranges may be classified as
small entities.

This action is consistent with the marketing policy for 1988-89 adopted
by the Navel Orange Administrative Committee (Committee). The Committee
met publicly on December 28, 1988, in Visalia, California, to consider
the current and prospective conditions of supply and demand and recommended,
by a ten to one vote, a quantity of navel oranges deemed advisable to be
handled during the specified week. The Committee reports that demand for
113's has improved.

Based on consideration of supply and market conditions, and the evaluation
of alternatives to the implementation of prorate regulations, the Administrator
of the AMS has determined that this final rule will not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is further found that it is impracticable,
unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice
and engage in further public procedure with respect to this action and
that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action
until 30 days after publication in the 
<T4>Federal Register </T4>because of insufficient time between the date
when information became available upon which this regulation is based and
the effective date necessary to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.
Interested persons were given an opportunity to submit information and
views on the regulation at an open meeting. To effectuate the declared
purposes of the Act, it is necessary to make this regulatory provision
effective as specified, and handlers have been apprised of such provision
and the effective time.

<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>This final rule has been reviewed under
Executive Order 12291 and Departmental Regulation 1512-1 and has been determined
to be a ``non-major'' rule under criteria contained therein.

Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),
the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has determined
that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities.

The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory action to the scale of business
subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly
or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the
Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, and rules issued thereunder, are
unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially
small entity orientation and compatibility.

There are approximately 85 handlers of lemons grown in California and Arizona
subject to regulation under the lemon marketing order and approximately
2500 producers in the regulated area. Small agricultural producers have
been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.2] as those
having annual gross revenues for the last three years of less than $500,000,
and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose gross annual
receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of handlers and producers
of California-Arizona lemons may be classified as small entities.

This regulation is issued under Marketing Order No. 910, as amended [7
CFR Part 910] regulating the handling of lemons grown in California and
Arizona. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement
Act (the ``Act,'' 7 U.S.C. 601-674), as amended. This action is based upon
the recommendation and information submitted by the Lemon Administrative
Committee (Committee) and upon other available information. It is found
that this action will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.

This regulation is consistent with the marketing policy for 1988-89. The
Committee met publicly on December 28, 1988, in Los Angeles, California,
to consider the current and prospective conditions of supply and demand
and unanimously recommended a quantity of lemons deemed available to be
handled during the specified week. The Committee reports that demand for
lemons is good.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is further found that it is impracticable,
unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice
and engage in further public procedure with respect to this action and
that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action
until 30 days after publication in the 
<T4>Federal Register </T4>because of insufficient time between the date
when information became available upon which this regulation is based and
the effective date necessary to effectuate the declared purposes of the
Act. Interested persons were given an opportunity to submit information
and views on the regulation at an open meeting. It is necessary, in order
to effectuate the declared purposes of the Act, to make these regulatory
provisions effective as specified, and handlers have been apprised of such
provisions and the effective time.

<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2>

<ITAG tagnum=84>Classification</ITAG>

This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures established in Departmental
Regulation 1512-1, which implements Executive Order 12291 and has been
determined to be non-major. This action will not result in an annual effect
on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or prices
for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government
agencies or geographic regions; or significant adverse effects on competition,
employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of
United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises
in domestic or export markets.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Environmental Impact Statement</ITAG>

This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR Part 1940 Subpart
G, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that the
proposed action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly
affecting the quality of the human environment, and in accordance with
the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91-190, an Environmental
Impact Statement is not required.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Intergovernmental Review</ITAG>

This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under
number 10.422, and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372
which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.
(7 CFR Part 3105, Subpart V; 48 FR 29112, June 24, 1983; 49 FR 2267, May
31, 1984; 50 FR 14088, April 10, 1985).

<ITAG tagnum=84>Discussion of Interim Rule</ITAG>

It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property,
loans, grants, benefits or contracts shall be published for comment notwithstanding
the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. However, FmHA
is making this action effective immediately upon publication in the
<T4> Federal Register </T4>without securing prior public comment. The purpose
of this rule is to provide assistance to businesses which have been distressed
by natural disasters that have occurred in 1988.

Especially as a result of drought across most of the country, an emergency
situation exists. This interim rule is a response to an existing situation
and, while this Department is reluctant to short circuit prior public comment,
it is certain that failure to implement a mandated program at once will
result in significant economic harm to the public.

FmHA believes it is essential that this assistance be made available as
soon as possible before it is too late for the businesses to recover. The
typical drought-impacted business in rural communities was, going in to
the 1988 season, only beginning to recover from the serious agricultural
and other physical and economic problems of the preceding decade. Forbearing
creditors, aware that any business depends on its customers' economic health,
can forbear just so long. Rural businesses and their creditors must plan
for the immediate economic future. Without immediate implementation of
programs of financial assistance, there is no reason to assume the creditors
of rural businesses devastated by the blow to the agricultural and other
rural business sectors will_or can_continue to forbear.

The Disaster Assistance Act of 1988, moreover, states ``(1) the disasterous
drought of 1988 is adversely affecting a large number of States, with serious
economic consequences for family farmers; (2) the harm caused by the drought
is not limited to farmers, but extends to each rural community whose economic
viability is being devastated; (3) rural businesses and financial institutions
are already experiencing the negative effects of decreased sales, and they
anticipate severe problems over the next year, due to crop failures and
the unavailability of credit * * *.''

Likewise, the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Conference Committee in
reporting HR-5015 (now Pub. L. 100-387) is emphatic in treating programs
under the Act as emergency matters, and states ``the conferees expect the
Secretary of Agriculture to carry out the provisions of this bill in as
efficient and straightforward manner as possible. Paperwork should be simplified
and procedures to receive assistance should be expedited.'' The Department
is now finalizing regulations streamlining the B&amp;I program and this
rule further eases requirements applicable to disaster assistance loan
guarantees to be processed under the B&amp;I program. The Secretary means
to get this assistance in place now to minimize the human and financial
tragedy that is the aftermath of the drought and other natural disasters
of 1988.

The Department is well aware that an emergency exists because of the natural
disasters of 1988. Rapid delivery of economic assistance is essential.
A major study by the Chamber of Commerce of the United States in 1985 is
helpful in assessing the impact of rural industrial jobs. That study dealt
with job creation within a community and concluded that 100 new industrial
jobs support 351 people and increase personal incomes by $1,030,000. An
added 97 households depend on those 100 jobs, as do $600,000 in retail
sales. Those sales would support one additional retailer and 68 retail
jobs. Making credit available promptly for drought-impacted rural businesses
and industries is, therefore, of importance.

Public comments will be accepted for 60 days and later revisions will be
made to this interim rule if justified on the basis of comments received.
This procedure will make assistance available now. The usual course of
a proposed rule, comment period, comment analysis, and a final rule incorporating
changes would inevitably mean a 60 to 90 day delay in getting assistance
where it is most needed. Those seeking to comment and make suggestions
for improvement should be advised that final action will occur as promptly
as possible after the 60 day comment period.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Discussion of the Rule</ITAG>

FmHA is implementing section 331 of the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988
by adding an appendix for this new program at the end of its Business and
Industry loan program. The loan guarantees authorized and implemented by
this action will be called Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loans. These
loans will be available to generally the same type of entities as Business
and Industry loans for generally the same type of loan purposes as Business
and Industry loans, through generally the same type of lenders. The major
differences between Drought and Disaster loans and Business and Industry
loans are as follows:

(1) Drought and Disaster loans must assist in alleviating financial distress
caused to rural business entities by drought, hail, excessive moisture,
or related conditions in 1988 or assist such entities which refinance or
restructure debt as the result of losses incurred because of such natural
disasters.

(2) Drought and Disaster loans for refinancing may allow an existing lender
to bring that part of its existing unguaranteed debt that has been adversely
affected by a disaster under the new guarantee. In no case will the guarantee
exceed 90 percent of loan principal.

(3) The maximum amount of Drought and Disaster loans to any one borrower
is $500,000.

(4) The requirement for borrower's equity contribution to the business
may be somewhat smaller for a Drought and Disaster guaranteed loan than
for a Business and Industry loan, although that equity must be positive
and must be such that when considered with other credit factors, repayment
of the loan and continued success of the business operation are reasonably
assured.

(5) The guarantee on a Drought and Disaster loan will cover principal only
and will not cover interest or protective advances.

Generally, except where the Disaster Assistance Act mandates otherwise,
FmHA has sought to minimize differences between these loans and Business
and Industry loans so that field staff, lenders, and others already familiar
with B&amp;I guaranteed loans will be able to handle these loans without
any significant training or research. This will expedite the provision
of needed assistance.

authorized by section 331 (``Disaster Assistance for Rural Business Enterprises'')
of the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988, which provides for guarantees of

hail, excessive moisture, or related conditions occurring in 1988, or to
assist such entities that refinance or restructure debt as a result of
losses incurred, directly or indirectly, because of such natural disasters.
Where used in this appendix, the term ``natural disaster(s)'' refers only
to drought, hail, excessive moisture, and related conditions occurring
in 1988. All provisions of Subparts A and E of Part 1980 of this chapter
apply to D&amp;D loans, except as provided in this appendix. All forms
used in connection with a D&amp;D loan will be those used in connection

<ITAG tagnum=77>_</ITAG>
<ITAG tagnum=77>_</ITAG>
<ITAG tagnum=20>The United States of America, acting through Farmers Home Administration
(FmHA) has entered into a Loan Note Guarantee_Drought and Disaster Guaranteed
Loans (Loan Note Guarantee)'' (Form FmHA 1980-69) or has issued a ``Conditional
Commitment for Guarantee'' (Form FmHA 449-14) to enter into a Loan Note
Guarantee with the Lender applicable to such loan to participate in a percentage
of any loss on the loan not to exceed ___% of the amount of the principal
advance and any interest (including any loan subsidy) thereon. The terms
of the Loan Note Guarantee are controlling. In order to facilitate the
marketability of the guaranteed portion of the loan and as a condition
for obtaining a guarantee of the loan(s), the Lender enters into this agreement.
The maximum loss guaranteed is governed by 7 CFR Part 1980 Subpart E Appendix
I and the Loan Note Guarantee (Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loans)</ITAG>
<ITAG tagnum=21>The Parties Agree:</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>I. The maximum loss covered under the Loan Note Guarantee will not
exceed ___ percent of the principal (Maximum $___).</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>II. Full Faith and Credit. The Loan Note Guarantee constitutes an
obligation supported by the full faith and credit of the United States
and is incontestable except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the
Lender has actual knowledge at the time it became such Lender or which
Lender participates in or condones. Any note which provides for the payment
of interest on interest shall not be guaranteed. Any Loan Note Guarantee
or Assignment Guarantee Agreement Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loan
(Assignment Guarantee Agreement) attached to or relating to a note which
provides for payment of interest on interest is void.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>The Loan Note Guarantee will be unenforceable by the Lender to the
extent any loss is occasioned by violation of usury laws, negligent servicing,
or failure to obtain the required security regardless of the time at which
FmHA acquires knowledge of the foregoing. Any losses will be unenforceable
by the Lender to the extent that loan funds are used for purposes other
than those specifically approved by FmHA in its Conditional Commitment
for Guarantee. Negligent servicing is defined as the failure to perform
those services which a reasonably prudent Lender would perform in servicing
its own portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed. The term includes not
only the concept of failure to act but also not acting in a timely manner
or acting in a manner contrary to the manner in which a reasonably prudent
lender would act up to the time of loan maturity or until a final loss
is paid.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>III. Lender's Sale or Assignment of Guaranteed Loan. A. The Lender
may retain all of the guaranteed loan. The Lender is not permitted to sell
or participate any amount of the guaranteed or unguaranteed portion(s)

parent, subsidiary or affiliate. If the Lender desires to market all or
part of the guaranteed portion of the loan at or subsequent to loan closing,
such loan must not be in default as set forth in the terms of the notes.
The Lender may proceed under the following options:</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>1. 
<T3>Assignment. </T3>Assign all or part of the guaranteed portion of the
loan to one or more Holders by using Form FmHA 1980-70, ``Assignment Guarantee
Agreement_Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loan.'' Holder(s), upon written
notice to Lender and FmHA, may reassign the unpaid guaranteed portion of
the loan sold thereunder. Upon such notification the assignee shall succeed
to all rights and obligations of the Holder(s) therunder. If this portion
is selected, the Lender may not at a later date cause to be issued any
additional notes.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>2. 
<T3>Multi-Note System. </T3>When this option is selected by the Lender,
upon disposition the Holder will receive one of the Borrower's executed
notes and Form FmHA 1980-69, ``Loan Note Guarantee_Drought and Disaster
Guaranteed Loan'' attached to the Borrower's note. However, all rights
under the security instruments (including personal and/or corporate guarantees)
will remain with the Lender and in all cases inure to its and the Government's
benefit notwithstanding any contrary provisions of state law.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>a. 
<T3>At Loan Closing: </T3>Provide for no more than 10 notes, unless the
Borrower and FmHA agree otherwise, for the guaranteed portion and one note

provided:</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>(a) The Borrower agrees and executes the new notes.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>(b) The interest rate does not exceed the interest rate in effect

to such reissue of notes.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>(e) There is adequate collateral securing the note(s).</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>(f) No intervening liens have arisen or have been perfected and the
secured lien priority remains the same.</ITAG>

Loan which will be cancelled by FmHA.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>3. 
<T3>Participations. </T3>a. The Lender may obtain participation in its
loan under its normal operating procedures. Participation means a sale
of an interest in the loan wherein the Lender retains the note, collateral
securing the note, and all responsibility for loan servicing and liquidation.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>b. The Lender is required to hold in its portfolio or retain a minimum
of 5 percent of the total guaranteed loan(s) amount. The amount required
to be retained must be of the unguaranteed portion of the loan and cannot
be participated to another. The Lender may sell the remaining amount of
the unguaranteed portion of the loan only through participation. However,
the Lender will always retain the responsibility for loan servicing and
liquidation.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>B. When a guaranteed portion of a loan is sold by the Lender to a
Holder(s), the Holder(s) shall thereupon succeed to all rights of Lender
under the Loan Note Guarantee_Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loan to the
extent of the portion of loan purchased. Lender will remain bound to all
the obligations under the Loan Note Guarantee_Drought and Disaster Guaranteed
Loan, and this agreement, and the FmHA program regulations found in the
applicable Subpart of Title 7 CFR Part 1980, and to future FmHA program
regulations not inconsistent with the express provisions hereof.</ITAG>

remain mortgagee and/or secured party of record, not withstanding the fact
that another may hold a portion of the loan. The entire loan will be secured
by the same security with equal lien priority for the guaranteed and unguaranteed
portions of the loan. Lender may charge Holder a servicing fee. The unguaranteed
portion of a loan will not be paid first nor given any preference or priority
over the guaranteed portion of the loan.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>B. Disposition of the guaranteed portion of a loan may be made prior
to full disbursement, completion of construction and acquisitions only

will include in its demand the amount of unpaid principal, due (no capitalized
interest).</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>The Holder will also inform FmHA of the amount of past interest and
capitalized interest it is owed. Such interest is not guaranteed. The Holder(s)
remain entitled to all interest due up to the point of repurchase by the
Lender or purchase by FmHA from the Holder(s) if such interest is or can
be collected. If FmHA has purchased, FmHA is equally entitled.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>The FmHA office serving the Borrower will promptly notify the Lender
of the Holder(s) demand for payment. The Lender will promptly provide the
FmHA office servicing the Borrower with the information necessary for FmHA's
determination of the appropriate amount due the Holder(s). Any discrepancy
between the amount claimed by the Holder(s) and the information submitted
by the Lender must be resolved before payment will be approved. FmHA will
notify both parties who must resolve the conflict before payment by FmHA
will be approved. Such a conflict will suspend the running of the 30 day
payment requirement. Upon receipt of the appropriate information, the FmHA
office servicing the Borrower will review the demand and submit it to the
State Director for verification. After reviewing the demand, the State
Director will transmit the request to the FmHA Finance Office for issuance
of the appropriate check. Upon issuance, the Finance Office will notify
the office serving the Borrower and State Director and remit the check(s)
to the Holder(s).</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>E. Lender consents to the purchase by FmHA and agrees to furnish on
request by FmHA a current statement certified by an appropriate authorized
officer of the Lender of the unpaid principal and interest then owed by
the Borrower on the loan and the amount due to the Holder(s). Lender agrees
that any purchase by FmHA does not change, alter or modify any of the Lender's
obligations to FmHA arising from said loan or guarantee, nor does such
purchase waive any of FmHA's rights against Lender, and FmHA will have
the right to set-off against Lender all rights inuring to FmHA from the
Holder against FmHA's obligation to Lender under the Loan Note Guarantee.
To the extent FmHA holds a portion of a loan, loan subsidy will not be
paid the Lender.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>F. Servicing fees assessed by the Lender to a Holder are collectible
only from payment installments received by the Lender from the Borrower.
When FmHA repurchases from a Holder, FmHA will pay the Holder only the
amounts due the Holder. FmHA will not reimburse the Lender for servicing
fees assessed to a Holder and not collected from payments received from
the Borrower. No servicing fee shall be charged FmHA and no such fee is
collectible from FmHA.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>G. Lender may also repurchase the guaranteed portion of the loan consistent
with paragraph 10 of the Loan Note Guarantee.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>XI. Liquidation. If the Lender concludes that liquidation of a guaranteed
loan account is necessary because of one or more defaults or third party
actions that the Borrower cannot or will not cure or eliminate within a
reasonable period of time, a meeting will be arranged by the Lender with
FmHA. When FmHA concurs with the Lender's conclusion or at any time concludes
independently that liquidation is necessary, it will notify the Lender
and the matter will be handled as follows:</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>The Lender will liquidate the loan unless FmHA, at its option, decides
to carry out liquidation.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>When the decision to liquidate is made, the Lender may proceed to
purchase from Holder(s) the guaranteed portion of the loan. The Holder(s)
will be paid according to the provision in the Loan Note Guarantee or the
Assignment Guarantee Agreement.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>If the Lender does not purchase the guaranteed portion of the loan,
FmHA will be notified immediately in writing. FmHA will then purchase the
guaranteed portion of the loan from the Holder(s). If FmHA holds any of
the guaranteed portion, FmHA will be paid first its pro rata share of the
proceeds from liquidation of the collateral.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>A. 
<T3> Lender's proposed method of liquidation.</T3> Within 30 days after
the decision to liquidate, the Lender will advise FmHA in writing of its
proposed detailed method of liquidation called a liquidation plan and will
provide FmHA with:</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>1. Such proof as FmHA requires to establish the Lender's ownership
of the guaranteed loan promissory note(s) and related security instruments.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>2. Information lists concerning the Borrower's assets including real
and personal property, fixtures, claims, contracts, inventory (including
perishables), accounts receivable, personal and corporate guarantees, and
other existing and contingent assets, advice as to whether or not each
item is serving as collateral for the guaranteed loan.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>3. A proposed method of making the maximum collection possible on
the indebtedness.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>4. If the outstanding loan balance including accrued interest is less
than $200,000, the Lender will obtain an estimate of the market and potential
liquidated value of the collateral. On loan balances in excess of $200,000,
the Lender will obtain an independent appraisal report on all collateral
securing the loan, which will reflect the current market value and potential
liquidation value. The appraisal report is for the purpose of permitting
the Lender and FmHA to determine the appropriate liquidation actions. Any
independent appraiser's fee will be shared equally by FmHA and the Lender.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>B. 
<T3> FmHA's response to Lender's liquidation plan.</T3> FmHA will inform
the Lender in writing whether it concurs in the Lender's liquidation plan
within 30 days after receipt of such notification from the Lender. If FmHA
needs additional time to respond to the liquidation plan, it will advise
the Lender of a definite time for such response. Should FmHA and the Lender
not agree on the Lender's liquidation plan, negotiations will take place
between FmHA and the Lender to resolve the disagreement. The Lender will
ordinarily conduct the liquidation; however, should FmHA opt to conduct
the liquidation, FmHA will proceed as follows:</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>1. The Lender will transfer to FmHA all rights and interests necessary
to allow FmHA to liquidate the loan. In this event, the Lender will not
be paid for any loss until after the collateral is liquidated and the final
loss is determined by FmHA.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>2. FmHA will attempt to obtain the maximum amount of proceeds from
liquidation.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>3. Options available to FmHA include any one or combination of the
usual commercial methods of liquidation.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>C. 
<T3>Acceleration.</T3> The Lender or FmHA, if it liquidates, will proceed
as expeditiously as possible when acceleration of the indebtedness is necessary
including giving any notices and taking any other legal actions required
by the security instruments. A copy of the acceleration notice or other
acceleration document will be sent to FmHA or the Lender, as the case may
be.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>D. 
<T3>Liquidation: </T3>Accounting and Reports. When the Lender conducts
the liquidation, it will account for funds during the period of liquidation
and will provide FmHA with periodic reports on the progress of liquidation,
disposition of collateral, resulting costs and additional procedures necessary
for successful completion of liquidation. The Lender will transmit to FmHA
any payments received from the Borrower and/or pro rata share of liquidation
or other proceeds, etc. when FmHA is the holder of a portion of the guaranteed
loan using Form FmHA 1980-43, ``Lender's Guaranteed Loan Payment to FmHA.''
When FmHA liquidates, the Lender will be provided with similar reports
on request.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>E. 
<T3>Determination of Loss and Payment.</T3> In all liquidation cases, final
settlement will be made with the Lender after the collateral is liquidated.
FmHA will have the right to recover losses paid under the guarantee from
any party liable.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>1. Form FmHA 449-30, ``Loan Note Guarantee Report of Loss,'' will
be used for calculations of all estimated and final loss determinations.
Estimated loss payments may be approved by FmHA after the Lender has submitted
a liquidation plan approved by FmHA. Payment will be made in accordance
with applicable FmHA regulations.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>2. When the Lender is conducting the liquidation, and owns any of
the guaranteed portion of the loan, it may request a tentative loss estimate
by submitting to FmHA an estimate of the loss that will occur in connection
with liquidation of the loan. FmHA will agree to pay an estimated loss
settlement to the Lender provided the Lender applies such amount due to
the outstanding principal balance owed on the guaranteed debt. Such estimate
will be prepared and submitted by the Lender on Form FmHA 449-30, using
the basic formula as provided on the report except that the appraisal value
will be used in lieu of the amount received from the sale of collateral.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>After the Report of Loss estimate has been approved by FmHA, and within
30 days thereafter, FmHA will send the original Report of Loss estimate
to FmHA Finance Office for issuance of a Treasury check in payment of the
estimated amount due the Lender.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>After liquidation has been completed, a final loss report will be
submitted on Form FmHA 449-30 by the Lender to FmHA.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>3. After the Lender has completed liquidation, FmHA upon receipt of
the final accounting and report of loss, may audit and will determine the
actual loss. If FmHA has any questions regarding the amounts set forth
in the final Report of Loss, it will investigate the matter. The Lender
will make its records available to and otherwise assist FmHA in making
the investigation. If FmHA finds any discrepancies, it will contact the
Lender and arrange for the necessary corrections to be made as soon as
possible. When FmHA finds the final Report of Loss to be proper in all
respects, it will be tentatively approved in the space provided on the
form for that purpose.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>4. When the Lender has conducted liquidation and after the final Report
of Loss has been tentatively approved:</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>a. If the loss is greater than the estimated loss payment, FmHA will
send the original of the final Report of Loss to the Finance Office for
issuance of a Treasury check in payment of the additional amount owed by
FmHA to the Lender.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>b. If the loss is less than the estimated loss, the Lender will reimburse
FmHA for the overpayment plus interest at the note rate from date of payment.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>5. If FmHA has conducted liquidation, it will provide an accounting
and Report of Loss to the Lender and will pay the Lender in accordance
with the Loan Note Guarantee.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>F. 
<T3>Maximum amount of interest loss payment. </T3>Interest is not covered
by the guarantee.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>G. 
<T3>Application of FmHA loss payment. </T3>The estimated loss payment shall
be applied as of the date of such payment. The total amount of the loss
payment remitted by FmHA will be applied by the Lender on the guaranteed
portion of the loan debt. However, such application does not release the
Borrower from liability. At time of final loss settlement the Lender will
notify the Borrower that the loss payment has been so applied. In all cases
a final Form FmHA 449-30 prepared and submitted by the Lender must be processed
by FmHA in order to close out the files at the FmHA Finance Office.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>H. 
<T3>Income from collateral. </T3>Any net rental or other income that has
been received by the Lender from the collateral will be applied on the
guaranteed loan debt.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>I. 
<T3>Liquidation costs. </T3>Certain reasonable liquidation costs will be
allowed during the liquidation process. These liquidation costs will be
submitted as a part of the liquidation plan. Such costs will be deducted
from gross proceeds from the disposition of collateral unless the costs
have been previously determined by the Lender (with FmHA written concurrence)
to be protective advances. If changed circumstances after submission of
the liquidation plan require a revision of liquidation costs, the Lender
will procure FmHA's written concurrence prior to proceeding with the proposed
changes. No in-house expenses of the Lender will be allowed. In-house expenses
include, but are not limited to, employees' salaries, staff lawyers, travel
and overhead.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>J. 
<T3>Foreclosure. </T3>The parties owning the guaranteed portion and unguaranteed
portions of the loan will join to institute foreclosure action or, in lieu
of foreclosure, to take a deed of conveyance to such parties. When the
conveyance is received and liquidated, net proceeds will be applied to
the guaranteed loan debt.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>K. 
<T3>Payment. </T3>Such loss will be paid by FmHA within 60 days after the
review of the accounting of the collateral.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>XII. Protective Advances. Protective advances will not be covered
by the guarantee.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>XIII. Additional Loans or Advances. The Lender will not make additional
expenditures or new loans without first obtaining the written approval
of FmHA even though such expenditures or loans will not be guaranteed.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>XIV. Future Recovery. After a loan has been liquidated and a final
loss has been paid by FmHA, any future funds which may be recovered by
the Lender, will be pro-rated between FmHA and the Lender. FmHA will be
paid such amount recovered in proportion to the percentage it guaranteed
for the loan and the Lender will retain such amounts in proportion to the
percentage of the unguaranteed portion of the loan.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>XV. Transfer and Assumption Cases. Refer to the applicable Subpart
of Title 7 of CFR Part 1980.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>If a loss should occur upon consummation of a complete transfer and
assumption for less than the full amount of the debt and the transferor-debtor
(including personal guarantees) is released from personal liability, the
Lender, if it holds the guarantee portion, may file an estimated Report
of Loss on Form FmHA 449-30, ``Loan Note Guarantee Report of Loss,'' to
recover its pro rata share of the actual loss at that time. In completing
Form FmHA 449-30, the amount of the debt assumed will be entered on line
24 as Net Collateral (Recovery).</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>XVI. Other Requirements. This agreement is subject to all the requirements
of the applicable Subpart of Title 7 CFR Part 1980, and any future amendments
of these regulations not inconsistent with this agreement. Interested parties
may agree to abide by future FmHA regulations not inconsistent with this
agreement.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>XVII. Execution of Agreements. If this agreement is executed prior
to the execution of the Loan Note Guarantee, this agreement does not impose
any obligation upon FmHA with respect to execution of such contract. FmHA
in no way warrants that such a contract has been or will be executed.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=20>Total $ ___ 100% $ ___</ITAG>
<ITAG tagnum=21>In consideration of the making of the subject loan by the above named
Lender, the United States of America, acting through the Farmers Home Administration
of the United States Department of Agriculture (herein called ``FmHA''),
pursuant to the Disaster Assistance Act (P.L. 100-387, 7 USC  ) does hereby
agree that in accordance with and subject to the conditions and requirements
herein, it will pay to:</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>The Lender the lesser of 1. or 2. below:</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>1. Any loss sustained by such Lender on the guaranteed portion including
principal indebtedness as evidenced by said note(s) or by assumption agreement(s),
or</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>2. The guaranteed principal advanced to or assumed by the Borrower
under said note(s) or assumption agreement(s) (Maximum   $  ). No capitalized
interest is guaranteed.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>
<T3>Definition of Holder. </T3>The Holder is the person or organization
other than the Lender who holds all or part of the guaranteed portion of
the loan with no servicing responsibilities. Holders are prohibited from
obtaining any part(s) of the guaranteed portion of the loan with proceeds
from any obligation, the interest on which is excludable from income, under
Section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (IRC). When
the Lender assigns a part(s) of the guaranteed loan to an assignee, the
assignee becomes a Holder only when Form FmHA 1980-70, ``Assignment Guarantee
Agreement_Drought and Disaster Guaranteed Loans,'' is used.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>
<T3>Definition of Lender. </T3>The Lender is the person or organization
making and servicing the loan which is guaranteed under the provisions
of the applicable subpart of 7 CFR Part 1980. The Lender is also the party
requesting a loan guarantee.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=71>Conditions of Guarantee</ITAG>
<ITAG tagnum=21>1. Loan Servicing. Lender will be responsible for servicing the entire
loan, and Lender will remain mortgagee and/or secured party of record not
withstanding the fact that another party may hold a portion of the loan.
When multiple notes are used to evidence a loan, Lender will structure
repayments as provided in the loan agreement.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>2. Priorities. The entire loan will be secured by the same security
with equal lien priority for the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions of
the loan. The unguaranteed portion of the loan will not be paid first nor
given any preference or priority over the guaranteed portion.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>3. Full Faith and Credit. The Loan Note Guarantee constitutes an obligation
supported by the full faith and credit of the United States and is incontestable
except for fraud or misrepresentation of which Lender or any Holder has
actual knowledge at the time it became such Lender or Holder or which Lender
or any Holder participates in or condones. If the note to which this is
attached or relates provides for payment of interest on interest, then
this Loan Note Guarantee is void. In addition, the Loan Note Guarantee
will be unenforceable by Lender to the extent any loss is occasioned by
the violation of usury laws, negligent servicing, or failure to obtain
the required security regardless of the time at which FmHA acquires knowledge
of the foregoing. Any losses occasioned will be unenforceable to the extent
that loan funds are used for purposes other than those specifically approved
by FmHA in its Conditional Commitment for Guarantee. Negligent servicing
is defined as the failure to perform those services which a reasonably
prudent lender would perform in servicing its own portfolio of loans that
are not guaranteed. The term includes not only the concept of a failure
to act but also not acting in a timely manner or acting in a manner contrary
to the manner in which a reasonably prudent lender would act up to the
time of loan maturity or until a final loss is paid.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>4. Rights and Liabilities. The guarantee and right to require purchase
will be directly enforceable by Holder notwithstanding any fraud or misrepresentation
by Lender or any unenforceability of this Loan Note Guarantee by Lender.
Nothing contained herein will constitute any waiver by FmHA of any rights
it possesses aganinst the Lender. Lender will be liable for and will promptly
pay to FmHA any payment made by FmHA to Holder which if such Lender had
held the guaranteed portion of the loan, FmHA would not be required to
make.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>5. Payments. Lender will receive all payments of principal, or interest,
on account of the entire loan and will promptly remit to Holder(s) its
pro rata share thereof determined according to its respective interest
in the loan, less only Lender's servicing fee.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>6. Protective Advances. Protective advances made by Lender will not
be guaranteed.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>7. Repurchase by Lender. The Lender has the option to repurchase the
unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan from the Holder(s) within 30 days
of written demand by the Holder(s) when: (a) the borrower is in default
not less than 60 days on principal or interest due on the loan or (b) the
Lender has failed to remit to the Holder(s) its pro rata share of any payment
made by the borrower or any loan subsidy within 30 days of its receipt
thereof. The repurchase by the Lender will be for an amount equal to the
unpaid guaranteed portion of principal and accrued interest less the Lender's
servicing fee. The Loan Note Guarantee will not cover the note interest
on the guaranteed loan(s). Holder(s) will concurrently send a copy of demand
to FmHA. The Lender is encouraged to repurchase the loan to facilitate
the accounting for funds, resolve the problem, and to permit the borrower
to cure the default, where reasonable. The Lender will notify the Holder(s)
and FmHA of its decision.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>8. FmHA Purchase. If Lender does not repurchase as provided by paragraph
7 hereof, FmHA will purchase from Holder the unpaid principal balance of
the guaranteed portion less Lender's servicing fee, within thirty (30)
days after written demand to FmHA from Holder. The Loan Note Guarantee
will not cover the note interest to the Holder on the guaranteed loan(s).
Such demand will include a copy of the written demand made upon the Lender.
The Holder(s) or its duly authorized agent will also include evidence of
its right to require payment from FmHA. Such evidence will consist of either
the original of the Loan Note Guarantee properly endorsed to FmHA or the
original of the Assignment Guarantee Agreement properly assigned to FmHA
without recourse including all rights, title, and interest in the loan.
FmHA will be subrogated to all rights of Holder(s). The Holder(s) will
include in its demand the amount of unpaid principal due (no capitalized
interest).</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>The Holder will also inform FmHA of the amount of past interest and
capitalized interest it is owed. Such interest is not guaranteed. The Holder(s)
remain entitled to all interest due to the point of repurchase by the Lender
or purchase by FmHA from the Holder(s) if such interest is or can be collected.
If FmHA has purchased, FmHA is equally entitled.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>The FmHA will promptly notify the Lender of its receipt of the Holder(s)'s
demand for payment. The Lender will promptly provide the FmHA with the
information necessary for FmHA determination of the appropriate amount
due the Holder(s). Any discrepancy between the amount claimed by the Holder(s)
and the information submitted by the Lender must be resolved before payment
will be approved. FmHA will notify both parties who must resolve the conflict
before payment of FmHA will be approved. Such conflict will suspend the
running of the 30 day payment requirement. Upon receipt of the appropriate
information, FmHA will review the demand and submit it to the State Director
for verification. After reviewing the demand the State Director will transmit
the request to the FmHA Finance Office for issuance of the appropriate
check. Upon issuance, the Finance Office will notify the office servicing
the borrower and State Director and remit the check(s) to the Holder(s).</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>9. 
<T3>Lender's Obligations. </T3>Lender consents to the purchase by FmHA
and agrees to furnish on request by FmHA a current statement certified
by an appropriate authorized officer of the Lender of the unpaid principal
and interest then owed by Borrowers on the loan and the amount including
any loan subsidy then owed by any Holder(s). Lender agrees that any purchase
by FmHA does not change, alter or modify any of the Lender's obligations
to FmHA arising from said loan or guarantee nor does it waive any of FmHA's
rights against Lender, and that FmHA will have the right to set-off against
Lender all rights inuring to FmHA as the Holder of this instrument against
FmHA's obligation to Lender under the Loan Note Guarantee. </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>10. 
<T3>Repurchase by Lender for Servicing. </T3>If, in the opinion of the
Lender, repurchase of the guaranteed portion of the loan is necessary to
adequately service the loan, the Holder will sell the portion of the loan
to the Lender for an amount equal to the unpaid principal and interest
(including any loan subsidy) on such portion less Lender's servicing fee.
The Loan Note Guarantee will not cover the note interest to the Holder
on the guaranteed loans. </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>a. The lender will not repurchase from the Holder(s) for arbitrage
purposes or other purposes to further its own financial gain.  </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>b. Any repurchase will only be made after the Lender obtains FmHA
written approval. </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>c. If the Lender does not repurchase the portion from the Holder(s),
FmHA at its option may purchase such guaranteed portions for servicing
purposes. </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>11. 
<T3>Custody of Unguaranteed Portion. </T3>The Lender may retain, or sell
the unguaranteed portion of the loan only through participation. Participation,
as used in this instrument, means the sale of an interest in the loan wherein
the Lender retains the note, collateral securing the note, and all responsibility
for loan servicing and liquidation. </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>12. 
<T3>When Guarantee Terminates. </T3>This Loan Note Guarantee will terminate
automatically (a) upon full payment of the guaranteed loan; or (b) upon
full payment of any loss obligation hereunder; or (c) upon written notice
from the Lender to FmHA that the guarantee will terminate 30 days after
the date of notice, provided the Lender holds all of the guaranteed portion
and the Loan Note Guarantee(s) are returned to be cancelled by FmHA.  </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>13. 
<T3>Settlement. </T3>The amount due under this instrument will be determined
and paid as provided in the applicable Subpart of Part 1980 of Title 7
CFR in effect on the date of this instrument. </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>14.

<ITAG tagnum=77>(Holder) desires to purchase from Lender ___ % of the guaranteed portion
of such loan. Copies of Borrower's note(s) and the Loan Note Guarantee
are attached hereto as a part hereof. </ITAG>
<ITAG tagnum=21>
<T3>Now, Therefore, the Parties Agree: </T3></ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>1. The principal amount of the loan now outstanding is $ ___ . Lender
hereby assigns to Holder ___ % of the guaranteed portion of the loan representing
$ ___ of such loan now outstainding in accordance with all of the terms
and conditions hereinafter set forth. The Lender and FmHA certify to the
Holder that the Lender has paid and FmHA has received the Guarantee Fee
in exchange for the issuance of the Loan Note Guarantee. </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>2. 
<T3>Loan Servicing.</T3> The Lender will be responsible for servicing the
entire loan and will remain mortgagee and/or secured party of record. The
entire loan will be secured by the same security with equal lien priority
for the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions of the loan.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>The Lender will receive all payments on account of principal of, or
interest (including any loan subsidy) on, the entire loan and shall promptly
remit to the Holder its pro rata share thereof determined according to
their respective interests in the loan, less only Lender's servicing fee.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>3. 
<T3>Servicing Fee.</T3> Holder agrees that Lender will retain a servicing
fee of ___ percent per annum of the unpaid balance of the guaranteed portion
of the loan assigned hereunder. </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>4. 
<T3>Purchase by Holder. </T3>The guaranteed protion purchased by the Holder
will always be a portion of the loan which is guaranteed. The Holder will
hereby succeed to all rights of the Lender under the Loan Note Guarantee
to the extent of the assigned portion of the loan. The Lender, however,
will remain bound by all the obligations under the Loan Note Guarantee
and the program regulations found in the applicable Subpart of 7 CFR Part
1980 now in effect and future FmHA program regulations not inconsistent
with the provisions hereof. </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>5. 
<T3>Full Faith and Credit.</T3> The Loan Note Guarantee constitutes an
obligation supported by the full faith and credit of the United States
and is inconstestable except for fraud or misrepresentation of which the
Holder has actual knowledge at the time of this assignment, or which it
participates in or condones. A note which provides for the payment of interest
on interest shall not be guaranteed. Any Assignment Guarantee Agreement_Drought
and Disaster Guaranteed Loan attached to or relating to a note which provides
for payment of interest on interest is void. </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>6. 
<T3>Rights and Liabilities.</T3> The guarantee and right to require purchase
will be directly enforceable by Holder notwithstanding any fraud or misrepresentations
by Lender or any unenforceability of the Loan Note Guarantee by Lender.
Nothing contained herein shall constitute any waiver by FmHA of any rights
it possesses against the Lender, and the Lender agrees that Lender will
be liable and will promptly reimburse FmHA for any payment made by FmHA
to Holder which, if such Lender had held the guaranteed portion of the
loan, FmHA would not be required to make. The Holder(s) upon written notice
to the Lender may resell the unpaid balance of the guaranteed portion of
the loan assigned hereunder. An endorsement may be added to the Form FmHA
1980-70 to effectuate the transfer. </ITAG>

<T2>ACTION: </T2>Final rule.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its regulations
to designate the Assistant Administrator_Community and Business Programs
as the official within the organization of Farmers Home Administration
responsible for administration of Drought and Disaster (D&amp;D) Guaranteed
Loans made available in section 331 of the Disaster Assistance Act of 1988
(Pub. L. 100-387) and to further designate the Business and Industry Division
as the division responsible for overseeing the making and servicing of
D&amp;D guaranteed loans. Authority to administer these loan guarantees
has been delegated by the Secretary of Agriculture to the Under Secretary
for Small Community and Rural Development and redelegated to the Administrator
of Farmers Home Administration. FmHA also corrects an error in the description
of the functions of the Community Facilities Division.

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Farmers Home Administration responsibility
for administration of guarantees of loans to rural business entities to
further rural development and to save and create jobs in rural areas has
been located in the Assistant Administrator_Community and Business Programs.
The Administrator, FmHA, having been delegated responsibility for the guarantee
of loans to rural business entities for disaster relief (Drought and Disaster
Guaranteed Loans), locates that authority in the Assistant Administrator_Community
and Business Programs_and, within his functional area, in the Business
and Industry Division. FmHA also corrects an error in the description of
functions of the Community Facilities Division, deleting an inference that
that division has responsibility for water-related facilities.

This rule relates to internal agency management. Therefore, pursuant to
5 U.S.C. 553, notice of proposed rule making and opportunity for comments
is not required, and this rule may be made effective less than 30 days
after publication in the 
<T4>Federal Register. </T4>Further, since this rule relates to internal
agency management, it is exempt from the provisions of Executive Order
12291. Finally, this action is not a rule as defined by the Regulatory
Flexibility Act and thus is exempt from the provisions of that Act.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Environmental Impact Statement</ITAG>

This document has been reviewed according to 7 CFR Part 1940, Subpart G,
``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that this action
does not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the
quality of the human environment, and in accordance with the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-190, an Environmental Impact Statement is
not required.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Intergovernmental Review</ITAG>

The Business and Industry program/activity is listed in the Catalog of
Federal Domestic Assistance under number 10.422 and the Community Facilities
program/activity is listed therein under number 10.423. They are subject
to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental
consultation with State and local officials (7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V,
48 FR 29112, June 24, 1983).

<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>This rule implements provisions of the United States-Canada
Free-Trade Agreement (FTA) by establishing procedures for temporary entry
of Canadian citizen business persons into the United States. This rule
will facilitate temporary entry on a reciprocal basis between the United

security, and to protect indigenous labor and permanent employment in both
countries.
</ITAG>

<T2>DATES: </T2>Effective on the date the United States-Canada Free-Trade
Agreement enters into force. The Immigration and Naturalization Service

<T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Edward H. Skerrett, Senior Immigration
Examiner, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street, NW.,
Room 7122, Washington, DC 20536, Telephone: (202) 633-3946.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On January 2, 1988, the President of
the United States and the Prime Minister of Canada entered into the FTA.
Implementation of this agreement has been provided for by the United States-Canada
Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-449 (FTA Implementation
Act). The FTA was passed by the United States House of Representatives
on August 9, 1988, and by the United States Senate on September 19, 1988.
It was signed by the President on September 28, 1988. It is anticipated
that the FTA will enter into force on January 1, 1989.

This rule pertains to Canadian citizen temporary visitors for business
seeking classification under section 101(a)(15)(B) of the Immigration and
Nationality Act (Act), to Canadian citizen treaty traders and investors
seeking classification under section 101(a)(15)(E) of the Act, to Canadian
citizen temporary workers seeking classification under section 101(a)(15)(L)
of the Act, and to Canadian citizens seeking classification for engagement
in activities at a professional level under section 214(e) of the Act,
as added by section 307 of the FTA Implementation Act.

This rule establishes procedures for the temporary entry of Canadian citizen
business persons as provided in Chapter Fifteen of the FTA and section
307 of the FTA Implementation Act. Chapter Fifteen, section 307, and this
rule reflect the special trading relationship between the United States
and Canada, the desirability of facilitating temporary entry on a reciprocal
basis, and the desirability of establishing transparent criteria and procedures
for temporary entry, while recognizing the continued need to ensure border
security and protect indigenous labor and permanent employment in both
countries.

Section 103.7(b) is amended to add a fee for classification of a citizen
of Canada to be engaged in business activities at a professional level
pursuant to section 214(e) of the Act, as added by section 307 of the FTA
Implementation Act. Form I-94 (Arrival/Departure Record) and a receipt
(Form G-211, Form G-711, or Form I-797) will be given to each citizen of
Canada classified under section 214(e) of the Act. Although a petition
is not required for this classification, the level of documentation presented
to the immigration officer will be on a par with that required for nonimmigrant
classifications for which petitions are required. This factor coupled with
the reciprocal aspects of the FTA require that a fee be charged. The government
of Canada intends to charge an employment authorization fee for citizens
of the United States entering Canada under the FTA to engage in business
activities at professional level.

Section 212.1(1) sets forth the requirement that a Canadian citizen seeking
admission as a treaty trader or investor under the provisions of Chapter
15 of the FTA and pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(E) of the Act shall be
in possession of a nonimmigrant visa. Regulations pertaining to the issuance
of such visas will be provided by the United States Department of State.

Section 214.2(b)(4) states that various types of Canadian citizen business
personnel would be classifiable as visitors for business under section
101(a)(15)(B) of the Act, provided that they are to receive no salary or
other remuneration from a United States source other than incidental expenses.
This listing has been compiled from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's Operations Instructions, the Department of State's Foreign Affairs
Manual, and various policy statements which have been issued by the Service
over the years and which pertain specifically to Canadian citizens. This
is not an exhaustive list and does not preclude the admission under section
101(a)(15)(B) of the Act of a Canadian citizen business person engaged
in an occupation or profession not on the list.

Of special significance is &Section; 214.2(b)(4)(i)(F), pertaining to after-sales
service. This paragraph extends the performance of after-sales service
and training to the life of the warranty or service agreement and adds
computer software to commercial or industrial equipment or machinery. This
provision of the FTA and this regulation are not in conflict with the reasoning
of 
<T3>Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen </T3>v. 
<T3>Meese,</T3> 616 F. Supp. 1387 (N.D. Cal. 1985).

Section 214.2(l)(17) provides for the adjudication of individual petitions
for classification of Canadian citizens under section 101(a)(15)(L) of
the Act at certain United States ports of entry and pre-flight inspection
stations. This paragraph also provides for determination of eligibility
of Canadian citizens seeking L classification under pre-approved blanket
petitions at these same locations. Blanket petitions must still be filed
in advance at the appropriate Regional Service Centers.

A spouse or minor child holding Canadian citizenship or of a common nationality
with Canadians will not be required to obtain a nonimmigrant visa to accompany
or follow to join a Canadian citizen principal who is classified as an
L-1; however, a non-Canadian citizen spouse or minor child will be required
to obtain a nonimmigrant visa and, therefore, will only be able to follow
to join.

Section 214.6 sets forth procedures relating to Canadian citizens coming
to the United States to engage in activities at a professional level. Admission
under this provision of the FTA does not imply that the Canadian citizen
would otherwise qualify as a professional under sections 101(a)(15)(H)(i)
or 203(a)(3) of the Act.

No prior petition, labor certification, or prior approval shall be required;
however, Canadian citizens seeking classification under this provision
must pesent documentation sufficient to satisfy the inspecting officer
that they are seeking entry to engage in activities at a professional level
and that they are so qualified.

This paragraph sets in regulation Schedule 2 to Annex 1502.1 of the FTA
which is a listing of occupations agreed upon by both countries. A baccalaureate
is the minimum requirement for these professions, unless otherwise specified.
In the case of a Canadian citizen whose occupation does not appear on the
list or who does not meet the transparent criteria, nothing precludes the
filing of a petition for classification under another existing nonimmigrant
classification.

As with the spouse and minor child of L-1 Canadian citizens, a nonimmigrant
visa shall not be required of a spouse or minor child who possesses Canadian
citizenship or is of a common nationality with Canadians. Visas will be
required of all others.

Section 274a.12(b)(16) adds Canadian citizens engaged in business activities
at a professional level pursuant to Chapter Fifteen of the FTA to the classes
of aliens authorized employment with a specific employer(s) incident to
status.

In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of Immigration and
Naturalization certifies that this rule will not have a significant adverse
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This is not
a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does
this rule have federalism implications warranting the preparation of a
Federal Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.

The information collection requirements contained in this document have
been approved by the Office of Management and Budget in accordance with
the Paperwork Reduction Act and are cited under 8 CFR 299.5.

<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>

<ITAG tagnum=84>Background</ITAG>

On December 12, 1988, temporary regulations relating to the allocation
and apportionment of deductions for state income taxes in computing taxable
income from sources inside and outside the United States were published
in the 
<T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 49873). The text of the temporary regulations
served as the text of the proposed regulations cross-referenced in the
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Proposed Rules section of the same
issue of the 
<T4>Federal Register</T4>.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Need for Correction</ITAG>

As published, the temporary rules contain typographical errors and omissions
which may prove to be misleading and are in need of correction.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Correction of Publication</ITAG>

Accordingly, the publication of the temporary rules (T.D. 8236), which
was the subject of FR Doc. 88-28460 (53 FR 49873), is corrected as follows:

1. In the preamble, under the heading ``DISCUSSION'', in subheading ``Section
1.861-8'', on page 49873, column 2, line 2, the language ``reserving paragraph
(e)(b) of &Section; 1.861-8,'' should read ``reserving paragraph (e) of
&Section; 1.861-8,''.

2. In the preamble, under the subheading ``Section 1.861-8T(e)(6)'', on
page 49873, column 2, line 9, the language ``imposed. Paragraph (e)(6)(ii)
clarifies'' should read ``imposed. Paragraph (e)(6)(i) also clarifies''.

3. In the preamble, under the same subheading, page and column, line 13,
the language ``an income tax. This paragraph also cites'' should read ``an
income tax. Paragraph (e)(6)(ii) also cites''.

4. In the preamble, under the same subheading and page, column 3, line
9, the language ``taxable years, and that the regulations'' should read
``taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976, and that the regulations''.

5. In the preamble, under the subheading ``Section 1.861-8T(g)'', on page
49873, column 3, second paragraph under that subheading, line 1, the language
``Paragraph (g) &Section; 1.861-8T(g) then'' should read ``Paragraph (g)
&Section; 1.861-8T then''.

<ITAG tagnum=80>&Section; 1.861-8T [Corrected]</ITAG>

6. On page 49875, column 1, in &Section; 1.861-8T(e)(6)(iii), lines 2 and
3, which read ``&Section; 1.861(e)(6)(i) are effective for all taxable
years. The rules of &Section; 1.861-'' should read ``&Section; 1.861-8T(e)(6)(i)
are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1976. The
rules of &Section; 1.861-''.

7. On page 49875, column 1, the next printed line immediately following
the conclusion of &Section; 1.861-8T(e)(6)(iii) should read ``* * * *''.

8. On page 49876, column 2, in &Section; 1.861-8T(g), Example (28)(i)(B),
line 4, which reads ``X having a total of $1,000,000 of'' should read ``X
having a total of $1,100,000 of''.

9. On page 49877, column 1, in &Section; 1.861-8T(g), Example (28)(iii),
last line in the table, which reads ``tas deduction . . . 64,000'' should
read ``tax deduction . . . . 64,000''.

10. On page 49877, column 2, in &Section; 1.861-8T(g), Example (29)(i)
line 5, which reads ``H. P also has a branch on country Y which'' should
read ``H. P also has a branch in country Y which'' and, line 10, which
reads ``corporation (``CFC'') ad defined in section 957'' should read ``corporation
(``CFC'') as defined in section 957''.

<T2>ACTION: </T2>Notice of fee adjustments.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>This notice revises the Mine Safety and Health Administration's
(MSHA) user fees for testing, evaluation and approval of certain products
manufactured for use in underground mines. These fees are based on Fiscal
Year 1988 data and reflect changes in approval processing operations as
well as costs incurred to process approval actions.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>DATES: </T2>These fee schedules are effective from January 1, 1989
through December 31, 1989. Approval applications postmarked before January
1, 1989 will be chargeable under the fee schedules as published on May
8, 1987.

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In general, MSHA has computed the revised
fees based on the cost to the government to provide testing, evaluation,
and approval of products manufactured for use in underground mines. On
May 8, 1987 (52 FR 17506), MSHA published a final rule, 30 CFR Part 5_Fees
for Testing, Evaluation, and Approval of Mining Products, which established
the specific procedures for fee calculation, administration, and revisions.
This revised fee schedule is established in accordance with the procedures
of that rule.

The fee schedules include updated fees resulting from the publication of
two final rules: Part 7_Product Testing by Applicant or Third Party (53
FR 23486), and Part 15_Approval of Explosives and Sheathed Explosive Units
(53 FR 46748). Under the provisions of Part 5, four approval areas have
been converted from hourly rates to flat rates: Field Approval, Mine-Wide
Monitoring System (MWMS) Evaluation, MWMS Barrier Classification, and MWMS
Sensor Classification. All flat rate approvals require payment at the time
of application submittal.

</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>ACTION: </T2>Final Rule.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>This rule reflects a change in U.S. policy to facilitate
private citizen travel to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (``North
Korea''). Despite the existing restrictions on providing travel services
in conjunction with travel to North Korea contained in the Foreign Assets
Control Regulations, 31 CFR Part 500 (the ``Regulations''), travel service
providers may seek specific licenses for the provision of services in connection
with certain types of group and individual travel to North Korea.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>January 3, 1989.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>William B. Hoffman, Chief Counsel
(tel.: 202/376-0408), or Steven I. Pinter, Chief of Licensing (tel.: 202/376-0392),
Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury, Washington,
DC 20220.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Consistent with the current foreign
policy of the United States to facilitate unofficial, nongovernmental exchanges
with North Korea, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is reviewing
the Regulations with regard to the provision of travel services in connection
with travel to, from, and within North Korea, particularly for U.S. individuals
or groups involved in academic, sports, cultural, and certain other areas.
Travel service providers may apply for specific licenses authorizing them
to engage in transactions necessary to arrange or facilitate such exchanges
and other noncommercial travel beyond the scope of transactions now authorized
in &Section; 500.563(d)(1) of the regulations (53 FR 7354, March 6, 1988).
The amendment provides that license applications will be reviewed on a
case-by-case basis. Licensing procedures are set forth in &Section; 500.801
of the regulations.

A specific license granted under this rule authorizes certain transactions
otherwise prohibited under &Section;&Section; 500.201 and 500.563(d) of
the regulations. Those provisions limit the services that travel service
providers may offer to persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction to the booking
of pasage for transportation to and from North Korea aboard third-country
carriers. In the absence of a specific license under this rule, such services
may only be provided with respect to unsolicited inquiries from prospective
travelers.

Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, the provisions
of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of
proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in
effective date, are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking
is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601
<T3>et seq.</T3>, does not apply. Because the Regulations are issued with
respect to a foreign affairs function of the United States, they are not
subject to Executive Order 12291 of February 17, 1981, dealing with Federal
regulations.

<ITAG tagnum=84>List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 500</ITAG>

North Korea, Travel restrictions.

For the reasons set out in the preamble, 31 CFR Part 500 is amended as
set forth below:

travel service providers in connection with group and individual travel
to North Korea for noncommercial tours and private exchange programs in
academic, sports, cultural, and certain other areas.

<T2>AGENCY: </T2>Office of Foreign Assets Control, Department of the Treasury.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>ACTION: </T2>Final rule.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>On April 8, 1988, the President issued Executive Order
No. 12635, declaring a national emergency with respect to Panama, invoking
the authority, inter alia, of the International Emergency Economic Powers
Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), ordering specified measures against the Noriega/Solis
regime in Panama. In implementation of that Order, the Treasury Department
issued the Panamanian Transactions Regulations, 53 FR 20566 (June 3, 1988),
as amended at 53 FR 23620 (June 23, 1988); 53 FR 32221 (August 24, 1988);
and 53 FR 37556 (September 27, 1988) (the ``Regulations''). The Regulations
prohibit, inter alia, transfers and payments to the Noriega/Solis regime
from the United States, or by U.S. persons and U.S.-controlled Panamanian
entities located in Panama, with certain exceptions, and require that amounts
owed to the Government of Panama be paid into an account of the Government
of Panama maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the ``FRBNY'').
This rule amends the Regulations to authorize a substitute procedure for
payment to the FRBNY. Persons owing amounts to the Government of Panama
may apply for a specific license authorizing the blocking of the amounts
owed, plus applicable interest, in a reserve account on their books. Any
person who has already made payments to the FRBNY and who wishes to transfer
the funds to a blocked reserve account, may apply to the Office of Foreign
Assets Control for a license authorizing such a transfer.

</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Since the Regulations involve a foreign
affairs function, the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5
U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public
participation, and delay in effective date, are inapplicable. Because no
notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory
Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., does not apply. Because the Regulations
are issued with respect to a foreign affairs function of the United States,
they are not subject to Executive Order 12291 of February 17, 1981, dealing
with Federal regulations.

The collections of information in this regulation are in &Section; 565.509
of Title 31 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The information required
under this section is necessary in order for the Office of Foreign Assets
Control to evaluate the merits of a license application seeking to establish
a reserve account containing funds owed the Government of Panama by U.S.
persons, in lieu of transferring those funds into an account at the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York as provided in &Section;&Section; 565.202 and
565.203, and to monitor compliance with the requirements of this part.
The likely respondents are individuals and businesses.

The estimated total annual reporting burden is 1000 hours. The estimated
average annual burden hours per respondent is five hours. The estimated
number of respondents is 200. Comments concerning the collection of information
and the accuracy of this burden estimate, and suggestions for reducing
this burden should be directed to the Office of Information and Regulatory
Affairs, Attention: Desk Officer for the Office of Foreign Assets Control,
U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Management and Budget, Washington,
DC 20503, with copies of the Office of Information Resources Management,
Department of the Treasury, 15th &amp; Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington,
DC 20220.

<ITAG tagnum=84>List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 565</ITAG>

Panama, Blocking of assets, Transfers of assets, Penalties, Reporting and
recordkeeping requirements.

For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 31 CFR Part 565 is amended as
follows:

<ITAG tagnum=52>PART 565_PANAMANIAN TRANSACTIONS REGULATIONS</ITAG>

1. The authority citation for Part 565 continues to read as follows:

<ITAG tagnum=21>
<T4>Authority: </T4>50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.; E.O. 12635, 53 FR 12134 (April
12, 1988).</ITAG>

2. Section 565.509 is added to read as follows:

<ITAG tagnum=80>&Section; 565.509</ITAG>
<ITAG tagnum=89>Reserve accounts.</ITAG>

(a) United States persons and U.S.-controlled Panamanian entities who are
required under &Section;&Section; 565.202 and 565.203 to make payments
and transfers of certain funds owed to the Government of Panama into Government
of Panama Account No. 2 at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, may elect
instead to apply for a specific license authorizing them to establish a
substitute blocked reserve account on their books in the name of the Panamanian
governmental entity to whom the amount is owed. Specific licenses may be
issued to permit payment into such reserve accounts of amounts due and
owing the Government of Panama, which amounts shall include the principal
amount of funds due, plus interest thereon, determined pursuant to paragraph
(b) of this section, accrued from the later of April 8, 1988, or the date
the payment obligation to the Government of Panama first arose, to the
date of payment into the reserve account. In the case of funds already
credited to Government of Panama Account No. 2, specific licenses may be
issued authorizing transfer of such funds (including accrued interest)
to such reserve accounts. Such licenses are revocable, and are conditioned
upon continued compliance with the requirements of this part. Upon revocation
of a license or at the direction of the Director of the Office of Foreign
Assets Control, funds held in such reserve accounts must be paid into Government
of Panama Account No. 2.

(b) Funds credited to reserve accounts pursuant to this section shall bear
interest at a rate not less than the weekly average effective Federal Funds
rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Board, applicable to each week
of the period in which credit balances are maintained pursuant to this
section.

(c) If necessary to assure the availability of funds blocked in reserve
accounts pursuant to this section, the Director of the Office of Foreign
Assets Control may at any time require the payment of such blocked funds
into Government of Panama Account No. 2 at the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, as provided in &Section; 565.404, or the supplying of any form
of security deemed necessary.

(d) A person receiving a specific license under paragraph (a) of this section
shall certify to the Office of Foreign Assets Control within fifteen business
days after receipt of that license that it has established the reserve
account on its books as provided in that paragraph. Unless otherwise provided,
a person licensed to establish such a reserve account shall file monthly
reports with the Office of Foreign Assets Control setting forth all credits
to the reserve account, and interest payable in accordance with paragraph
(b) of this section on the reserve account, together with the nature of
the debt, and the name of the Panamanian governmental entity to which it
is owed. The report shall also contain a certification from an authorized
official of the entity affirming that the entity submitting the report
is in compliance with all other requirements of this part.

<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>This notice implements 33 CFR 100.501 for the New Year's
Eve Celebration. The event will be held on the Elizabeth River, adjacent
to ``Waterside'', between the Norfolk and Portsmouth downtown areas. The
celebration will consist of a fireworks display launched from the Mast
Area of Town Point Park, Waterside, Norfolk, Virginia from Midnight, December
31, 1988 to 12:30 a.m., January 1, 1989. The special local regulations
in 33 CFR 100.501 are needed to control vessel traffic within the immediate
vicinity of the event due to the confined nature of the waterway and the
expected congestion at the time of the event. The regulations restrict
general navigation in the area for the safety of life and property on the
navigable waters during the event.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>EFFECTIVE DATES: </T2>The regulations in 33 CFR 100.501 are effective
from 11:30 p.m., December 31, 1988 to 1:00 a.m., January 1, 1989. In case
of inclement weather causing the event to be postponed, the regulations
in 33 CFR 100.501 are effective from 6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m., January 1,
1989.

Division, Fifth Coast Guard District, and Lieutenant Commander Robin K.
Kutz, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Staff.

<T3>Discussion of Regulations:</T3> The regulations in 33 CFR 100.501 govern
the operation of the marine events held on the Elizabeth River in the vicinity
of ``Wasterside'', downtown Norfolk, Virginia. The implementation of 33
CFR 100.501 also implements regulations in 33 CFR 110.72aa. The regulations
in 33 CFR 110.72aa establish the spectator anchorages in 33 CFR 100.501
as special anchorage areas under Inland Navigation Rule 30, 33 U.S.C. 2030(g).
These regulations are implemented by publication of this notice in the
<T4>Federal Register</T4> and a notice in the Local Notice to Mariners.
Norfolk Festevents Ltd. submitted an application that was received by the
Commander, Coast Guard Group, Hampton Roads, on December 5, 1988 to hold
a fireworks display on December 31, 1988 in the ``Waterside'' area of the
Elizabeth River between downtown Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia. The
fireworks will be launched from the Mass Area of Town Point Park. Spectator
vessels are expected to be in the spectator anchorage areas during the
fireworks display.

Since the waterway will not be closed for extended periods, commercial
traffic should not be severely disrupted.

The regulations in 33 CFR 100.501 are hereby implemented.

<T3>Drafting Information: </T3>The drafters of this notice are Mr. Billy
J. Stephenson, Project officer, Chief, Boating Affairs Branch, Boating
Safety Division, Fifth Coast Guard District, and Lieutenant Commander Robin
K. Kutz, project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Staff.

<T3>Discussion of Regulations: </T3>The regulations in 33 CFR 100.501 govern
the operation of marine events held on the Elizabeth River in the vicinity
of ``Waterside'', downtown Norfolk, Virginia. The implementation of 33
CFR 100.501, also implements regulations in 33 CFR 110.72aa and 117.1007.
The regulations in 33 CFR 110.72aa establish the spectator anchorages in
33 CFR 100.501 as special anchorage areas under Inland Navigation Rule
30, 33 U.S.C. 2030(g). The regulations in 33 CFR 117.1007 close the draw
of the Berkley Bridge to vessels during and within one hour of the effective
period under 33 CFR 100.501. These regulations are implemented by publication
of this implementing notice in the Federal Register and a notice in the
Local Notice to Mariners.

The Coast Guard Auxiliary, Fifth District Southern Region, the sponsor
of the event, has submitted an application to hold the United States Coast
Guard Auxiliary Fiftieth Anniversary Celebration on June 23, 1989 in the
area covered by 33 CFR 100.501. The celebration will consist of a Coast
Guard Auxiliary aircraft flyover, a parade made up of Coast Guard and Coast
Guard Auxiliary vessels, a Coast Guard helicopter, and Coast Guard buoy
tender demonstration.

Since this event is the type of event contemplated by these regulations
and the safety of the participants and spectators viewing the event would
be enhanced by the implementation of 33 CFR 100.501, those regulations
are hereby implemented.

Commercial vessels will be permitted to transit the regulated area between
events, so commercial traffic should not be severely disrupted at any given
time.

<T2>action: </T2>Final rule. 
 </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>summary: </T2>At the request of the New Jersey Department of Transportation,
the Coast Guard is amending the regulations governing the Route 52 drawbridge
over Ship Channel, Great Egg Harbor Bay, at mile 0.5, between Somers Point
and Ocean City, New Jersey, by limiting the number of openings for recreational
vessels to the hour and half hour during daylight hours on weekends and
Federal holidays during the summer. This amendment is being made to accommodate
periods of increased peak marine and vehicular traffic and to synchronize
openings with the Route 52 (Ninth Street) drawbridge over Beach Thorofare
to minimize vehicular congestion. This action should accommodate the needs
of vehicular traffic, while providing for the reasonable needs of navigation.
This rule also makes provisions for opening the bridge on less than 24
hours advance notice between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. for any public vessel of
the United States, state and local vessel used for public safety, vessel
in distress, or vessel with another vessel in tow. This action is necessary
to handle emergency situations. 
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>supplementary information: </T2>On July 7, 1987, the Coast Guard published
a notice of proposed rulemaking concerning this amendment in the 
<T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 25392). The Commander, Fifth Coast Guard
District, also published the proposal as Public Notice number 5-641, dated
July 10, 1987. In each notice, interested persons were given until September
30, 1987 to submit comments. 

<ITAG tagnum=84>Drafting Information </ITAG>

The drafters of these regulations are Waverly W. Gregory, Jr., project
manager, First Coast Guard District Bridge Branch, and CAPT Robert J. Reining,
project attorney, Fifth Coast Guard District Legal Staff. 

<ITAG tagnum=84>Discussion of Final Rule and Comments </ITAG>

This amendment is being made in an effort to relieve vehicular traffic
from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays between
Memorial Day and Labor Day. Vehicular traffic is at its peak during this
period. Synchronizing openings of this bridge with the Route 52 drawbridge
across Beach Thorofare will help minimize repeat delays to vehicular traffic
and improve traffic flow. A temporary rule was published in the 
<T4>Federal Register </T4>on July 7, 1987 (52 FR 25372) to evaluate the
proposed rule for a 60-day period. That temporary rule was in effect from
July 2 through August 30, 1987. It limited bridge openings to the hour
and half hour for recreational and commercial vessels. A total of 313 bridge
openings occurred in July, and 457 openings occurred in August 1987. Of
the 313 July openings, 76 occurred between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., on Saturdays,
Sundays, and the 4th of July (24% of the total openings for the month).
In August, 101 of the 457 total openings occurred during the same periods
(22% of the total openings for the month). 

During July 1987, 36 of the 313 openings involved solely commercial vessels
(12% of the total openings for the month), with 5 of the 36 occurring between
the hours of 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays and the 4th of
July. Likewise, 51 of the 457 openings during August 1987 involved solely
commercial vessels (11% of the total openings for the month). Ten of these
openings occurred during the limited opening periods on weekends. Traffic
observations by the City of Somers Point Police Department during the trial
period showed that vehicular traffic flow improved on Saturdays and Sundays
during the limited opening periods. Random observations made of vehicular
traffic at bridge openings during the period noted that all traffic cleared
within five minutes. Prior to the restriction on openings, traffic took
seven to eight minutes to clear. It should be noted that due to environmental
problems with the waters in the area, traffic and tourism was down significantly
in August 1987. 

One comment from a charter boat owner was received in response to the public
notice on the proposed change. He stated that his operation would be adversely
affected because the opening restrictions would delay his fishing and dinner
cruise patrons by thirty minutes if his vessel missed a scheduled opening.
Because his business consists of half-day fishing trips and chartered dinner
cruises, either his patrons or his business would have to suffer.

As a result of this comment the final rule requires the bridge to open
on signal during the limited opening periods for commercial vessels. Because
of the limited number of openings that result from the passage of commercial
vessels, this change should not have a significant adverse impact on weekend
traffic between the hours of 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. The final rule also differs
from the proposed rule, which would have required the bridge to open on
signal between the hours of 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. for public vessels of the
United States, vessels in distress, and vessels with another vessel in
tow. The current regulations only require the bridge to open between those
hours if 24 hours advance notice is given. The final rule has been modified
to give the bridge owner and operator up to 30 minutes to open the bridge
for these vessels during the 24 hour advance notice period. Since the bridge
is not manned between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m., imposing a requirement for the
bridge to open on signal would have imposed an unnecessary financial hardship
on the operator, since there is generally insufficient traffic to justify
opening the bridge during those hours. However, the operator is willing
to make arrangements for expeditious openings of the bridge in emergency
situations. 

<ITAG tagnum=84>Federalism Implication Assessment </ITAG>

This action has been analyzed under the principles and criteria in Executive
Order 12612, and it has been determined that this final rule does not have
sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federal
Assessment. 

<ITAG tagnum=84>Economic Assessment and Certification </ITAG>

These regulations are considered to be non-major under Executive Order
12291 on Federal Regulation, and nonsignificant under the Department of
Transportation regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February
26, 1979). The economic impact has been found to be so minimal that a full
regulatory evaluation is unnecessary. The change in regulations will permit
a more orderly flow of both vehicular and recreational marine traffic and
permit each mode of traffic to schedule its transits of the bridge to minimize
delay. The final rule also eliminates any new hardships to the limited
commercial traffic that might have resulted from adoption of the proposed
rule. The final rule preserves the current right to have the bridge open
on signal between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. outside the restricted periods on
weekends and Federal holidays during the summer. Since the impact of these
regulations is expected to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies that they
will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities.

<T2>summary: </T2>On May 24, 1988, EPA published a final rule promulgating
effluent limitations guidelines and new source performance standards limiting
effluent discharges to waters of the United States from facilities engaged
in gold placer mining operations (53 FR 18764). In the preamble to the
final regulation, the Agency requested comment concerning the economic
impacts imposed on small placer mines (mines processing between 1,500 and
35,000 cubic yards of ore per year) by this regulation and stated that
should significant additional data be presented to the Agency on small
placer mines demonstrating that different effluent limitations guidelines
and standards are warranted on a national basis, the Agency would modify
the rule. 

The Agency received 61 submissions containing approximately 163 individual
comments on the issue on which EPA requested comment. Copies of these submissions,
a summary of the comments with responses by the Agency, copies of other
correspondence related to the impacts on small mines of the final rule,
and copies of data and information used by the Agency in responding to
comments are being made available in the post-promulgation record of the
gold placer mine subcategory regulation. 

Based on its review of these materials, the Agency has decided not to modify
the final rule promulgated May 24, 1988.

<T2>supplementary information: </T2>On May 24, 1988, EPA published a final
rule promulgating effluent limitations guidelines and new source performance
standards limiting effluent discharges to waters of the United States from
facilities engaged in gold placer mining operations (53 FR 18764). In the
preamble to this final regulation the Agency provided an opportunity for
the public to submit significant additional data demonstrating that different
limitations were warranted for small gold placer mines (those processing
between 1,500 and 35,000 cu yd of ore per year). The Agency provided for
a 60-day period, but did not specify the beginning or end of this period.
A notice clarifying the period of time during which the Agency would receive
comments was published July 1, 1988 (53 FR 24939). The Agency made the
administrative record for this rulemaking available to the public on June
17, 1988. In order to provide adequate time for the public to acquaint
itself with the administrative record and submit new data and comment,
the Agency set the 60-day period to start June 17, 1988 and close on August
16, 1988. 

The 61 comments received by EPA were from industry groups, government agencies
and individual citizens. Most of the commenters contended that BAT limitations
and NSPS based upon recirculation of process wastewater were not economically
achievable for small gold placer mines. However, very few commenters provided
any additional data as requested by EPA in the preamble to the final rule.
Data were provided by the Department of the Interior (DOI). The Agency
has carefully reviewed all of the information provided by commenters and
determined that the data do not justify a change with respect to the economic
methodology used by EPA to project the economic impacts of the final regulation.
The Agency continues to believe that the effluent limitations guidelines
and new source performance standards imposed by the rule are economically
achievable for all gold placer mine size categories. Therefore, the Agency
is not modifying the rule promulgated on May 24, 1988. 

Commenters on the final rule contended that EPA had understated several
mining and compliance cost parameters, such as reclamation, maintenance,
piping and pond construction costs, and that EPA had inappropriately excluded
certain costs, such as mine patenting, from its analysis. The DOI also
criticized the Agency's database and assumptions regarding the ore grades
(i.e., the amount of gold recovered per cubic yard of ore processed by
a mine) that are being mined in Alaska, and submitted additinal data to
EPA. EPA has fully evaluated these contentions and the data that were submitted
by commenters, and concluded that the Agency adequately considered operating
and compliance costs when it promulgated the final rule, and that the Agency's
ore grade database and assumptions were valid and appropriate for estimating
placer mine revenues in its economic impact analysis. Below is a summary
of the Agency's evaluation and conclusions regarding the major issues raised
by commenters. EPA's complete analysis and discussion of these issues and
all other public comments are contained in two support documents that will
be included in the record for this decision: ``Response to Comments on
the Final Rule for the Gold Placer Mining Subcategory'' (``Comment-Response
Document''), and ``Summary Report on Comments and Analysis of Data Submitted
after Promulgation of the Gold Placer Mine Effluent Limitations Guidelines
and Standards'' (``Summary Report''). 

EPA's conclusion as to the achievability of the regulation is reaffirmed
by information collected during site visits conducted by Agency staff during
the 1988 mining season. Of the 85 active Alaskan mines that were visited
by EPA, approximately half (including mines of all sizes) had already instituted
recirculation of process water. This information supports EPA's conclusions
that recirculation technology is in widespread use in the gold placer mining
industry, and that requiring all mines to meet limitations based on this
practice will not cause the significant economic dislocation projected
by the industry or the Department of the Interior. In addition, EPA notes
that monitoring data submitted by Alaskan miners to EPA from the 1988 mining
season also indicate that the limitation of 0.2 ml/1 for settleable solids
imposed by the regulation (and which is currently contained in permits
issued by EPA) is being achieved by approximately 95% of gold placer mines.

<ITAG tagnum=84>1. Reclamation Costs</ITAG>

With regard to costs of reclamation, EPA's cost estimates at promulgation
were based upon information supplied by the Bureau of Land Management and
a published report on mining practices and costs. On the basis of the average
per acre reclamation cost derived from these sources, EPA estimated that
very small and small mines incurred reclamation costs of $2,543 and $2,918.
In its comments, the DOI contended that EPA failed to take into account
the cost of reclaiming settling ponds, and recommended that EPA assume
all very small and small mines incur reclamation costs of $2,000 per site
and $1,270 per acre of settling pond to be reclaimed. The DOI also contended
that very small and small mines would have to reclaim two acres and four
acres of ponds, respectively.

Contrary to DOI's assertion, EPA did consider the costs of reclaiming settling
ponds in its analysis. The Agency's reclamation cost estimates were based
upon the cost to reclaim the entire mining area, including the area for
settling ponds which EPA field observations indicate are generally constructed
in mine tailings. The total reclamation costs allocated by EPA in its analysis
therefore included the costs of reclaiming the land on which settling ponds
are located.

In addition, the Department did not provide data to support its assertion
that very small and small mines would have to build and reclaim two and
four acres of settling ponds per year. These assumptions result in a significant
overestimate of total reclamation costs. EPA has determined, based upon
data collected from operating placer mines and other sources, that very
small and small mines will be able to treat wastewater for an entire season
with ponds that are approximately one-half and one acre, in size, respectively.
Indeed, when the DOI's suggested reclamation costs are applied based upon
correct pond size dimensions, the resulting total reclamation costs are
comparable to those assigned by EPA in its analysis. EPA therefore concludes
that much of the information submitted by the DOI supports, rather than
calls into question, the reclamation costs assigned by EPA in its analysis.

<ITAG tagnum=84>2. Maintenance Costs</ITAG>

EPA also disagrees with the DOI's contention that EPA should have allocated
higher maintenance costs in its analysis. No actual data were provided
by the Department in support of its suggested maintenance factors. The
maintenance factors used by EPA were based, in large part, upon quotations
from equipment suppliers documented in the public record. In addition,
the Department apparently misconstrued the factors actually applied by
EPA, which varied according to the particular piece of equipment in question.
In some cases the factors used by EPA were comparable to those suggested
by the DOI. The Comment-Response and Summary Report documents contained
in the public record clarify the specific maintenance factors used by EPA
in its analysis. Finally, through the application of variance cost factors
described in the preamble to the final rule, EPA's analysis took into account
the higher operating costs (including costs for maintenance) that would
be encountered by mines operating under harsh conditions. EPA therefore
concludes that it adequately took into account maintenance costs in its
economic impact analysis.

<ITAG tagnum=84>3. Costs of Piping</ITAG>

The Department also contended that EPA had underestimated the length of
pipe that very small and small mines would need to recirculate water from
settling ponds to the sluice and stated that, in light of topographic conditions
and other factors, longer pumping distances ``are anticipated.'' The DOI
did not provide data to support this contention. The Department also apparently
misunderstood the length of pipe costed by EPA, which, as indicated in
the Agency's final costing study supporting the final rule, was actually
several times greater than indicated by the DOI. Moreover, EPA took into
account the topographical constraints cited by the Department by including
in its analysis the costs of building three or four small settling ponds
per year if there was not adequate space for a single large pond. Under
this scenario, less piping is obviously needed because each new pond is
constructed as close as possible to the gold recovery process. Finally,
as explained in the final Economic Impact Analysis, EPA applied a cost
factor which increased all operating costs for certain representative mines
in the analysis to reflect the higher costs of operating under difficult
topographic conditions.

<ITAG tagnum=84>4. Settling Pond Construction Costs</ITAG>

The Department also asserted that EPA had underestimated the size of settling
ponds needed to comply with the rule because the Agency allegedly overestimated
the density of solids that would be collected in the ponds after settling.
However, the Agency's estimate of 57% solids in the sludge was based upon
laboratory analysis of sludge core samples taken at seven operating settling
ponds during the 1986 mining season. The Department cited a Bureau of Mines
chemical flocculant study which apparently found a percent solids content
of 45%. However, the Bureau of Mines study was a pilot scale examination
of the performance of chemically aided settling; the study did not measure
the density of solids in settling ponds. Because EPA's analysis was performed
under actual, full-scale conditions and was specifically designed to ascertain
the percent solids in sludge produced by simple settling, the Agency is
confident that it has accurately estimated the percent solids that will
be produced under full-scale field conditions.

<ITAG tagnum=84>5. Patenting Costs</ITAG>

Several commenters asserted that EPA should have included in its analysis
the cost of mines to patent their claims. They cite in particular the Alaska
Native Claims Settlement Act and assert that miners may lose their right
to mine if the lands on which their claims are located are conveyed to
Native Villages and Regional Corporations under the Act. EPA concludes
that it properly excluded this cost from its analysis. It is well-established
that a miner does not have to patent his claim in order to maintain his
possessory mining rights.

Decisions by the Department of the Interior and the Federal courts have
clearly held a miner's right to his unpatented claims is not impaired if
lands on which his claims are located are conveyed under the Alaska Native
Claims Settlement Act. Since the decision to go to patent is therefore
discretionary and not a necessary cost of doing business, EPA appropriately
excluded it from its analysis.

<ITAG tagnum=84>6. Lower 48 Analysis</ITAG>

DOI asserted that EPA's economic analysis contains insufficient information
on mines located in the Lower 48 States. EPA disagrees with this assertion.
EPA made an intensive effort beginning in 1984 to collect data on Lower
48 mining activity. EPA prepared a model mine analysis similar to that
developed for Alaska that covers an estimated 265 mines in the Lower 48
States. The database supporting the Lower 48 analysis includes all available
data, including data from private sources (e.g., material in comments from
miners) and publicly available data (State and Federal publications, correspondence
with State and Federal agencies). The information was collected over a
period of years and was subject to public review and comment at proposal
and in two subsequent notices. EPA believes the Lower 48 analysis is based
on sufficient data and correctly states the impact of the regulation on
mines in the Lower 48 States.

<ITAG tagnum=84>7. Regional Data</ITAG>

DOI asserted that EPA's analysis contains insufficient ore grade information
on two mining regions within Alaska_the Northern and Southeastern regions.

In developing the database for the regulation, EPA undertook an exhaustive
investigation of ore grades found at mines throughout Alaska and relied
upon information collected in field questionnaires, published literature
and land patent reports to derive regional ore grade values. The Northern
and Southeastern regions of Alaska had the smallest number of ore grade
data points, which is not unexpected, since these two regions have historically
had the least mining activity. In 1986, a total of seven mines were active
in these two regions according to the State of Alaska 
<T3>Minerals Industry Yearbook 1986.</T3>

In the Northern region, EPA relied upon two data points to determine a
regional average. A data point of .016 ounce per cubic yard was obtained
from an EPA questionnaire. The other data point was based on a historic
grade of .058 ounce per cubic yard. We reduced this very high value to
.04 ounce/yard as a conservative assumption. The two data points thus yielded
an average ore grade of .028 ounce per cubic yard, which is the value used
for calculating mine revenues in the Northern region. We believe this value,
which is higher than the statewide average, is appropriate because any
mines that operate under the more difficult conditions of the Northern
region (harsh weather, long distance to suppliers, etc.) would require
higher than average ore grades and, therefore, higher than average returns
in order to cover higher than average costs. EPA notes that, consistent
with this approach, the representative model mines in the Agency's analysis
for this region were estimated to have higher operating costs due to these
difficult conditions.

In the Southeastern region, DOI incorrectly stated that EPA used the 1921
Geological Survey bulletin to obtain a regional average ore grade of .02
ounce per cubic yard. EPA was unable to obtain any ore grade data for this
region, so the state-wide weighted average ore grade of .02 was used as
a proxy for this region. This value is lower than the ore grade reported
in the USGS 1921 bulletin for Alaska. Given the small number of mines in
this region, the use of the statewide average ore grade value as a proxy
is a reasonable alternative.

In developing this regulation, EPA thoroughly searched for and used all
available information to derive ore grade values by mining region. We recognize
that the data are limited for two regions, but again point out this is
consistent with the scarcity of mines in these two areas of Alaska. The
number of ore grade data points is similarly limited in the Alaska Department
of Natural Resources database. Given the limited data, we believe that
the ore grade estimates used by the Agency are reasonable representations
of the grades at mines in these two regions.

<ITAG tagnum=84>8. Ore Grades</ITAG>

The most significant data submitted to EPA related to the ore grade values
assumed in the Agency's analysis. Ore grade assumptions form the basis
of revenue estimates and are therefore crucial to determining the effect
of this regulation on mine profitability. The DOI contended that EPA has
included ``outdated'' historical ore grade information in its database
and recommended that EPA use a single, revised ore grade value for all
mines (0.015 ounce per cubic yard) that the Department derived from a portion
of EPA's data and other data sources.

EPA has reviewed all of the data presented by the Department and has concluded
that they do not justify revising the ore grade database relied upon by
EPA in promulgating this regulation. A complete analysis of the comments
and data presented by the DOI is contained in the document ``Summary Report
on Comments and Analysis of Data Submitted After Promulgation of the Gold
Placer Mining Rule'', which is contained in the record for this decision.
A summary of EPA's analysis and conclusions is provided below.

EPA's ore grade database was derived from an exhaustive data collection
effort and is compiled from several sources. These include observations
reported in published studies which reported ore grade or other mining
data over time from which ore grade could be reported, and ore grade values
collected directly from miners by EPA during site visits in the 1984-1986
mining seasons. While some of the ore grades obtained from published literature
were collected some time ago, the Department has provided no data to substantiate
its claim that deposits with such ore grades are no longer found because
many miners are currently remining previously worked areas. Indeed, the
Agency has reexamined the recent data collected in support of the final
rule, and determined that, if the Agency were to rely 
<T3>only</T3> on the recently collected data and exclude the historical
ore grades, the economic impacts would likely be lower than projected at
promulgation because the overall statewide average of EPA's recent ore
grade data (i.e., collected after 1977), weighted according to the number
of mines operating in various regions, is actually higher than the weighted
average of the data (recent and historical) relied upon at promulgation.
Therefore, the Department's contention that use of the historic ore grades
inflated mine revenues and reduced the projected impacts of the rule is
without merit.

EPA conducted an analysis evaluating the economic impacts of this rule
if the ore grade values were lowered in the manner suggested by the DOI.
The analysis indicates that use of lower ore grades suggested by DOI results
in baseline closures of most of the gold placer mining industry (i.e.,
closures prior to the imposition of any costs to comply with this regulation).
At the 1986 season average gold price of $377 per ounce, 84% of all mines
would close in the baseline; at the 1987 season average gold price of $455,
65% of all mines would close in the baseline. However, since the number
of mines in Alaska actually increased between 1986 and 1988, we believe
that DOI's recommended ore grade value is unrealistically low, for its
projects pre-compliance closures of a significant portion of the industry
at a time when the number of mines is expanding.

EPA also evaluated whether some of the data submitted by the DOI were appropriate
for use in the Agency's analysis. Two new ore grade data sources were supplied
by the DOI: an average ore grade value from nine BLM patent reports, and
151 ore grade values that had been collected by the Alaska Department of
Natural Resources (ADNR) from 1982 to 1987. With regard to the patent reports,
the DOI did not provide EPA with the individual ore grade values from the
nine mines; nor did the Department provide the actual reports. Without
this information, EPA was unable to verify the method by which ore grades
were calculated, the sizes of the mines or their locations in order to
evaluate the accuracy of the data or its representativeness. In addition,
the Department informed EPA that it had selected the nine reports from
21 that were available, and EPA does not know the criteria that were used
in selecting only the nine reports. For these reasons, EPA does not believe
it would be appropriate to incorporate these data into its analysis.

The Agency also evaluated the survey data collected by ADNR for possible
use in EPA's analysis. After DOI submitted its comments to the Agency,
EPA solicited additional information from the ADNR regarding the mines
in the database, such as mine size, location and instances were an individual
mine reported ore grade for more than one year. However, because the survey
had been conducted under a promise of confidentiality, the actual data
could not be obtained by EPA.

For several reasons, the Agency concluded that reliance on the Alaska data
would not be appropriate. First, the data are the result of a self-selected
survey; several thousand questionnaires had been sent during the six years
but only 151 responses were received containing information sufficient
to derive ore grade values. This indicates a potential for response bias.
Also, the questionnaires did not specifically request the miner's ore grade.
The wording of relevant questions was confusing and could have caused errors
in the reporting or deriving of ore grade values. Moreover, the data appear
overly representative of large mines which, because of economies of scale,
may be able to operate profitably with lower ore grades than smaller mines.
Thus, the large number of ore grade data points from large mines introduces
the possibility of bias in the database towards lower ore grade values.
Finally, the questionnaire was designed to get an overall view of the Alaska
mineral industry, and not specifically to investigate gold placer mining
ore grades.

EPA's data collection effort, by contrast, was specifically designed to
be representative of the gold placer mining industry in a variety of respects,
including the number of mines in various size categories and locations.
Also, since EPA had its raw data in hand, the Agency was able to exercise
the quality control that it could not exercise without having the raw data
collected by ADNR. EPA therefore concluded that it was appropriate to continue
to rely upon the database collected prior to promulgation.

However, EPA also evaluated whether the Alaska data, if it were appropriate
for use by the Agency, would indicate economic impacts significantly different
from those projected by EPA at promulgation. The Alaska data, when grouped
by region and weighted according to the number of mines in each region,
yield a state-wide weighted average that is approximately 5% lower than
the state-wide weighted average of EPA's database. EPA, therefore, conducted
a sensitivity analysis that reduced the ore grade values in each region
by this amount. The most notable result of this adjustment is an increase
in the number of baseline closures. While the total number of closures
due to compliance increases slightly (from 25 to 27 mines), the Agency
does not believe that the results are significantly different from those
projected at promulgation. Therefore, the Agency has concluded that, even
if it were to rely upon the ADNR data base, EPA would conclude that the
final regulation is economically achievable for all mine size categories.

<ITAG tagnum=84>9. Conclusion</ITAG>

On the basis of its analysis of all the comments and data submitted during
the comment period, EPA concludes that no changes to its economic impact
methodology are warranted. EPA continues to believe that limitations based
upon recirculation of process wastewater are economically achievable for
all mine size categories.

<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>GSA has determined that this rule is
not a major rule for the purposes of Executive Order 12291 of February
17, 1981, because it is not likely to result in an annual effect on the
economy of $100 million or more, a major increase in costs to consumers
or others, or significant adverse effects. GSA has based all administrative
decisions underlying this rule on adequate information concerning the need
for, and consequences of, this rule; has determined that the potential
benefits to society from this rule outweigh the potential costs and has
maximized the net benefits; and has chosen the alternative approach involving
the least net cost to society.

In 41 CFR Chapter 101, the following temporary regulation is added to the
appendix at the end of Subchapter A to read as follows:

<ITAG tagnum=21>December 7, 1988.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=20>[Federal Property Management Regulations Temporary Regulation A-31]</ITAG>

TO: Heads of Federal agencies.

SUBJECT: Travel and transportation expense payment system using contractor-issued
charge cards, centrally-billed accounts, and travelers checks.

1. 
<T3>Purpose</T3>. This regulation prescribes policies and procedures for
a travel and transportation expense payment system which provides for the
use of General Services Administration (GSA) contractor-issued charge cards,
centrally-billed accounts, and travelers checks by Federal agencies for
the procurement of passenger transportation services, car rentals, payment
to commercial facilities for subsistence (Lodging, meals, etc.) and for
miscellaneous travel and transportation expenses incurred during official
travel.

2. 
<T3>Effective date</T3>. This regulation is effective November 30, 1988.

3. 
<T3>Expiration date</T3>. This regulation expires November 29, 1989, unless
sooner superseded or canceled.

4. 
<T3>Scope</T3>. This regulation shall be used in conjunction with the Federal
Travel Regulation (FTR) and 41 CFR Part 101-41. Except as provided in this
temporary regulation, all provisions of the FTR, 41 CFR Part 101-41, and
related regulations (e.g., FPMR Temporary Regulation A-30, governing use
of airline contract fares) continue in effect.

5. 
<T3>Applicability. </T3>a. This regulation applies to employees of Federal
agencies and departments that participate in GSA's travel and transportation
expense payment system using contractor-issued charge cards, centrally-billed
accounts, and travelers checks.

b. Except for the use of contractor-issued charge cards, this regulation
permits eligible cost-reimbursable contractors working for the Government
to participate in GSA's travel and transportation expense payment system.

6. 
<T3>Background. </T3>a. Under 41 CFR 101-41.203, Federal agencies normally
use a U.S. Government Transportation Request (GTR), SF 1169, to purchase
passenger transportation services directly from a common carrier or through
a commercial travel agent under contract to GSA. Also, under the FTR, travelers
are eligible for advances to pay for allowable travel expenses. Upon completion
of official travel, the employee submits a travel voucher to the agency
finance office, which reimburses the employee for authorized and allowable
travel expenses. 

b. Authority to deviate from 41 CFR 101-41.203 was granted by the Administrator
of General Services on August 4, 1983, thus allowing eligible individuals
to participate in the charge card program. (See 48 FR 36893, dated August
15, 1983.) 

c. GSA entered into a new contract with Citibank/Dinners Club, Inc., to
issue and maintain charge cards and establish centrally-billed accounts.
GSA also contracted with Citicorp for the issuance of travelers checks
to be used by Federal employees to cover subsistence and other allowable
travel and minor transportation expenses. Those contracts are effective
November 30, 1988. 

d. For more effective cash management, the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB) Bulletin 88-17 dated July 22, 1988, prescribes that agencies should
advance travel funds in the form of travelers checks, when determined to
be in the best interest of the Government. 

7. 
<T3>Definitions. </T3>For the purposes of this regulation, certain terms
used herein are defined as follows: 

a. ``Centrally-billed'' means a Government Travel System account established
by the contractor at the request of a participating agency. 

b. A ``charge card'' means a Citibank/Diners Club charge card to be used
by travelers of a participating agency to pay for passenger transportation
services, commercial facilities for subsistence expenses, and other allowable
travel and transportation expenses incurred in connection with official
travel. 

c. ``Contractor'' means Citibank/Diners Club, Inc. 

d. ``Cost-reimbursable contractor'' means contractors performing work under
cost-reimbursable contracts or other eligible contracts as defined in 48
CFR Part 51, including (but not limited to): 

(1) Contractors working under cost-reimbursable contracts or other types
of contracts involving direct travel costs to the Government; and 

(2) Contractors working for the Government at specific sites under special
arrangements with the applicable contracting agency, and which are funded
at such sites through congressional appropriations (e.g., Government-owned,
contractor operated (GOCO), federally funded research and development (FFRDC),
or management and operating (M&amp;O) contracts). 

e. ``FTD'' means the Federal Travel Directory, a monthly publication issued
by GSA and the Department of Defense to provide up-to-date information
on charge cards, contract fares, lodging rates, car rental, per diem rates,
travel management centers, and other travel and transportation matters.
Government employees should order copies of the FTD through their appropriate
headquarters administrative offices. The FTD is also available from the
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington,
DC 20402. For ordering information, telephone the central order desk on
(202) 783-3238 and request the Federal Travel Directory, GPO stock number
722-006-00000-3. 

f. ``Participating agency'' means agencies and departments that participate
in GSA's travel and transportation expense payment system. 

g. ``Travelers checks'' are Citicorp travelers checks. 

h. ``TMC'' means a Travel Management Center. A TMC is a commercial travel
firm under contract to GSA that provides reservations, ticketing, and related
travel management services for official Government travelers. 

8. 
<T3>Travel and transportation expense program. </T3>This GSA travel management
program incorporates provisions for the following: 

a. Individual employee charge cards used to pay for major travel and transportation
expenses; i.e., passenger transportation tickets, vehicle rental charges,
lodgings, meals, etc. (see par. 9);

b. Centrally-billed accounts used by designated agency offices primarily
for the purchase of passenger transportation services (see par. 12); and
c. Travelers checks (or cash) used for other expenses; i.e., laundry, parking,
local transportation, or tips (see par. 14). 

9. 
<T3>Individual employee charge cards.</T3>_a. 
<T3>Issuing charge cards. </T3>Participating agencies shall determine and
name employees who may be issued an individual employee charge card. The
employees will be requested to complete an employee card account application
for agency approval and submission to the contractor. The charge card is
issued directly to the employee in his or her name. Cost-reimbursable contractors
are not eligible to use the charge card. 

b. 
<T3>Use of charge cards. </T3>

(1) The employee shall use charge cards issued under this program only
for expenses incurred in conjunction with official travel. The employee
shall use the charge card to pay for official travel expenses to the maximum
extent possible. There is no preset expense limit on the charge cards.
Although the employee is liable for payment of all charges incurred, the
employee shall be reimbursed by his/her agency for all authorized and allowable
travel and transportation expenses. However, employees are cautioned that
charges in excess of authorized and allowable travel and transportation
expenses, i.e., lodging and meal costs which exceed authorized amounts,
are the financial responsibility of the employee and are not reimbursable.
Use of the charge card does not relieve the employee of the responsibility
to employ prudent travel practices and to observe rules and regulations
governing official travel as set forth in the FTR and implementing agency
regulations. 

(2) The charge card may be used to pay for passenger transportation services
(including services under contract fares offered by carriers under contract
to GSA) at the transportation carrier's ticket counter, TMC, or agency
travel office, as appropriate, under the participating agency's policies
and procedures. Agencies may elect to prohibit employees from using the
charge card to purchase services directly from a carrier. The charge card
shall not be used to procure travel and transportation services from commercial
travel agencies that are not under contract to the Government to provide
such services to the Government traveler. 

c. 
<T3>Monthly contractor bills and payments. </T3>The terms of the contract
with Citibank/Diners Club, Inc., require billing and payment to be performed
in the following manner. The contractor bills charges directly to the individual
employee each month. Charges billed to the individual employer are due
and must be paid in full within 25 calendar days of the billing date. There
are no interest or late charges, and extended or partial payment is not
permitted. Questions concerning billings and payments should be directed
to the contractor at: 800-525-5289 or 303-799-9000. 

d. 
<T3>Travel voucher claims.</T3>_(1) 
<T3>Preparing and submitting travel vouchers. </T3>Upon completing official
travel, the employee must prepare and submit a travel voucher in the usual
manner to be reimbursed under the FTR and agency policies and procedures,
together with any required receipts, to the appropriate finance or paying
office. The employee is reimbursed for authorized and allowable travel
and transportation expenses. Participating agencies shall process travel
vouchers within the time limits prescribed in OMB Bulletin 88-17 of July
22, 1988. 

2. 
<T3>Unused transportation tickets. </T3>Unused or partially unused tickets
purchased with individual charge cards shall be returned to a TMC or carrier
and a refund credit receipt obtained. Unused tickets that have been prepaid
for pickup at the airport must be refunded by the airline upon whose ticket
stock the ticket was issued. The employee may claim reimbursement on the
travel voucher only for the cost of the tickets actually used. Refunds
for unused tickets will be credited to the employee's account. The unused
tickets shall not be submitted with the travel voucher. 

(3) 
<T3>Transportation charges and assignment of rights. </T3>Use of charge
cards for purchase of passenger transportation services is considered to
be a cash purchase. Travel vouchers submitted for reimbursement of transportation
purchase with charge cards must include a statement which assigns to the
United States all rights which the traveler has in connection with recovery
of overcharges from the carrier(s). This statement is preprinted on the
SF 1012, Travel Voucher, and must be initialed by the employee when claiming
reimbursement for transportation expenses. Employees using agency travel
vouchers under approved exceptions to the SF 1012 must add this statement
if it is not preprinted on the voucher.

10. 
<T3>Charge card cancellation or suspension. </T3>Charge cards may be canceled
by the employee, the participating agency, or the contractor. Cancellation
may be accomplished by telephone notification with subsequent written confirmation
to the contractor. The contractor may cancel an employee's card when the
contractor's statement has not been paid in full 120 calendar days after
the date the statement was issued. The contractor may suspend an employee's
card when the contractor's statement has not been paid in full 60 calendar
days after the date the statement was issued. In either event, the contractor
will cancel or suspend an employee's card only on notification to and with
the concurrence of the participating agency. 

II. 
<T3>Lost or stolen charge cards. </T3> An employee is not responsible for
any charges incurred against a lost or stolen charge card provided the
employee promptly reports loss of the card to the contractor under the
terms of the cardmember agreement signed by the employee when the charge
card was issued. Employees may call the following telephone numbers 24
hours a day to report lost or stolen charge cards:

In the continental U.S., Alaska, Hawaii, and Virgin Islands (toll free)
1-800-525-9040

<ITAG tagnum=15>In Canada (call collect) 0-303-779-8235</ITAG>
<ITAG tagnum=15>In Puerto Rico (call collect) 37-800-525-9040</ITAG>
<ITAG tagnum=15>In the Caribbean 0-809-295-7181</ITAG>
<ITAG tagnum=15>In Colorado (except Denver) (toll free) 1-800-332-9340</ITAG>
<ITAG tagnum=15>In metropolitan Denver (dial direct) 779-8235/779-1505</ITAG>

These telephone numbers are also published in the FTD.

12. 
<T3>Participating agency centrally-billed accounts.</T3>_a. 
<T3>Establishment.</T3> (1) Participating agencies may establish centrally-billed
accounts with the contractor for one or more designated offices within
the agency to primarily purchase transportation services, principally for
groups or for infrequent travelers; i.e., employees not designated to receive
individual cards. Agencies shall ensure that only authorized personnel
use the accounts and that all tickets purchased are authorized. Charge
cards are not issued for centrally-billed accounts.

(2) The Federal agency may also allow centrally-billed accounts to be established
for use by eligible cost-reimbursable Government contractors. These accounts
must be established at the specific request of the agency and are subject
to approval by GSA's contracting officer.

b. 
<T3>Use of centrally-billed accounts. </T3>Centrally-billed accounts may
be used only if agencies use a TMC or an agency travel office. They are
intended principally to supplement the individual card, rather than as
the sole means of purchasing airline tickets for all agency employees.

c. 
<T3>Contractor billing and payment. </T3>Consolidated contractor airline
ticket charges accrued through use of centrally-billed accounts shall be
billed monthly to the agency's finance and paying office. Expenses billed
monthly against centrally-billed accounts are paid to the contractor. Monthly
payment of charges incurred through the use of centrally-billed accounts
is subject to the provisions of the Prompt Payment Act of 1982, and charges
billed to agency offices are due in full within 30 calendar days of the
billing date.

d. 
<T3>Travel voucher claims.</T3>_(1) 
<T3>Preparation and submission of travel vouchers.</T3> On completing official
travel, the employee shall prepare and submit a travel voucher in the usual
manner, together with any required receipts, to the finance and paying
office, to be reimbursed.

(2) 
<T3>Unused transportation tickets.</T3> The employee shall submit to the
appropriate agency office all unused transportation tickets (wholly or
partially unused) purchased under a centrally-billed account. In turn,
the agency shall return the unused tickets to the TMC through use of the
SF 1170, Redemption of Unused Tickets, and maintain a copy of the SF 1170
on file until the credit appears as an adjustment to the agency's bill
from the TMC. Policies and procedures regarding the use of the SF 1170
are provided in 41 CFR Subpart 101-41.2.

13. 
<T3>Financial obligations/liability.</T3>_a. 
<T3>Employee. </T3>Except for charges accrued against promptly reported
lost or stolen cards, employees with charge cards are liable for all billed
charges (see pars. 9b and 11). Government employees must pay their just
financial debts under section 206 of Executive Order 11222 (May 8, 1965)
and Office of Personnel Management Regulations, 5 CFR 735.207. At the request
of the contractor, Federal agencies and departments, without Government
liability, may assist in collecting delinquent employee accounts after
60 calendar days.

b. 
<T3>Government. </T3>The Government assumes no liability for charges incurred
on employee charge cards, nor is the Government liable for lost or stolen
charge cards. The Government is liable only for authorized charges incurred
in conjunction with official travel on centrally-billed accounts.

14. 
<T3>Travelers checks. </T3>Travelers checks issued under this program are
available to participating agencies in denominations of $20, $50, $100,
$500, and $1,000. Specific arrangements for issuing, shipping, and paying
for bulk stocks of travelers checks are made during initial discussions
between Citicorp and the participating agency.

15. 
<T3>Lost or stolen travelers checks. </T3>Lost or stolen travelers checks
shall be reported promptly by telephone to Citicorp. Employee may call
the following numbers 24 hours a day to report lost or stolen travelers
checks and to obtain refund information:

<T3>Additional agency guidance and information.</T3>_a. 
<T3>Purchasing passenger transportation.</T3> (1) Passenger transportation
services procured with contractor-issued charge cards under this payment
system are exempt from the cash limitation established by the Administrator
of General Services at 41 CFR 101-41.203-2. Any credit card other than
the contractor-issued charge card, and all travelers checks used to purchase
passenger transportation services shall be considered the equivalent of
cash and subject to the cash limitation and provisions of 41 CFR 101-41.203-2.

(2) The portion of the charge card application form, Optional Employee
Data, Field 2, is to be used to record the standard Federal organization
code(s) contained in the Department of Commerce/National Bureau of Standards
publication, Codes for the Identification of Federal and Federally-assisted
Organizations (FIPS PUB 95), dated December 23, 1982. Specific details
concerning this requirement will be communicated by the contractor directly
to each participating agency during the initial program implementation
phase.

b. 
<T3>Submitting passenger ticketing information to GSA for audit. </T3>(1)
Travel vouchers containing reimbursable transportation charges purchased
with contractor-issued charge cards shall not be considered transportation
vouchers under 41 CFR 101-41.807.

(2) Passenger ticketing information is furnished directly by the contractor
to GSA's Office of Transportation Audits. It is used to identify and collect
carrier overcharges.

c. 
<T3>Examination of payments and collection. </T3>The Transportation Act
of 1940, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3726), authorizes the GSA Transportation
Audit Division (see 41 CFR 101-41.102) to issue a notice of overcharge
when GSA finds that a carrier has been overpaid for the services rendered.

(1) Under the provisions of 41 CFR Subpart 101-41.5, carriers are requested
to refund amounts due the United States. Refund checks are to be made payable
to the General Services Administration and mailed promptly to General Services
Administration, P.O. Box 93746, Chicago, IL 60673. Payment or credit to
the contractor is not considered proper payment of overcharge claims due
the U.S. Government.

(2) Protests to notices of overcharge are handled and processed in accordance
with 41 CFR 101-41.503.

(3) Collection of unrefunded overcharges owed to the U.S. Government are
processed in accordance with 41 CFR 101-41.504.

<T2>ACTION: </T2>Notice of final 1989 fishery specifications.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>NOAA announces the final 1989 specifications for Pacific
coast groundfish taken in the ocean off the coasts of Washington, Oregon,
and California. The specifications include the acceptable biological catch,
the optimum yield, and the distribution of the optimum yield between domestic
and foreign fishing operations as required by the regulations implementing
the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. The intended effect
of this action is to establish allowable harvests of Pacific coast groundfish
from the United States exclusive economic zone and territorial waters in
1989.

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The implementing regulations for the
Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) at 50 CFR Part 663
require that management specifications for groundfish be evaluated each
calendar year, that preliminary specifications for the upcoming year be
published in the 
<T4>Federal Register</T4> inviting public comment, and that final specifications
be published in the 
<T4>Federal Register</T4> following public comment. The management specifications
include the acceptable biological catch (ABC), the optimum yield (OY),
and the distribution of OY between domestic and foreign fishermen. The
ABC is an estimate of the annual catch that can be taken of the more than
80 groundfish species managed by the FMP without jeopardizing the stock's
productivity. The OY, which is specified for six species (Pacific whiting,
sablefish, Pacific ocean perch, shortbelly rockfish, widow rockfish, and,
north of 39&degrees; N. latitude, jack mackerel), is based on socio-economic
as well as biological factors and thus is not necessarily equal to the
ABC. The OYs for these six species are the maximum amounts of fish (in
round weight) that may be retained or landed each year from the 3-200 nautical
mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and the territorial sea (0-3 nautical
miles) off Washington, Oregon, and California.

The OY for each of these six species is apportioned into specifications
of the amounts available for domestic and foreign fishing. The domestic
annual harvest (DAH) consists of estimates of domestic annual processing
(DAP) and joint venture processing (JVP) which are verified by surveys
of the domestic industry in September and June. The total allowable level
of foreign fishing (TALFF) is the remainder, if any, of OY after domestic
needs have been subtracted. Before TALFF is designated, a reserve of 20
percent of OY is established for each species in case the domestic industry
needs more fish than initially was estimated.

The other groundfish species managed under the FMP do not have numerical
OYs. For the most part, they cannot be harvested selectively and, unless
biological stress is documented, have not been managed by quotas. The fisheries
may be regulated by gear, area, and catch restrictions. Full utilization
by domestic processors of some species in this multispecies complex preclude
joint venture of foreign targeting on underexploited species in the complex
because large incidental catches of the fully utilized species are likely
to result. Consequently, specifications for DAH, DAP, JVP, and TALFF are
not made for species which do not have numerical OYs. However, ABCs are
specified for the major species or species groups.

The OYs may be changed during the year, within limits, under the procedures
outlined in the regulations at 50 CFR 663.22. The estimates of DAP, DAH,
JVP, and TALFF also may be modified inseason according to the procedures
outlined in the foreign fishing regulations at 50 CFR 611.70.

The Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) reviewed the recommendations
of its Groundfish Management Team (GMT) and Scientific and Statistical
Committee, received public comment, and recommended preliminary specifications
for the 1989 ABCs, based upon the best available scientific information
and surveys of the industry, at its September 1988 meeting. The preliminary
1989 ABCs and OYs recommended by the Council were published in the 
<T4>Federal Register</T4> at 53 FR 46890 (November 21, 1988). Written public
comments on the preliminary specifications were requested through December
1, 1988; none were received.

The Council again received public comment at its November 16-17, 1988 meeting,
the last opportunity in 1988 to recommend final specifications for 1989.
The Council considered public comments in addition to advice from its Groundfish
Advisory Subpanel (industry and consumer representatives) and GMT (state
and federal fishery biologists and an economist) in recommending final
specifications to NMFS. The Council recommended the following revisions
to the preliminary specifications for sablefish, widow rockfish, and Pacific
cod in 1989.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Sablefish</ITAG>

The ABC for sablefish in 1989 is 9,000 metric tons (mt). At its November
meeting, the Council changed its earlier recommendation for a 1989 sablefish
OY from 10,400 mt to an OY range of 10,400 mt-11,000 mt and stated its
intent to manage for the low end of the range. This 600 mt potential increase
in landings is intended to provide for uncertainties in landings projections
for trawl and nontrawl gears, enable some small fisheries that operate
later in the year to land small amounts of sablefish after gear allocations
have been achieved, and allow for landings of sablefish caught incidentally
while fishing for other species. However, if total landings reach the upper
end of the OY range of 11,000 mt, all further landings of sablefish will
be prohibited. This strategy, in conjunction with specific management measures
designed to slow the rate of landings (published in a separate 
<T4>Federal Register</T4> notice), is intended to reduce the probability
of a fishery closure early in the year, and will thus reduce the waste
of incidentally caught sablefish which must be discarded after a quota
is reached.

A similar OY range (9,200-10,800 mt) was adopted in 1988. The Council intended
to manage for the 10,000 mt ABC (allocated 52 percent for trawl gear and
48 percent for nontrawl gear), and provided an additional 800 mt to be
used, if needed, to allow for landings of sablefish caught incidentally
in the trawl fishery after the trawl allocation was reached. Although the
800 mt reserve was added to the trawl allocation in August, inseason management
measures slowed total landings to a projected 10,000 mt in 1988.

Although the OY range of 10,400-11,000 mt is higher than the 9,000 mt ABC
in 1989, it is not expected to result in overfishing because the stock
is larger than the biomass level which will produce the estimated 8,200
mt maximum sustainable yield (MSY). If 10,400 mt of sablefish are taken
in 1989, then the yield may be reduced in increments of a few hundred metric
tons a year over 7 years, at which time the biomass and the yield will
have converged to MSY levels. If 11,000 mt of sablefish are taken in 1989,
then the convergence to MSY would be achieved in about 5 years. 

Because domestic processors intend to process all available sablefish,
DAP and DAH are equal to OY. No sablefish are available for joint venture
or foreign fishing except for small incidental catches. 

<ITAG tagnum=84>Widow Rockfish </ITAG>

The preliminary 1989 ABC and OY for widow rockfish both were proposed to
be 9,500 metric tons (mt), 21 percent below the 1988 ABC and OY of 12,100
mt. Because two stock assessment models produced different results and
because it was not clear what the current level of the stock was in relation
to MSY, the preliminary specifications for ABC and OY were based on the
average estimated MSY from the two stock assessment models. 

New information, made available after the preliminary specifications were
recommended by the Council, indicates that the stock is at or above the
MSY levels estimated by the two previous models, and that an ABC of 12,400
mt, the average ABC derived by the two models, may be more appropriate
for 1989. Accordingly, the final ABC for widow rockfish in 1989 is 12,400
mt, 300 mt higher than in 1988. As proposed in the preliminary specifications,
OY equals ABC. Because domestic processors intend to process all available
widow rockfish, DAP and DAH equal OY. No widow rockfish are available for
joint venture or foreign fishing except for small incidental catches. 

<ITAG tagnum=84>Pacific Cod </ITAG>

Because there is no formal stock assessment for Pacific cod, the ABC for
this species has always been determined by the highest catch on record.
The most recent information, unavailable at the time the preliminary specifications
were proposed, projects 1988 coastwide landings of 3,200 mt. Because landings
information now are available coastwide (which was not the case when the
previous ABC for Pacific cod was estimated), the GMT recommended that the
ABC for Pacific cod be applied coastwide rather than only for the Vancouver
and Columbia areas as previously was the case. Accordingly, the ABC for
Pacific cod is increased 100 mt, from 3,100 mt to 3,200 mt, and applied
coastwide. (Footnotes 2 and 6 of Table 1 therefore are modified to delete
reference to Pacific cod.) Pacific cod does not have a numerical OY quota
and therefore has no specifications for JVP or TALFF. 

All other ABC and OY designations for 1989 remain as proposed in the preliminary
specifications at 53 FR 46890 (November 21, 1988). In particular, no changes
are made to the specifications for Pacific whiting. The entire 225,000
mt OY for Pacific whiting will be utilized by the domestic industry, 18,000
mt for shore-based processing and 207,000 mt for joint venture operations.
Domestic needs will be reevaluated in June, and Pacific whiting surplus
to domestic needs could be made available for foreign fishing near August
1, 1989. However, the establishment of a foreign fishery for Pacific whiting
in 1989 does not appear likely at this time. 

After considering this information, the Secretary of Commerce concurs with
the Council's recommendations including the revisions stated above, and
in the absence of other public comment announces the final specifications
for 1989 as shown in Tables 1 and 2.

<ITAG tagnum=85>Budget Rent A Car Corp.; Agreement Containing Consent Order to Cease
and Desist</ITAG>

The Federal Trade Commission having initiated an investigation of certain
acts and practices of Budget Rent A Car Corporation, hereinafter sometimes
referred to as proposed respondent, and it now appearing that the proposed
respondent is willing to enter into an agreement containing an order to
cease and desist from the use of the acts and practices being investigated.

It is hereby agreed by and between Budget Rent A Car Corporation, by its
duly authorized officers, and counsel for the Federal Trade Commission
that:

1. Proposed respondent, Budget Rent A Car Corporation, is a corporation
organized, existing and doing business under and by virtue of the laws
of the State of Delaware, with its office and principal place of business
located at 200 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60601. Budget Rent
A Car Systems, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Budget Rent A Car Corporation,
is a corporation organized, existing and doing business under and by virtue
of the laws of the State of Delaware, with its office and principal place
of business located at 200 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60601.
For purposes of this agreement, the term ``Proposed respondent'' or ``respondent''
shall mean Budget Rent a Car Corporation and shall include Budget Rent
A Car Systems, Inc.

2. Proposed respondent admits all the jurisdictional facts set forth in
the draft of the complaint attached hereto.

3. Proposed respondent waives:

(a) Any further procedural steps;

(b) The requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement
of findings of fact and conclusions of law;

(c) All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest
the validity of the order entered pursuant to this agreement; and

(d) Any claim under the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5 U.S.C. 504.

4. Proposed respondent retains all rights, including those rights provided
by Section 5(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(b), and 16 CFR 2.51, 3.71
and 3.72, to petition the Commission to modify or set aside the Order due
to changes in conditions of law or fact which may include, but shall not
be limited to, recommended changes to an automobile manufacturer's regular
vehicle preventative maintenance schedules for its vehicles; provided,
however, that this provision shall not be interpreted to require the Commission
to modify or set aside the Order on any particular ground.

5. This agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding
unless and until it is accepted by the Commission. If this agreement is
accepted by the Commission, it, together with the proposed complaint contemplated
thereby, will be placed on the public record for a period of sixty (60)
days and information in respect thereto publicly released. The Commission
thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so
notify the proposed respondent, in which event it will take such action
as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint (in such
form as the circumstances may require) and decision, in disposition of
the proceeding.

6. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute
an admission by proposed respondent that the law has been violated as alleged
in the proposed complaint attached hereto. Proposed respondent denies that
any law has been violated as alleged in the complaint attached hereto.

7. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission,
and if such acceptance is not subsequently withdrawn by the Commission
pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules, the
Commission may, without further notice to proposed respondent, (1) issue
its complaint corresponding in form and substance with the proposed complaint
attached hereto and its decision containing the following order to cease
and desist in disposition of the proceeding and (2) make information public
in respect thereto. When so entered, the order to cease and desist shall
have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified or set aside
in the same force and effect and may be altered, modified or set aside
in the same manner and within the same time provided by statute for other
orders. The order shall become final upon service. Delivery by the U.S.
Postal Service of the complaint and decision containing the agreed-to order
to proposed respondent's address as stated in this agreement shall constitute
service. Proposed respondent waives any right it may have to any other
manner of service. The complaint may be used in construing the terms of
the order, and no agreement, understanding, representation, or interpretation
not contained in the order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict
the terms of the order.

8. Proposed respondent has read the proposed complaint and order contemplated
hereby. It understands that once the order has been issued, it will be
required to file one or more compliance reports showing that it has fully
complied with the order. Proposed respondent further understands that it
may be liable for civil penalties in the amount provided by law for each
violation of the order after it becomes final.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Order</ITAG>

For the purpose of this Order, the following definitions shall apply:

1. ``Affected vehicles'' means respondent's rental fleet vehicles that
are covered by recall notices received by respondent.

2. ``Rental fleet vehicles'' means those vehicles that respondent's corporate
owned locations rent to the public. 

3. ``Manufacturer'' means any person or entity engaged in the manufacturing
or assembling of motor vehicles. 

4. ``Recall notice'' means written notification from manufacturers to owners
under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. 1391
<T3>et seq., </T3>and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder,
49 CFR Part 577, that their vehicles may contain safety-related defects.
5. ``Reasonable period of time'' means a period of time not to exceed 120
days from the date the affected vehicle's notice of safety recall was received
by respondent. 
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>I. 

It is ordered that respondent Budget Rent A Car Corporation, a corporation,
its successors and assigns, and respondent's officers, agents, representatives
and employees, directly or through any corporate or other device, in connection
with respondent's corporate owned locations' advertising, offering for
rental, or rental of any rental fleet vehicle in or affecting commerce,
as ``commerce'' is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act, do forthwith
cease and desist from failing within a reasonable period of time after
receipt of a recall notice, to inspect or to have inspected each such affected
vehicle and to repair or to have repaired each such affected vehicle found
to contain the safety defect(s); provided, however, that failure to comply
with respect to any specific affected vehicle shall not be deemed to be
a violation of this Order if respondent can demonstrate that such failure
to comply was due to circumstances beyond its control, including, but not
limited to, the unavailability of replacement parts to complete that affected
vehicle's safety recall procedures, and if respondent can show that, upon
learning of such failure to comply, it complied at the earliest practicable
date. 
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>II. 

It is further ordered that respondent may elect, in lieu of the obligations
set forth in Part I of this Order, to disclose, in a clear and conspicuous
manner, to each prospective renter of an affected vehicle, that the affected
vehicle is subject to a recall notice and has not been inspected or repaired.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>III.

It is further ordered that for a period of two (2) years, respondent shall
maintain at the place said documents are routinely kept and upon request
make available to the Federal Trade Commission for inspection and copying:
1. Any recall notice received subsequent to the date of this Order and
records sufficient to show the date or dates it was received from the manufacturer;
2. Records disclosing the vehicle identification number, make and model
of every affected vehicle; and 

3. Documents evidencing the inspection and, if required, the repair of
affected vehicles. 
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>IV. 

It is further ordered that respondent shall:

It is further ordered that respondent shall notify the Commission at least
thirty (30) days prior to any proposed change in the corporate respondent
such as dissolution, assignment or sale resulting in the emergence of a
successor corporation, the creation or dissolution of subsidiaries, or
any other change in the corporation which may affect compliance obligations
arising out of this Order.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>VI.

It is further ordered that respondent shall, within one hundred twenty
(120) days after the date of service upon it of this Order, file with the
Commission a report, in writing, setting forth in detail the manner and
form in which it has complied with this Order.

<ITAG tagnum=85>Analysis of Proposed Consent Order to Aid Public Comment</ITAG>

The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement to proposed consent
order from Budget Rent A Car Corporation, (``Budget'') 200 North Michigan
Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60601. Budget is the fourth largest automobile
rental firm in the United States. The company primarily offers car and
truck rental services to the general public.

The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty
(60) days for receipt of comments by interested persons. Comments received
during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty days,
the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received,
and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final
the agreement's proposed order.

The complaint charges Budget with failing to disclose to renters that it
did not inspect, within a reasonable period of time, vehicles that were
subject to recall notices.

The proposed consent order would prohibit Budget from failing to inspect
and, if appropriate, repair its rental vehicles within a reasonable period
of time in response to manufacturers' safety recall notices. Part I of
the Order would require Budget to inspect and, if appropriate, repair each
vehicle subject to a safety notice within a reasonable period of time,
not to exceed 120 days, after receipt of that vehicle's recall notice.

Part II of the proposed consent order would give Budget the option to generally
disclose to prospective renters, in a clear and conspicuous manner, that
their cars are subject to a safety recall notice and may contain safety-related
defects, if it chooses not to inspect.

Part III of the proposed consent order would require Budget to maintain,
for a period of two years after each recall, copies of recall notice received
from a manufacturer; records showing the vehicle identification, make and
model of each affected vehicle; and documents evidencing inspection and,
if required, the repair of affected vehicles.

Part IV of the proposed consent order would also require Budget to distribute
a copy of the order to each of its officers and any employees who have
responsibilities in connection with Budget's recall inspection procedures.
It would require Budget also to distribute a copy of the proposed consent
order to all its existing and future U.S. licensees. Finally, the proposed
order would require Budget to notify the Commission at least thirty (30)
days prior to any proposed change in its corporate structure and to file
a compliance report within 120 days after service of the order.

The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed
order; it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the
agreement and proposed order, or to modify their terms in any way.

<ITAG tagnum=56>Procedures Relating to Appeals of Denial of Requests for Confidential
Treatment, Notification of Intent to Use Certain Equipment at Hearings,
and Notification to Submitters of Confidential Business Information of
a Request Under the Freedom of Information Act </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>AGENCY: </T2>International Trade Commission.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>ACTION: </T2>Notice of proposed rulemaking and request for comments.
 </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>The U.S. International Trade Commission is considering
adopting the following proposed rules relating to (1) the definition of
the term ``confidential business information; (2) information and argumentation
presented in conjunction with appeals to the Commission of denials of requests
for confidential treatment; (3) notification of intent to use audio-visual
or other equipment at hearings; and (4) notification to submitters of confidential
business information of a request for disclosure of such information under
the Freedom of Information Act. 

The proposed rules, if adopted, would amend &Section; 201.6 (relating to
confidential business information), &Section; 201.13 (relating to conduct
of nonadjudicative hearings), and &Section;&Section; 201.18-201.19 (relating
to denials of requests for information under the Freedom of Information
Act and appeals thereof) of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure
(19 CFR 201.6, 201.13, 201.18, and 201.19). Present &Section; 201.19, which
relates to appeals from denial of requests for records, would be combined
with present &Section; 201.18, which relates to denial of requests for
records. New &Section; 201.18 would be entitled ``Denial of requests, appeals
from denial''. 

Promulgation of new rules with respect to notification to submitters of
confidential business information, the fourth item identified above, is
required by Executive Order 12600 of June 23, 1987 (52 FR 23781). The proposed
rules largely reflect longstanding Commission practice and parallel final
rules issued by the Department of Justice and published in the 
<T4>Federal Register </T4>of July 19, 1988 (53 FR 27161).
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received not later than February 2, 1989.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E
Street SW., Washington, DC 20436.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>William W. Gearhart, Esq., Assistant
General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW.,
Washington, DC 20436, telephone 202-252-1091.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Commission's part 201 rules are
of general application. The Commission's rules concerning requests for
confidential treatment of business information are set forth in &Section;
201.6, rules concerning conduct of nonadjudicative hearings are set forth
in &Section; 201.13, and rules relating to requests for agency records
under the Freedom of Information Act are set forth in &Section;&Section;
201.17-201.20.

None of the proposed amendments constitutes a ``major rule'' within the
meaning of Executive Order No. 12291 (Improving Government Regulations).
the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), do
not apply. 

<T3>Definition of term ``confidential business information''. </T3>The
first of the amendments would make clear the fact that ``proprietary information''
in section 777(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1677f(b)) is the
equivalent of ``confidential business information'' in &Section; 201.6(a)
of the rules. The term ``proprietary'' in section 777(b) was substituted
for ``confidential'' by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 to ``clarify that the
reference always is to sensitive company commercial and financial data
rather than national security information at the `confidential' level.''
Mudge Rose Guhrie Alexander &amp; Ferdon v. U.S. International Trade Commission
(Civil Action No. 87-5312, May 20, 1988, D.C. Cir.). Section 777(b) provides
for the submission and nondisclosure (except under limited circumstances)
of proprietary information submitted to the Commission in connection with
investigations conducted under the antidumping and countervailing duty
laws (19 U.S.C. 1671 et seq.). Section 1886(a)(13)(A) of the Tax Reform
Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-514, 100 Stat. 2922) substituted the terms ``proprietary'',
``non-proprietary'', and ``proprietary status'' for the terms ``confidential'',
``nonconfidential'', and ``confidentiality'' in section 777(b) and changed
the title of section 777(b) to ``proprietary information'' from ``confidential
information''. 

<T3>Appeals of denials of requests for confidential treatment.</T3> The
second of the amendments would add to the end of &Section; 201.6(e) a new
paragraph (3) providing that, (i) in the case of an appeal to the Commission
of a denial by the Secretary or Acting Secretary of a request for confidential
treatment, that justification for confidential treatment submitted to the
Commission by the appealing party with the appeal shall be limited to that
submitted to the Secretary; (ii) when the Secretary or Acting Secretary
has denied a request for confidential treatment on the ground that the
submitter failed to provide adequate justification, the submitter may file
any such additional justification with the Secretary as part of an amended
request for confidential treatment; and (iii) with respect to the 20-day
period for filing an appeal set forth in paragraph (1) of &Section; 201.6(e),
that such period be considered to recommence as of the date any amended
request had been denied, or approval or denial had not been forthcoming
within 10 days of the filing of the amended request.

The Commission's present rules provide that requests for confidential treatment
shall be submitted to the Secretary and that appeals shall be filed with
the Chairman for consideration by the full Commission. However, present
Commission rules are silent on the question of whether an appellant may
submit additional justification with his appeal. It is estimated that about
half the appeals filed in recent years have contained justification in
addition to that submitted to or considered by the Secretary. In many cases
it appears that the Secretary would have granted the request if he had
considered the additional justification. As a result, the Commission has
frequently become, in effect, a first level rather than second level reviewer
of requests for confidential treatment. This submitting of new justification
to the Commission unnecessarily adds to the time it takes to dispose of
a request (under the rules appeals are decided by the Commissioners in
20 working days, but initial requests are disposed of by the Secretary
in 10 working days), unnecessarily adds to the Commissioners' dockets,
and deprives submitters of a level of agency review (the second level of
review effectively becomes the Federal courts).

<T3>Notification of intent to use certain equipment at hearings.</T3> Section
201.13 of the rules would be amended by adding at the end thereof a new
subsection (1) that would direct parties wishing to use audio-visual equipment,
easels, and other equipment in the course of their hearing presentation
to advise the Secretary that they intend to use such equipment at least
three (3) days in advance of the hearing. Parties in recent years have
increasingly used such equipment in their hearing presentations.

Notification to the Secretary would (1) facilitate the conduct of hearings
by giving the Secretary advance notice of the number and kinds of equipment
to be used in order that he might anticipate and coordinate setups, (2)
enable the Secretary to determine in advance whether Commission facilities
can accommodate the equipment, and (3) enable the Secretary to advise parties
as to the availability of Commission equipment, thus obviating the need
in some instances for parties to bring their own equipment.

<T3>Notification to submitters of business information of a request for
such information under the Freedom of Information Act.</T3> Executive Order
12600 of June 23, 1987 (52 FR 23781) requires that agencies publish rules
with respect to notification to submitters of confidential business information
of requests for such information under the Freedom of Information Act (5
U.S.C. 552). The proposed Commission rules, to be set forth in a revised
&Section; 201.19 of the Commission's rules, would provide for such notification,
parallel rules issued by the U.S. Department of Justice and published in
the 
<T4>Federal Register</T4> of July 19, 1988 (53 FR 27161), and largely reflect
existing agency practice.

<ITAG tagnum=80>&Section; 201.6 </ITAG>
<ITAG tagnum=89>[Amended]</ITAG>

2. Section 201.6(a) is amended by removing the designations ``(1)'' and
``(2)'' and by adding the following sentence to the end of the paragraph:

The term ``confidential business information'' includes ``proprietary information''
within the meaning of section 777(b) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C.
1677f(b)).  

3. Section 201.6 is amended by adding the following paragraph (e)(3): 
(3) The justification submitted to the Commission in connection with an
appeal shall be limited to that presented to the Secretary with the original
or amended request. When the Secretary or Acting Secretary has denied a
request on the ground that the submitter failed to provide adequate justification,
any such additional justification shall be submitted to the Secretary for
his consideration as part of an amended request. For purposes of paragraph
(1) of this subsection, the twenty (20) day period for filing an appeal
shall be tolled on filing of an amended request and a new twenty (20) day
period shall begin once the Secretary or Acting Secretary has denied the
amended request, or the approval or denial has not been forthcoming within
ten (10) days of the filing of the amended request. A denial of a request
by the Secretary on the ground of inadequate justification shall not obligate
a requester to furnish additional justification and shall not preclude
a requester from filing an appeal with the Commission based on the justification
earlier submitted to the Secretary.

<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2>

<ITAG tagnum=84>Background</ITAG>

On August 8, 1988, proposed rules relating to cash or deferred arrangements
and nondiscrimination rules for employee contributions and matching contributions
were published in the

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>This document contains proposed amendments to the Income
Tax Regulations relating to the disclosure, under section 6103(n) of the
Internal Revenue Code, of returns and return information, in connection
with the procurement of property and services for purposes of tax administration.
These proposed amendments give to the Tax Division, Department of Justice,
the authority to make these disclosures under section 6103(n) for federal
tax administration purposes. These proposed amendments affect all disclosures
by the Tax Division, Department of Justice, made to any person(s) described
in section 6103(n). These proposed amendments apply to all disclosures
made after the effective date of this amended regulation.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>DATES: </T2>These proposed amendments to the regulations are proposed
to be effective March 6, 1989. Written comments and requests for public
hearing must be delivered or mailed by February 2, 1989.

</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>

<ITAG tagnum=84>Background</ITAG>

This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations
relating to the disclosure of returns and return information under section
6103(n) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 CFR 301.6103(n)-1).

<ITAG tagnum=84>Explanation of Provisions</ITAG>

Section 6103(n) of the Code authorizes the disclosure, pursuant to Treasury
Regulations, of returns and return information to the extent necessary
and in connection with the processing, storage, transmission, and reproduction
of returns and return information, and the programming, maintenance, repair,
testing, and procurement of equipment, for purposes of tax administration.
Section 6103(b)(4) of the Code defines ``tax administration'' to include
litigation arising under the Internal Revenue laws.

Existing &Section; 301.6103(n)-1 of the regulations authorizes disclosures
to third parties under section 6103(n) only by officers or employees of
the Treasury Department, a State tax agency, or the Social Security Administration,
for tax administration purposes. Under the current regulations, the Tax
Division, Department of Justice, cannot make disclosures to third parties.
These proposed amendments would give disclosure authority to the Tax Division,
Department of Justice, in order to allow the Tax Division to disclose tax
returns and return information for purposes of obtaining litigation support
services during the course of litigation arising under the Code. This authority
is deemed necessary to enable the Tax Division to procure services from
outside contractors in connection with Tax Division's tax litigation responsibilities.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Special Analyses</ITAG>

The proposed rules are not major rules as defined in Executive Order 12291.
Therefore, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. Although this
document is a notice of proposed rulemaking that solicits public comments,
the notice and public procedure requirements of 5 U.S.C. &Section; 553
do not apply because the regulations proposed herein are interpretative.
Therefore, an initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required by
the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6).

<ITAG tagnum=84>Comments and Request for a Public Hearing</ITAG>

Before adopting the proposed amendments to the regulations, consideration
will be given to any written comments that are submitted (preferably a
signed original and eight copies) to the Internal Revenue Service. All
comments will be available for public inspection and copying in their entirety.
A public hearing may be scheduled and held upon written request by any
person who submits written comments. If a public hearing is scheduled,
notice of the time and place will be published in the 
<T4>Federal Register</T4>.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Drafting Information</ITAG>

The principal author of these proposed amendments to the regulations is
James N. Beyer of the Disclosure Litigation Division of the Office of Chief
Counsel. Internal Revenue Service. However, personnel from other offices
of the Internal Revenue Service, the Office of Chief Counsel, and the Treasury
Department participated in developing these proposed amendments to the
regulation, both on matters of substance and style.

<T2>ACTION: </T2>Notice of proposed rulemaking.
 </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>Treasury proposes to (1) amend its regulations on paying
fees to financial institutions for maintaining Treasury Tax and Loan (TT&amp;L)
accounts and processing Federal Tax deposit (FTD) payments by removing
specific references to the FTD fee structure from 31 CFR Parts 203 and
214 and transferring the fee schedule to the Treasury Financial Manual
and (2) revise its procedures to reduce the fees paid to depositaries for
processing FTD payments. Payment of fees for processing FTD payments is
not required by statute. Therefore, Treasury plans to transfer these administrative
procedures to the Treasury Financial Manual which may be obtained from
any Federal Reserve Bank. In addition, Treasury plans to reduce the current
per-item fee structure beginning in March 1989 for (1) all note option
B and C depositaries and (2) any remittance option depositary that processes
FTD dollar deposit volumes in excess of $10 million annually. However,
fee reductions for depositaries that process the smaller FTD dollar deposit
volumes and those depositaries that participate in the Federal Government's
Minority Bank Deposit Program (MBDP) will not be implemented. This rule
shall be effective upon publication as a final rule in the 
<T4>Federal Register. </T4>
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>DATE: </T2>Comments on this proposed rule must be received by February
2, 1989.

<T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Michael Salapka (202) 287-0590.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> Treasury currently pays a fee of fifty
($.50) cents to each participating depositary for each FTD coupon processed.
As proposed, to achieve budget reductions in Fiscal Year 1989, Treasury
plans to reduce fees to thirty ($.30) cents beginning in March 1989 for
(1) note option B and C depositaries and (2) any remittance option depositary
that processes more than $10 million in FTD deposits annually. 
<T3>See</T3> S. Rep. No. 387, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 16 (1988). However,
fee reductions for depositaries that process the smaller FTD dollar deposit
volumes, as well as for those depositaries that participate in the Federal
Government's Minority Bank Deposit Program, are under review. It will be
decided at a later date when such fee reductions will be implemented. The
new and any subsequent fee schedules will be published in the Treasury
Financial Manual which may be obtained from any Federal Reserve Bank.

Nearly 3,400 financial institutions participate as note option depositaries
while over 11,600 financial institutions participate under the remittance
option. Note option B and C depositaries and those remittance option depositaries
that process the largest FTD dollar deposit volumes generally benefit most
from overnight use of funds. In Fiscal Year 1988, the note option depositaries
processed $498.6 billion in FTD payments which comprised 70% of the total
FTD dollar deposit volume received by TT&amp;L depositaries. The remittance
option depositaries processed $211.2 billion in FTD payments in FY 1988
which was 30% of the total FTD dollar deposit volume received by TT&amp;L
depositaries. Note option B and C depositaries and the large remittance
option depositaries would lose proportionately less income from loss of
fees relative to the smaller remittance option depositaries. Therefore,
Treasury has determined that the initial fee reduction will be limited
to (1) note option B and C depositaries and (2) remittance option depositaries
that process over $10 million in FTD deposits annually. Fee reductions
to depositaries that participate in the Minority Bank Deposit Program,
as well as to those depositaries that process the smaller FTD dollar deposit
volumes, are under review. It will be decided at a later date when such
fee reductions to these depositaries will be implemented.

Distribution of the revised Treasury Financial Manual to the Federal Reserve
banks and TT&amp;L depositaries will be coordinated with the regulation
revisions.

Treasury has determined that this is not a major rule as defined by Executive
Order 12291. Accordingly, a regulatory impact analysis is not required.
It is hereby certified pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act that
this revision will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial
number of small entities. Accordingly, a Regulatory Flexibility Act analysis
is not required.

<T2>ACTION: </T2>Proposed rulemaking.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>USEPA is proposing to approve a site-specific State Implementation
Plan (SIP) revision to the ozone portion of the Ohio SIP. This SIP revision
was submitted as an alternative emission control plan (bubble) with monthly
averaging, for its two air cleaner spray booths and a dip tank at the Ford
Motor Company (Ford Motor) in Sandusky, Ohio. This facility is located
in Erie County, Ohio. USEPA's action is based upon the March 13, 1986,
revision request that was submitted by the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency (OEPA).

USEPA has determined that this SIP revision does not meet its policies
on bubbles and long-term averaging. However, USEPA is proposing to approve
this revision as a relaxation from reasonably available control technology
(RACT) because Ford Motor is located in an attainment area for ozone, and
approval of this revision will not cause an increase in actual emissions.
However, because this revision does not satisfy USEPA's emissions trading
policy and monthly averaging policy, and it would allow less than RACT
to be required, approval of this revision would eliminate the accommodative
Ozone SIP for Erie County, including the 1 year preconstruction monitoring
waiver for new sources.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>DATE: </T2>Comments on this revision and on the proposed USEPA action
must be received by February 2, 1989.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Copies of the SIP revision are available at the following
addresses for review: (It is recommended that you telephone Uylaine E.

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On March 13, 1986, the OEPA submitted
a site-specific revision to its ozone SIP for Ford Motor. This revision
was submitted as a bubble with monthly averaging for two air cleaner spray
booths and a Cincinnati type dip tank located at the Ford Motor Plant in
Sandusky Erie County, Ohio. Erie County, Ohio was redesignated to attainment
on June 12, 1984.

Under the existing federally approved SIP, each spray booth and dip tank
is subject to the control requirements contained in Ohio Administrative
Code (OAC) Rule 3745-21-09(U) for surface coating of miscellaneous metal
parts and products, and to the compliance schedule contained in OAC Rule
3745-21-04(C)(28). These rules require the sources to meet a volatile organic
compound (VOC) limit of 3.5 pounds of VOC per gallon of coating, excluding
water, by December 31, 1982. USEPA approved these rules as meeting the
RACT requirements of the Clean Air Act on October 31, 1980 (45 FR 72122),
and June 29, 1982 (47 FR 28097).
Bubble Policy

On April 7, 1982 (47 FR 15076), the USEPA issued a proposed Emissions Trading
Policy Statement (bubble policy) which sets forth general principles for
the creation, banking and use of emission reduction credits. This statement
indicated that it is the policy of USEPA to encourage use of emissions
trades to achieve more flexible, rapid and efficient attainment of national
ambient air quality standards (NAAQS). It describes emissions trading,
sets out general principles that USEPA will use to evaluate emissions trades
under the Clean Air Act, and expands opportunities for States and industry
to use these less costly control approaches. The April 7, 1982, notice
noted that until USEPA took final action on its policy statement, State
actions involving emission trades would be evaluated under the provisions
set forth in the proposed statement.

On December 4, 1986 (51 FR 43814), USEPA issued its final bubble policy,
which contains the criteria by which emission trades will be evaluated.
Under USEPA's final bubble policy, a baseline for determining creditable
reductions must be established both on an annual basis and for all other
averaging periods consistent with relevant NAAQS and Prevention of Significant
Deterioration (PSD) \1\
<NOTE></NOTE> increments.

<ITAG tagnum=28></ITAG>
<NOTE></NOTE>\1\ The PSD requirements are contained in Section 160-169
or Part C of the Clean Air Act. USEPA's regulations for implementing these
requirements are found in 40 CFR 51.24 and 52.21. The PSD program addresses
the emission limits and control technique technologies which are required
for the construction of certain new sources or major modifications of existing
sources in attainment areas.

This approach is necessary to protect the ambient standards and PSD increments
on a short-term as well as an annual basis. For VOC sources, the baseline
should be established on a daily basis.
Summary of Bubble

VOC emission credits obtained from the shutdown of two miscellaneous metals
spray booths and material changes are used to provide credit for use of
noncomplying coatings on two air cleaner spray booths and a dip tank. The
bubble balances SIP-allowable emissions for all five lines on an annual
basis. The revision also allows monthly averaging to determine compliance
with a daily cap.

The actual and allowable emissions and the change in emissions from before
to after the bubble are summarized in the following table:

The ``before bubble'' emissions are based on actual 1982 production levels.
The ``after bubble'' actual emissions are expected 1987 emissions and do
not represent a regulatory limit. The actual emissions will not increase
above 84.7 tons per year because this is the limit contained in the variance.

<ITAG tagnum=84>USEPA's Analysis of The Bubble</ITAG>

The annual limit of 84.7 tons of VOC proposed by Ford meets the requirements
of USEPA's bubble policy, which specifies that for trades in attainment
areas the baseline must generally be determined using the lower of actual
or allowable emissions, as of the time the source submitted its bubble
application to the State. Since Ford submitted this bubble to the OEPA
on September 13, 1982, and was using no complying coatings at that time,
the use of 1982 allowable emissions is acceptable.

The revision does not, however, contain a meaniful rate-based (e.g., lb.
VOC/ gal. coating) daily limit. Such a limit should be based on the allowable
emissions as discussed above. The daily limit proposed by Ford appears
to be based on actual maximum daily emissions. Because none of the sources
were in compliance at the time the bubble was submitted to the State, the
allowable emissions are lower than the actual emissions, and should be
used as the baseline. In addition, the variance allows compliance with
the daily cap to be determined as a monthly average.

Because, the OEPA has not provided an acceptable bubble related rate-based
daily limit this revision is not approvable as a bubble under the final
ETPS. Despite this deficiency, USEPA is proposing to approve the revision
as a relaxation from RACT because the source is located in an ozone attainment
area. This basis is discussed further later in this notice.
Criteria for Monthly Averaging

USEPA's January 20, 1984, policy memorandum entitled ``Averaging Times
for Compliance With VOC Emission Limits'' contains the criteria for evaluating
a VOC request for extended averaging which are as follows:
Criterion 1

Extended averaging can be permitted where the source operations are such
that daily VOC emissions cannot be determined, or where the application
of RACT for each emission point is not economically or technically feasible
on a daily basis.
Criterion 2

The area must not lack an approved SIP and there must not be any measured
violations.
Criterion 3

A demonstration must be made that the use of monthly averaging (greater
than 24-hour averaging) will not jeopardize either ambient standards attainment
or the reasonable further progress (RFP) plan for the area. This must be
accomplished by showing that the maximum daily increase in emissions associated
with monthly averaging is consistent with the approved ozone SIP for the
area.
Criterion 4

Averaging times must be as short as practicable and in no case longer than
30 days.

The OEPA believes that neither add-on control nor conversion to waterborne
or high solids coatings is economically feasible due to the small amount
of metal parts that will be painted after the presumed conversion to plastic
parts is completed. However, the OEPA has not provided any documentation
to support Ford Motor's cost estimates. Therefore, USEPA cannot evaluate
the State's determination that add-on controls and low VOC coatings for
this facility are not economically feasible. Nevertheless, USEPA is proposing
approval of this SIP revision with monthly averaging based on the fundamental
criterion that the Clean Air Act does not require the implementation of
RACT in this area. This revision could not be approved if the source were
located in a nonattainment area. Ford Motor is located in Erie County which
has been designated as an attainment area for the pollutant ozone. Approval
of this proposed SIP revision will not cause any increase in the historical
VOC emission level from this source. Under USEPA's existing policy, however,
no demonstration of attainment and maintenance was required in the SIP
for this area.

This rulemaking relaxes a stationary source RACT emission limitation in
an area that always should have been designated as attainment/unclassifiable
for ozone. Erie County was originally designated as nonattainment for the
ozone NAAQS. This was based on the assumption that nonattainment of the
0.08 parts per million (ppm) ozone Standard (the level of the standard
prior to 1979) was widespread around nearby major urban areas. As requested
by OEPA, USEPA designated Erie County as nonattainment although no in-county
monitoring data were available. After the ozone standard was changed to
0.12 ppm, OEPA recognized that the assumption of widespread ozone nonattainment
was no longer valid and initiated the redesignation of Erie County to attainment
of the ozone standard. USEPA approved this redesignation on June 12, 1984
(49 FR 24124). RACT was imposed in this area, by the State, not to satisfy
an ozone nonattainment SIP planning requirement, but rather to allow the
State to have an accommodative SIP. The original principal of this accommodative
ozone SIP for areas classified as attainment/unclassifiable was to require
RACT-level controls on existing sources in lieu of requiring new major
sources of VOC to do preconstruction monitoring. This monitoring would
normally be required of new major sources in attainment/unclassifiable
areas under USEPA's prevention of significant deterioration regulations.
The rationale behind this tradeoff is that the ``extra'' emission reductions
obtained from these additional RACT controls would be able to accommodate
new source growth in these attainment/unclassifiable areas. Therefore,
this action, when promulgated, will cancel the accommodative SIP for Erie
County. This means that all new major VOC sources and major modifications
in this county must comply with all the PSD monitoring requirements. Because
this portion of the State's accommodative SIP never had any effect relative
to any designated ozone nonattainment area SIP, the RACT relaxation in
this notice will also have no effect on nonattainment areas_all sources
wishing to locate in nonattainment areas must comply with the State's federally
approved Part D new source review program.

If the State wishes to correct the inconsistencies cited above in order
to retain the accommodative SIP for the area, it should also review the
following guidance for other potential inconsistencies: (1) Appendix D
of the proposed Post-1987 ozone policy titled ``Discrepancies and Inconsistencies
Found in Current SIPs,'' (2) a May 25, 1988, clarification of Appendix
D titled ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and
Deviations,'' and (3) the ``SIP Approvability Checklist-Enforceability,''
which is attached to a September 23, 1987, policy memorandum titled ``Review
of State Implementation Plan Revisions for Enforceability and Legal Sufficiency.''
These documents contain USEPA requirements (largely dealing with SIP approvability
and enforceability) which must be met for a site-specific SIP revision
to be approved in an attainment area without eliminating the accommodative
SIP for the area.

USEPA is providing a 30-day comment period on this notice of proposed rule-making.
Public comments received on or before February 2, 1989 will be considered
in USEPA's final rulemaking. All comments will be available for inspection
during normal business hours at the Region V office listed at the front
of this notice.

Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator has certified that SIP approvals
do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. (See 46 FR 8709).

The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements
of section 3 of Executive Order 12291.

<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>EPA today proposes to designate an existing dredged material
disposal site located off the Louisiana coast at the mouth of the Mississippi
River for the continued disposal of dredged material removed from the Southwest
Pass Channel. This proposed site designation is for an indefinite period

<ITAG tagnum=84>A. Background</ITAG>

Section 102(c) of the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act
of 1972, as amended, 33 U.S.C. 1401 
<T3>et seq.</T3> (``the Act''), gives the Administrator of EPA the authority
to designate sites where ocean dumping may be permitted. On December 23,
1986, the Administrator delegated the authority to designate ocean dumping
sites to the Regional Administrator of the Region in which the site is
located. This proposed site designation is being made pursuant to that
authority.

The EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations (40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter H, Section
228.4) state the ocean dumping sites will be designated by publication
in Part 228. A list of ``Approved Interim and Final Ocean Dumping Sites''
was published on January 11, 1977 (42 FR 2461 
<T3>et seq.</T3>). That list established the Southwest Pass-Mississippi
River site for the disposal of material dredged from the Southwest Pass
Channel. In January 1980, the interim status of the Southwest Pass site
was extended indefinitely. Interested persons may participate in this proposed
rulemaking by submitting written comments within 45 days of the date of
this publication to the EPA Region VI address given above.

<ITAG tagnum=84>B. EIS Development</ITAG>

Section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42
U.S.C. 4321 
<T3>et seq.,</T3> (``NEPA'') requires that Federal agencies prepare an
Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on proposals for major Federal actions
significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. While NEPA
does not apply to EPA activities of this type, EPA has voluntarily committed
to prepare EISs in connection with ocean dumping site designations such
as this (39 FR 16186, May 7, 1974).

In August 1984 EPA distributed a Draft Environmental Impact Statement entitled
``Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the Southwest Pass-Mississippi
River Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site Designation'' to the public
for a 45-day review and comment period. Eight comment letters were received
on the Draft EIS. The Agency has responded to the comments in the Final
EIS. Editorial or factual corrections required by the comments have been
incorporated in the text and noted in the Agency's response. Comments which
could not be appropriately treated changes have been addressed point by
point in the Final EIS. On December 9, 1988, a notice of availability of
the Final EIS for public review and comment was published in the 
<T4>Federal Register</T4>. The public comment period on the Final EIS will
close on January 9, 1989. The EIS is available for review at the EPA address
given above. 

The proposed action discussed in the EIS is designation for continuing
use of an ocean disposal site for dredged material. The purpose of the
designation is to provide an environmentally acceptable location for ocean
disposal. The appropriateness of ocean disposal is determined on a case-by-case
basis. Prior to each use the Corps will comply with 40 CFR Part 227 by
providing EPA a letter containing all the necessary information.

The EIS discusses the need for the action and examines ocean disposal sites
and alternatives to the proposed action. Land-based disposal alternatives
were examined in a previously published EIS and the analysis was updated
in EPA's Final EIS based on information from the COE.

About 1200 acres of marshes have been built on the west side of the Southwest
Pass Channel using dredged material. However, use of the dredged material
disposed at the Southwest Pass site for marsh creation purposes is not
feasible because of technical and cost considerations. Long pipelines would
be required to transport the material and the COE has determined that pipeline
dredges in this area were impractical and unsafe because of the length
of pipe and cable required, concerns over pipe breakage in rough seas and
difficulties with currents in the area. Consideration was also given to
the use of these materials for beach nourishment. The same difficulties
associated with transport of the materials by pipeline for marsh creation
would apply. Also the materials consist primarily of fines, which are generally
considered unsuitable for beach nourishment. Upland disposal was also evaluated
but there are no upland disposal sites located in the vicinity of the Gulf
portion of Southwest Pass.

Four ocean disposal alternatives_two shallow water areas (including the
proposed site), a mid-shelf area and a deepwater area_were evaluated. Use
of the mid-shelf and deepwater sites would involve: (1) Increased transportation
costs without any corresponding environmental benefits; (2) increased surveillance
and monitoring costs due to the greater depths of water and distance from
shore; and (3) increased safety hazards resulting from transporting dredged
material greater distances through areas of active oil and gas development.
Because of these reasons, the mid-shelf area and the deepwater area were
eliminated from further consideration. An alternate shallow-water site
located northeast or northwest of the existing site was also evaluated.
However, no environmental benefits would be gained by its selection. Rather,
the alternate site would be located in more biologically productive waters
nearer to estuarine areas.

In accordance with the requirements of the Endangered Species Act, EPA
has completed a biological assessment and is currently coordinating a no
adverse effect determination with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
EPA is also coordinating with the State of Louisiana under requirements
of the Coastal Zone Management Act.

<ITAG tagnum=84>C. Proposed Site Designation</ITAG>

The existing disposal site is located on the west side of the Southwest
Pass Channel approximately 1.75 nautical miles from shore. Water depths
within the site range from 2.7 to 32.3 meters. The boundary coordinates
are as follows: 28&degrees;54&min16;12&min16;&min16; N, 89&degrees;27&min16;15&min16;&min16;
W; 28&degrees;54&min16;12&min16;&min16; N, 89&degrees;26&min16;00&min16;&min16;
W; 28&degrees;51&min16;00&min16;&min16; N, 89&degrees;27&min16;15&min16;&min16;
W; 28&degrees;51&min16;00&min16;&min16; N, 89&degrees;26&min16;00&min16;&min16;
W.

<ITAG tagnum=84>D. Regulatory Requirements</ITAG>

Five general criteria are used in the selection and approval of ocean disposal
sites for continuing use. Sites are selected so as to minimize interference
with other marine activities, to keep any temporary perturbations from
the dumping from causing impacts outside the disposal site, and to permit
effective monitoring to detect any adverse impacts at an early stage. Where
feasible, locations off the Continental Shelf are chosen. If at any time
disposal operations at a site cause unacceptable adverse impacts, further
use of the site may be terminated or limitations placed on the use of the
site to reduce the impacts to acceptable levels. The general criteria are
given in &Section;228.5 of the EPA Ocean Dumping Regulations; Section 228.6
lists eleven specific factors used in evaluating a proposed disposal site
to assure that the general criteria are met.

EPA has determined, based on information presented in the Draft and Final
EISs, that the existing site is acceptable under the five general criteria.
The Continental Shelf location is not feasible and no environmental benefit
would be obtained by selecting such a site. Historical use of the existing
site has not resulted in substantial adverse effects to living resources
of the ocean or to other uses of the marine environment. The characteristics
of the proposed site are reviewed below in terms of the eleven specific
factors.

1. 
<T3>Geographical position, depth of water, bottom topography and distance
from coast. </T3>(40 CFR 228.6(a)(1).)

Geographical position, average water depth, and distance from the coast
for the disposal site are given above. Bottom topography is irregular.

2. 
<T3>Location in relation to breeding, spawning, nursery, feeding, or passage
areas of living resources in adult or juvenile phases. (40 CFR 228.6(a)(2).)</T3>

The northwestern Gulf of Mexico is a breeding, spawning, nursery and feeding
area for shrimp, menhaden and bottom fish. The Mississippi Delta in the
vicinity of Southwest Pass is a highly productive area with a wide variety
of plankton and nekton. Due to runoff from the Mississippi River, the Delta
area near the mouth of Southwest Pass experiences changing salinity, temperature,
turbidity and nutrient conditions over an annual cycle. During periods
of active dredged material disposal, there would be short-term interferences
with breeding, spawning, feeding and passage of the nekton. However, it
would be difficult to differentiate this interference from that resulting
from high flows of the Mississippi River. The existing disposal site is
seaward of any estuaries or bays.

3. 
<T3>Location in relation to beaches and other amenity areas. </T3>(40 CFR
228.6(a)(3).)

There are no beaches in the vicinity of the existing disposal site. The
area around Southwest Pass is not readily accessible by land. Recreation
in the area is limited to boating related activities, primarily sport fishing.

4. 
<T3>Types and quantities of wastes proposed to be disposed of, and proposed
methods of release, including methods of packing the wastes, if any. </T3>(40
CFR 228.6(a)(4).)

Dredged material released at approved dredged material disposal sites must
conform to the EPA criteria in the Ocean Dumping Regulations (40 CFR Part
227). The dredged material to be disposed of consists of about 4 percent
sand and 96 percent fines. Historically, an average of 14.5 million cubic
yards (mcy) of material is dredged annually, with a range of 1.8 to 32.5
mcy. Similar quantities will continue to be dredged and disposed of annually
using either agitation dredging in high river flows or hopper dredges for
transport during low flows. The dredged material will not be packaged in
any way.   

5. 
<T3>Feasibility of surveillance and monitoring. </T3>(40 CFR 228.6(a)(5).)
 

Surveillance and monitoring are both feasible at this site. Surveillance
can be accomplished by inspection of logs, observation by ship riders or
from aircraft and observation from the light station at the end of Southwest
Pass. The shallow depth of the site and its close proximity to the shore
facilitate monitoring at the site. Based on historic data, an intense monitoring
program is not warranted. However, in order to provide adequate warning
of environmental harm, EPA will develop a monitoring plan in coordination
with the COE. The plan would concentrate on periodic depth soundings and
sediment and water quality testing.  

6. 
<T3>Dispersal, horizontal transport and vertical mixing characteristics
of the area, including prevailing current direction and velocity, if any.
</T3>(40 CFR 228.6(a)(6).)  

The Mississippi River plume passes through the site in a westerly or southwesterly
direction and may mask the turbidity plume from dredged material disposal.
Prevailing currents at the site are southwest at speeds of 0 to 4 knots.
Disposed dredged material fines become mixed with the Mississippi River
plume and move generally southwest. Net movement of the heavier dredged
materials which settle is to the west. Freshwater discharge from the Mississippi
River results in stratification at the mouth of Southwest Pass; seaward
of the Pass vertical mixing increases.  

7. 
<T3>Existence and effects of current and previous discharges and dumping
in the area (including cumulative effects). </T3>(40 CFR 228.6(a)(7).)
 

The materials dredged from the Southwest Pass Channel are similar to the
materials in the Mississippi River flow. And therefore, the sediments at
the disposal site are similar to the sediments in the broad area off the
mouth of Southwest Pass. Previous site surveys have not detected any effects
of disposal at the existing site.  

8. 
<T3>Interference with shipping, fishing, recreation, mineral extraction,
desalination, fish and shellfish culture, areas of special scientific importance
and other legitimate uses of the ocean. </T3>(40 CFR 228.6(a)(8).) Some
interference with shipping, recreational and commercial fishing and boating
are expected during dredged material disposal operations. Although there
is no fish or shellfish culture within the site, there will be some impacts
on naturally occurring fish and shellfish within the site. The only mineral
extraction within the site is oil and gas; past experience has indicated
no interference during dredged material disposal.  

9. 
<T3>The existing water quality and ecology of the site as determined by
available data or by trend assessment or baseline surveys. </T3>(40 CFR
228.6(a)(9).)  

The water quality and ecology at the existing site is generally similar
to the nearshore region off the Louisiana coast affected by discharges
from the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River. The water quality varies
depending on the amount and mixing of fresh water runoff occurring at the
time. Data gathered during the 1980 and 1981 surveys indicated that trace
metal concentrations and chlorinated hydrocarbon concentrations were comparable
to historic data for the area.  

10. 
<T3>Potentiality for the development or recruitment of nuisance species
in the disposal site. </T3>(40 CFR 228.6(a)(10).)  

Past disposal of dredged material at the existing site has not resulted
in the development or recruitment of nuisance species. Considering the
similarity of the dredged material with the existing sediments, it is not
expected that continued disposal of dredged material will result in the
development of such species.  

11. 
<T3>Existence at or in close proximity to the site of any significant natural
or cultural features of historical importance. </T3>(40 CFR 228.6(a)(11).)
 

There are no known features of historical or cultural significance that
occur within the site. There are some shipwrecks located about 3.5 miles
from the site. 

<ITAG tagnum=84>E. Proposed Action</ITAG>

Based on the Draft and Final EISs, EPA proposes to designate the Southwest
Pass_Mississippi River ocean dredged material disposal site. The existing
site is compatible with the general criteria and specific factors used
for site evaluation. While the Corps does not administratively issue itself
a permit, the requirements that must be met before dredged material derived
from Federal projects can be discharged into ocean waters are the same
as where a permit would be required. EPA has the authority to approve or
to disapprove or to propose conditions upon dredged material permits for
ocean dumping.

<ITAG tagnum=84>F. Regulatory Assessments</ITAG>

Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is required to perform a Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis for all rules which may have a significant impact
on a substantial number of small entites. EPA has determined that this
action will not have a significant impact on small entities since the site
designation will only have the effect of providing a disposal option for
dredged material. Consequently, this rule does not necessitate preparation
of a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.

Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a regulation is ``major''
and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.
This action will not result in an annual effect on the economy of $100
million or more or cause any of the other effects which would result in
its being classified by the Executive Order as a ``major'' rule. Consequently,
this rule does not necessitate preparation of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.

This Proposed Rule does not contain any information collection requirements
subject to the Office of Management and Budget review under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 
<T3>et seq.</T3>

<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>Part 1610 is proposed to be amended to conform the rule
to the changes made by the 1977 amendments to the Legal Services Corporation
Act of 1974. The application of the words ``any purpose prohibited'' in
section 1010(c) of the Act is proposed to be amended to include all prohibitions
of the LSC Act, whether characterized as procedural or conditional. In
addition, a provision is added establishing a presumption that all recipient
funds are LSC or private funds received for the provision of legal assistance,
unless shown by the recipient to be otherwise by clear and convincing evidence.
These changes collectively will redirect private funds toward the purposes
intended by the LSC Act.

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Part 1610, concerning the use of non-LSC
funds by LSC recipients, implements section 1010(c) of the LSC Act, which
restricts the use of private funds received for the provision of legal
assistance to purposes not prohibited by the Act, and restricts the use
of public funds to the purposes for which they were received. The regulation
was originally promulgated in 1976 and has not been revised since. 
<T3>See </T3>41 FR 25901, June 23, 1976.
Section 1610.1

Section 1610.1, which identifies specific prohibitions found in the LSC
Act pertaining to LSC and private funds, does not reflect the renumbering
of portions of the Act or the deletion of a prohibition in the Act made
in 1977 when the Act was amended. The 1977 amendments to the Act removed
the prohibition on representation of juveniles and renumbered several other
provisions listed in &Section; 1610.1. 91 Stat. 1621 (1977). The proposed
changes would make the references to the LSC Act in &Section; 1610.1 conform
with the 1977 amendments.

Nowhere in the Act is the phrase ``any purpose prohibited by this title''
defined or explained, nor do the committee reports lend specificity to
the provision. When explaining the conference language to the Senate for
final approval, however, Senator Cranston stated that ``private foundation
funds may not be used by a recipient for legal assistance activities that
we do not permit that same recipient to engage in with Corporation funds.''
120 CONG. REC. S12935 (daily ed. July 19, 1974). Thus, wherever in the
Act the use of LSC funds is prohibited for certain legal assistance activities,
the use of private funds likewise is prohibited.

When promulgating Part 1610 in 1976, the Corporation applied section 1010(c)
to prohibitions on types of legal assistance activities, as opposed to
affirmative requirements or procedural limitations. Pursuant to this determination,
the Corporation classified those activities covered by this construction
of section 1010(c) in &Section; 1610.1 of Part 1610. As there is nothing
in the Act limiting application of section 1010(c) to specific types of
legal assistance activities, the decision as to which provisions in the
Act should be included in &Section; 1610.1 as prohibited purposes properly
may be influenced by discretionary policy considerations consistent with
the purposes of the Act.

Upon review of these issues, it is now proposed to define ``any purpose
prohibited by this title'' to include four additional categories of activities
in &Section; 1610.1. Given the scarcity of funds available for the direct
provision of legal assistance to the poor, the use of private funds appropriately
should be limited for these four categories in the same manner as LSC funds.

LSC proposes to revise Part 1610 to require recipients to follow the same
procedural requirements for the use of private funds for class action cases
as the LSC Act presently requires for LSC funds. Requiring project directors
to consider the resources necessary for a class action undertaken with
private funds will provide a measure of assurance that the competing interests
of individual clients who could benefit from the program's services are
appropriately weighed. While section 1006(d)(5) does not prohibit all class
action suits, it does prohibit any class action not expressly approved
by the project director in accordance with board policies. If LSC funds
cannot be used for unapproved class actions, then under section 1010(c)
regulation of the use of private funds in the same manner serves the purposes
of the Act.

While attempting to allow class actions when appropriate and necessary,
Congress wanted such cases initiated only after being given careful consideration
by the top program managers. Ordinarily, a class action will consume a
disporportionate share of a program's staff time and resources. LSC recipients
should not, without careful consideration, invest large portions of their
resources, whether private or LSC funds, in class actions, because this
precludes the use of those resources for needed individual service. The
same intent is reinforced by the inclusion of even stricter procedural
requirements in LSC's annual appropriations act. 
<T3>See, e.g., </T3>Pub. L. No. 99-180, 99 Stat. 1162 (1985); Pub. L. No.
100-102 Stat. 2223 (1988). 

LSC also proposes to prohibit the use of private funds to provide assistance
to ineligible clients. The centerpiece of the Act is that LSC funds may
not be used to represent ineligible clients, that is, those who are not
poor by LSC standards. Indeed, the central purpose of the Act is ``to provide
high quality legal assistance to those who would be otherwide unable to
afford adequate legal counsel.'' 42 U.S.C. 2996, section 1001(2). Once
it is determined that a client is ineligible, LSC funds may not be used
for legal representation. Pursuant to section 1010(c), if LSC funds may
not be used to provide legal assistance to ineligible clients, private
funds may be likewise restricted. Because the need for legal assistance
to eligible clients is still often unmet, directing private funds_as well
as LSC funds_to eligible clients will serve the Act's central mandate of
providing equal access to justice for the nation's poor. 

The Corporation porposes to include as a prohibited purpose the provision
in seciton 1006(a)(3), 42 U.S.C. 2996e(a)(3), which prohibits the Corporation
from making grants or contracts for broad general legal or policy research
(``general research'') unrelated to representation of eligible clients.
For the purposes of section 1010(c), which applies to private funds provided
for legal assistance activities, general research is legal assistance when
done on behalf of a client. If section 1006(a)(3) prohibited general research
unrelated to representation of any client, then such research might arguably
be interpreted as research that is not legal assistance. Although general
research done on behalf of an 
<T3>eligible </T3>client is allowable, section 1006(a)(3) prohibits general
research when done on behalf of an 
<T3>ineligible </T3>client. Since the Act prohibits the use of LSC funds
for general research for ineligible clients, section 1010(c) provides authority
for the Corporation to prohibit the use of private funds for such research.
Again, the Corporation believes it to be sound policy for LSC recipients
to direct all available funds for the provision of legal assistance to
eligible clients. 

Finally, LSC proposes to include as a prohibited purpose the prohibition
in section 1007(b)(5), 42 U.S.C. 2996f(b)(5), which provides that LSC funds
must not be used ``to make grants to or enter into contracts with any private
law firm which expends 50 percent or more of its resources and time litigating
issues in the broad interests of a majority of the public,'' 
<T3>i.e., </T3>a public interest law firm. Since LSC funds may not be used
by recipients to make grants to or enter into contracts with public interest
law firms, section 1010(c) requires that recipients may not use their private
funds for such grants or contracts. The type of law firm that may not be
funded with LSC or private funds is one that receives a majority of its
revenue from retainers or fees of private clients, and spends a majority
of its time and resources on social or legal reform litigation. 
Section 1610.4 

A new paragraph (b) is proposed for addition to &Section;1610.4 to establish
a presumption that, absent a clear and convincing demonstration to the
contrary by the recipient, all recipient funds are LSC or private funds
received for the provision of legal assistance. Not only would recipients
have to prove when funds were public, they would also have to prove that
the funds are received for a purpose other than the provision of legal
assistance. 

It is appropriate to place the burden of proving that funds are public
funds on the recipient, because the recipient possesses pertinent documents
and information, such as applications for grants, award letters, correspondence
with the funding entity, and grantor audits and monitoring reports, to
which the corporation may not have ready access. As part of its planning
and budgeting process, a recipient must match funds it receives with activities
that are consistent with the funding and, therefore, the recipient will
have a basic for its determination that readily can be documented. Also,
as the Corporation's 1981 and 1986 editions of the 
<T3>Audit and Accounting Guide for Recipients and Auditors </T3>require
that contributions with restrictions be recorded in a restricted fund,
a recipient's independent auditors will likely have made an independent
determination of the nature of all the recipient's funds, which will be
able to substantiate the recipient's assertion. Finally, because &Section;1630.3
allocates to the recipient the burden of proof in defending a questioned
cost to show that funds used are not subject to a restriction, a recipient
should be able to determine the existence of any restrictions before allocating
expenses.

The proposal also establishes a presumption that all private funds received
by a recipient are received for the provision of legal assistance, absent
a clear and convincing showing that the funds were received for other than
legal assistance activities. Basic field and support recipients deliver
services using lawyers and paralegal staff, and so all services provided
by a recipient should be for the purpose of legal assistance. Therefore,
unless a private funding source specifically restricts the use of its funds
to some non-legal purpose, all LSC and private funds would be considered
received for legal assistance. 

Finally, the authority section is proposed to be amended to add section
1008(e) of the LSC Act, which provides authority for the Corporation to
promulgate regulations.

<T2>SUMMARY:</T2> The Legal Services Corporation proposes to amend Part
1611 by revising &Section; 1611.3(e), so that no person whose income exceeds
the maximum annual income level established by a recipient would be eligible

<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2>  

Section 1010(c) of the LSC Act restricts the use of private funds received
for the provision of legal assistance to purposes not prohibited by the
Act, 42 U.S.C. section 2996i. In 1976, LSC promulgated 45 CFR Part 1610
to implement section 1010(c). Section 1610.1 listed those activities which
the Corporation decided to include as ``any purpose prohibited'' within
the meaning of section 1010(c). No prohibition against providing legal
assistance to ineligible clients with private funds was included. Similarly,
when LSC first promulgated Part 1611 in 1976, it included a provision,
&Section; 1611.3(e), allowing the use of non-LSC funds for ineligible clients.
 

Upon review, as set out in the accompanying notice of proposed revisions
to 45 CFR Part 1610, it is proposed that private funds should not be used
to represent ineligible clients, because program resources should be focused
on the client population with the most pressing needs. This proposal would
revise &Section; 1611.3(e) to prohibit the representation of ineligible
clients with private funds.

<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>On November 23, 1988, FRA published in the 
<T4>Federal Register </T4>an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM)
(53 FR 47554) on grade crossing signal system safety and scheduled a public
hearing to be held on December 14, 1988. Because all interested parties
could not be heard in one day, the public hearing was extended to two days
and rescheduled for December 19 and 20, 1988. The deadline for filing written
comments in this proceeding remained January 4, 1989.

The Association of American Railroads has requested a two week extension
of time in which to file written comments. FRA recognizes the time pressures
in commenting on the issues raised in the testimony and the extensive documentation
produced at the hearing, therefore, FRA is extending the deadline to January
17, 1989 for receipt of written comments in this proceeding.

<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Amendment 9 to the FMP was prepared
by the Council under authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and
Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1808 
<T3>et seq. </T3>(Magnuson Act) and has been submitted for review, approval,
and implementation by the Secretary. The Magnuson Act also requires that
the Secretary, upon receipt of a fishery management plan amendment, immediately
publish a notice of its availability for public review and comment. The
Secretary will consider the comments received from the public in determining
whether or not to approve the amendment.

Amendment 9 to the FMP would: (1) Replace the long-term spawning escapement
goal and rebuilding schedule for Klamath River fall chinook with fixed
annual spawning escapement and harvest rates which will allow a fixed percentage
from each year class of natural spawners to escape the fisheries and spawn,
subject to a minimum escapement floor for naturally spawning adults; (2)
modify the ocean harvest allocation of coho and chinook between non-Indian
commercial and recreational fisheries north of Cape Falcon, Oregon; (3)
revise the notice procedures for inseason management actions; (4) conform
federal and state regulations regarding the incidental harvest of steelhead
by recreational fishermen; (5) authorize inseason reporting requirements
for commercial fishermen to provide timely accounting of catches from any
regulatory area subject to quota management; and (6) increase the Council's
flexibility in setting commercial and recreational season beginning and
ending dates. 

An environmental assessment (required under the National Environmental
Policy Act) and a regulatory impact review/initial regulatory flexibility
analysis (required under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility
Act) are incorporated in the amendment.

Proposed regulations to implement this amendment are scheduled to be published

<ITAG tagnum=56>Availability of Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant
Impact Relative to Issuance of a Permit to Field Test Genetically Engineered
Disease Resistant Tomato Plants</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>

<T2>ACTION: </T2>Notice.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>By this notice, we are advising the public that an environmental
assessment and finding of no significant impact have been prepared by the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service relative to the issuance of
a permit to Calgene, Inc., to allow the field testing in the State of Hawaii
of genetically engineered tomato plants, modified to contain an extra gene
to reduce endopolygalacturonase production. The assessment provides a basis
for the conclusion that the field testing of these genetically engineered
tomato plants does not present a risk of introduction or dissemination
of a plant pest and also will not have any significant impact on the quality
of the human environment. Based upon this finding of no significant impact,
the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that an environmental
impact statement need not be prepared.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Copies of the environmental assessment and finding of
no significant impact are available for public inspection at Biotechnology,
Biologics, and Environmental Protection, Animal and Plant Health Inspection

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On June 16, 1987, the Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service (APHIS) published a final rule in the 
<T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 22892-22915), which established a new
Part 340 in Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations entitled ``Introduction
of Organisms and Products Altered or Produced Through Genetic Engineering
Which Are Plant Pests or Which There Is Reason to Believe Are Plant Pests''
(the rule). The rule regulates the introduction (importation, interstate
movement, and release into the environment) of genetically engineered organisms
and products that are plant pests or that there is reason to believe are
plant pests (regulated articles). A permit must be obtained before a regulated
article can be introduced in the United States. The rule sets forth procedures
for obtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement
of a regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into
the environment of a regulated article. APHIS has stated that it would
prepare an environmental assessment and, when necessary, an environmental
impact statement before issuing a permit for the release into the environment
of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).

Calgene, Inc., of Davis, California, has submitted an application for a
permit for release into the environment, for the field testing of genetically
engineered tomato plants modified to contain an extra gene to reduce endopolygalacturonase
production. One function that the enzyme endopoloygalacturonase performs
is to enable tomato fruits to soften during the ripening process.

In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impact
on the environment of releasing the tomato plants under the conditions
described in the Calgene, Inc., application. APHIS concluded that the field
testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination
and will not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.

The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, which
are based on data submitted by Calgene, Inc., as well as a review of other
relevant literature, provide the public with documentation of APHIS' review
and analysis of the environmental impacts associated with conducting the
field testing.

The facts supporting APHIS's finding of no significant impact are summarized
below and are contained in the environmental assessment.

1. An endopolygalacturonase gene from tomato has been modified and inserted
into a tomato chromosome in such a way as to produce anti-sense RNA, for
the purpose of reducing endopolygalacturonase production in order to delay
ripening of the tomato fruit. In nature, the genetic material contained
in a plant chromosome can only be transferred to another plant by cross-pollination
with a sexually compatible plant. In this field test, none of the introduced
genes can spread to sexually compatible plants outside the field test plot
because the field test plot is located sufficiently far from any sexually
compatible plant.

2. Neither the modified endopolygalacturonase gene nor the derived anti-sense
RNA confers on tomato any plant pest characteristics. The tomato cultivar
(UC82B) from which the endopolygalacturonase gene was obtained is not a
plant pest.

3. The anti-sense endopolygalacturonase gene does not provide the transformed
tomato plants with any measurable selective advantage over nontransformed
tomato plants in the transformed plants' ability to be disseminated or
to become established in the environment.

4. The vector used to transfer the anti-sense endopolygalacturonase gene
to tomato plants has been evaluated for its use in this experiment, and
does not pose a plant pest risk in this experiment. The vector, although
derived from a plasmid with known plant pathogenic potential, has been
disarmed; that is, genes that are necessary to confer plant pathogenic
traits have been removed from the vector. The vector has been tested and
shown to be not pathogenic to any susceptible plant.

5. The vector agent, the phytopathogenic bacterium that was used to deliver
the anti-sense endopolygalacturonase gene into a tomato plant cell, was
eliminated and is no longer associated with the transformed tomato plants.

6. Horizontal movement of genetic material after insertion into a plant
genome (i.e., chromosomal DNA) has not been demonstrated. The vector acts
by delivering and inserting the gene into the tomato genome. The vector
does not survive in or on a transformed plant. No mechanism in nature to
horizontally move an inserted gene from the chromosome of a transformed
plant to any other organism has been reported in the scientific literature.

7. The size of the field test plot is small (110 feet by 192 feet). The
plot will be located within a 10-acre cotton field on a private farm with
restricted access.

The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact have
been prepared in accordance with; (1) The National Environmental Policy
Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 
<T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality
for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508),
(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR Part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines
Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384 and 44 FR 51272-51274).

<ITAG tagnum=56>Baldy Fire Recovery, Klamath National Forest, Siskiyou County, CA;
Intention to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement</ITAG>

The Department of Agriculture, Forest Service will prepare an environmental
impact statement (EIS) for a proposal to implement fire recovery activities
on a portion of the Bald-Ten Fire on the Happy Camp Ranger District; this
EIS will encompass a portion of the Siskiyou released-roadless area.

A range of alternatives for this area will be considered. One of these
will be no recovery activities in the project area. Other alternatives
will range from implementing fire recovery activities to recovery in combination
with more extensive timber management projects.

Federal and State, and local agencies, and other individuals or organizations
who may be interested in or affected by the decision will be invited to
participate in the scoping process. This process will include:

1. Identification of potential issues.

2. Identification of issues to be analyzed in depth.

3. Elimination of insignificant issues or those which have been covered
by a previous environmental review.

4. Determination of potential cooperating agencies and assignment of responsibilities.

The Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, will be invited
to participate as a cooperating agency to evaluate potential impacts on
threatened and endangered species habitat if any such species are found
to exist in the watershed.

The Forest Supervisor will hold a public meeting at the Forest Supervisors
Office, Klamath National Forest, large conference room, 1312 Fairlane Road,
Yreka, California, at 1:00 p.m., on Saturday, February 4, 1989. This meeting
will be held in conjunction with the Dillon Creek EIS.

Robert Rice, Forest Supervisor, Klamath National Forest, is the responsible
official.

The analysis is expected to take about 10 months. The draft environmental
impact statement should be available for public review by January, 1990.
The final environmental impact statement is scheduled for completion by
April, 1990.

Written comments and suggestions concerning the analysis should be sent
to George Harper, District Ranger, Happy Camp Ranger District, Klamath
National Forest, Happy Camp, California, CA 96039, by March 1, 1989.

Questions about the proposed action and environmental impact statement
should be directed to Terry Chute, Planner, Happy Camp Ranger District,

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2>

<ITAG tagnum=84>Background</ITAG>

On April 21, 1988, the Department published in the 
<T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 13140) the preliminary results of its
administrative review of the antidumping duty order on barium chloride
from the People's Republic of China (49 FR 40635, October 17, 1984). The
Department has now completed that administrative review in accordance with
section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act'').

<ITAG tagnum=84>Scope of the Review</ITAG>

Imports covered by the review are shipments of barium chloride, a chemical
compound having the formula BaCl2 or BaCl2-2H2O. These imports are currently
classifiable under item number 417.7000 of the 
<T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>and under item
number 2827.38.00 of the 
<T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule.</T3>

The review covers China National Chemicals Import and Export Corporation
(Sinochem) and the periods April 6, 1984 through September 30, 1984 and
October 1, 1985 through September 30, 1986.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Analysis of Comments Received</ITAG>

We invited interested parties to comment on the preliminary results. We
received timely comments from Cometals, Inc., an importer, and Chemical
Products Corporation, the petitioner. At the request of Cometals, we held
a public hearing on June 9, 1988.

<T3>Comment 1: </T3>Cometals argues that the dumping margins found are
not reflective of the actual prices at which Cometals purchased barium
chloride from China. The price did not change from the last review period
to this review period, so the large change in duties is not justified.

<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Dumping margins are determined by comparing
the United States price to foreign market value. Even if U.S. price is
unchanged, changes in foreign market value may result in different dumping
margins. Both U.S. price and foreign market value are based on information
available for this review period, which is independent of facts pertaining
to other review periods.

<T3>Comment 2: </T3>Cometals argues that foreign market value should be
based on the factors of production provided for two factories and not on
the basis of the highest-cost producer. In the original investigation and
the first administrative review, the Department only required information
from Sinochem on the two factories exporting barium chloride to the U.S.
The third factory producing barium chloride does not export it to the U.S.
and therefore information for that factory is irrelevant. Furthermore,
Sinochem has no control over this factory and cannot compel it to provide
information. The factors is controlled locally rather than by the central
government. 

The petitioner argues that the Department's action is consistent with its
well-established policy of requiring data from all significant manufacturing
plants in the country in question and of using the best information available
when the respondent fails to submit such information in a timely fashion.
<T3>Department's Position: </T3>When merchandise covered by an order is
produced in more than one plant and those plants are related under section
773(e)(3) of the Tariff Act, the Department uses the average cost of all
related producing facilities. In this review we determined there are three
plants producing barium chloride, and requested information in order to
determine whether the three plants were related. The response to our request
was inadequate and did not provide sufficient information for us to conclude
that the three plants were not related. Therefore, we have assumed they
are related and production information for each is needed. Since Sinochem
did not provide information regarding factors of production for all three
firms, we used the best information available to determine foreign market
value. 

This decision is based exclusively on information collected in this administrative
review. The facts, insofar as they were presented and known to the Department,
and were used by various parties in their arguments, may well have been
different in prior reviews or the original investigation. However, those
were each separate proceedings, had separate records and were each decided
on the basis of those records. The records of those proceedings are not
relevant to our current administrative review and have not been used to
determine these final results. 

We have not altered our basic method of averaging costs from all related
producers.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Final Results of the Review</ITAG>

Based on our analysis as presented in the preliminary results of review,
with currency conversions corrected to reflect exchange rates on the dates
of sale, we determine that the following margins exist: 

<ITAG tagnum=110>

The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping
duties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between United
States price and foreign market value may vary from the percentages stated
above. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly to
the Customs Service.

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Prompt Payment Act, as amended
in November 1986, allows prepayment audit of transportation Government
bills of lading (GBLs) prior to payment. This authority has been delegated
to DOD. These modified procedures will assist in this function and will
prevent unnecessary delay in payment of the carriers' vouchers.

The following rule is established for all modes of traffic to cover GBLs
for which the total charge(s) is $10,000 or more.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Item: Exception to Billing Procedures:</ITAG>

Individual GBLs for which the total charge for services rendered is $10,000
or more will be submitted on a Public Voucher for Transportation Charges
(SF 1113) separate from other GBLs for which the charges are less than
$10,000. Several GBLs, each having individual charges of $10,000 or more,
may be presented on the same voucher.

The following rule is established for movement of ``GUARANTEED TRAFFIC''
from Defense Depots at Columbus, OH, Memphis, TN, Mechanicsburg, PA, Richmond,
VA, Tracy, CA, and Ogden, UT.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Item: Billing Procedures (GUARANTEED TRAFFIC):</ITAG>

1. Charges for services rendered for GUARANTEED TRAFFIC shipments from
points identified above are shown in block 28 of the GBL. The actual amount
billed when rounded to the nearest dollar will not exceed the amount shown
in block 28 of the GBL.

a. If there is a disagreement with the charges shown in block 28, the carrier
must contact the shipping activity to resolve the disagreement prior to
submitting the bill for payment. If it is determined that the charge(s)
shown in block 28 of the GBL is incorrect, the shipper will prepare a GBL
Correction Notice (SF 1200) showing the correct charges. A copy of this
correction notice must accompany the original bill of lading and voucher
when submitted for payment.

b. If an agreement cannot be reached between the shipper and carrier on
what the charges should be, the carrier will submit this GBL on a separate
voucher to the appropriate finance center which will forward to MTMC for
audit prior to payment.

2. Voucher(s) submitted for payment will include only GBLs covering GUARANTEED
TRAFFIC moved under the solicitation and applicable tender. All vouchers
submitted covering GUARANTEED TRAFFIC shipments must contain the statement
``GUARANTEED TRAFFIC'' either stamped or printed in bold letters on the
face of the voucher.

<T2>ACTION: </T2>Notice of intent to prepare an FEIS supplement.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>The Walla Walla District Corps of Engineers proposes
to provide Wilma Habitat Management Unit (171 acres) to the Port of Wilma
in exchange for the Henley Property (742 acres), which will be acquired
by the Port for the purpose of exchange. Both of these properties are located
along the Snake River in southeastern Washington. The exchange will allow
the port to expand its facilities while providing the Corps with land suitable
for wildlife habitat development.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Comments concerning the project
and draft supplemental EIS should be addressed to Chief, Environmental
Resources Branch, Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District, Walla Walla,

Shelin at (509) 522-6626.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>1. The Port of Wilma has requested
to obtain Wilma Habitat Management Unit (HMU) which is Corps of Engineers
project land (171 acres) along the north shore of the Snake River, river
mile 134-135, in Lower Granite Reservoir. The parcel is currently managed
to partially fulfill wildlife compensation requirements for the Lower Snake
River project. In exchange, the Port proposes to offer to the Corps the
Henley Property (742 acres), which is the land along the north shore of
the Snake River, river mile 68-69, in the Lower Monumental Reservoir (Lake
Herbert G. West) just downstream from Little Goose Dam. The proposed land
exchange would allow the Port to expand its facilities located immediately
adjacent to and upstream of Wilma HMU. In exchange the Corps would receive
land adjacent to Snake River project lands suitable for wildlife habitat
development.

2. Alternatives to be investigated include:

A_No action.

B_Land exchange as proposed (includes filling of shallow water habitat
by the Port).

C_Land exchange, but no filling of shallow water habitat by the Port.

D_Land exchange, but the Port acquires property other than Henley Property
for exchange.

E_Sale of Wilma HMU to the Port, Port provides money for habitat development
on existing Corps property.

G_Sale of Wilma HMU to the Port, no exchange of land or money for habitat
development.

3. Significant issues to be addressed in the draft supplement include effects
of the alternatives on wildlife, fisheries, endangered species, existing
wildlife compensation program, cultural resources, port development, and
socioeconomics. The project will be reviewed under all applicable Federal,
state, and local statutes.

4. Affected Federal, state, and local agencies, affected Indian tribes,
and other interested organizations and parties are invited to participate
in scoping for the draft supplement. A formal scoping meeting is not planned,
however, comments should be directed to the address given below.

5. The draft supplement should be available on or about March 3, 1989.

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2>

<ITAG tagnum=84>Background</ITAG>

The Pacific Northwest/Pacific Southwest Intertie presently consists of
a 1956-megawatt (MW) direct current (DC) line and a 3,200-MW alternating
current (AC) Intertie system. BPA owns the DC line and the majority of
the AC Intertie in the Northwest. The remaining Northwest portion of the
AC Intertie is owned by Portland General Electric Company and Pacific Power
and Light Company. The capacity of the DC line is being expanded to 2986
MW via increasing the capability of converter stations at either end of
the DC line. This Terminal Expansion Project is scheduled for energization
in February 1989. The Califorina-Oregon Transmission Project/Third AC Intertie
Project would add an additional 1,600 MW to the capacity of the AC Intertie.
On September 27, 1988, BPA issued a Record of Decision indicating its intent
to construct, operate, and maintain the Third AC Intertie in the Pacific
Northwest. Should this project proceed as planned, the total capacity of
the Intertie would increase to approximately 7800 MW in 1992.

Prior to deciding to proceed with the Third AC Intertie, the BPA Administrator
considered three environmental impact statements. The California-Oregon
Transmission Project EIS addressed the impacts of line construction in
California and substation upgrades in the Northwest needed to develop the
Third AC Intertie. The Eugene/Medford EIS addressed the effects of upgrading
from 230 kilovolts (kV) to 500 kV a line running between Eugene, Oregon
and Medford, Oregon. This upgrade is an integral part of the plan of service
for the Third AC Intertie. In addition, BPA prepared and considered the
Intertie Development and Use Environmental Impact Statement (IDU EIS).

The IDU EIS addresses the potential environmental effects of changes in
resource operations and development occasioned by an expanded Intertie
system used in conjunction with BPA's Long-Term Intertie Access Policy
(LTIAP). The IDU EIS analysis assumes that all non-Federal access to the
Federal portion of the Intertie will be governed by the provisions of the
LTIAP. The non-Federal participation EIS will be tiered to the IDU EIS
pursuant to 40 CFR 1502.20 of the Council on Environmental Quality's Regulations
for Implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).   

In June 1987, several members of the U.S. House of Representatives asked
BPA to study the possibility of allowing Pacific Northwest utilities an
opportunity to participate in the Third AC Intertie. BPA's ``Final Study
of Non-Federal Participation in the Northern Portion of the Third AC Intertie''
was published in March 1988. BPA is now defining the terms under which
it proposes to offer non-Federal participation.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Proposal for Non-Federal Participation  </ITAG>

BPA's proposal for non-Federal participation addresses the amount of Intertie
to be made available, the financial terms for participation, the rights
of participants, and restrictions placed on participants. A maximum of
725 MW of Intertie capacity would be offered to participants. The price
would be based on the actual cost of the new Third AC facilities and reinforcements
plus the depreciated replacement costs of related existing facilities.
BPA's current estimate is $248/kilowatt (kW) in 1991 dollars. Participants
also would pay a proportional annual charge for operations and maintenance,
replacement, and other related items. In return, participants would receive
contractual rights to schedule power over a specified amount of BPA's share
of Third AC capacity resulting from increases from 4,000 to 4,800 MW. The
contract rights would expire at the end of the year 2016, which is the
expiration of the agreements governing BPA's use of Pacific Power and Light's
facilities for Intertie purposes. Participants would have a one-time opportunity
to choose to wheel for third-parties and arbitrage over their Third AC
scheduling right which, if selected, would preclude the participant from
obtaining additional access under the LTIAP. Although no restrictions are
proposed on new nonhydro resource development, participants would be restricted
from developing or acquiring the output of new hydro resources in Protected
Areas, as defined in BPA's LTIAP (i.e., designated stream reaches inside
the Columbia River Basin). Furthermore, BPA's obligation to serve participants'
loads under current power sales contracts would be reduced by the amount
of any export energy sales made by participants over the Intertie; however,
the reduction in obligation would become effective for nonhydro resources
only at such time as BPA reaches energy load/resource balance. Additional
terms and conditions will be developed, considered, and analyzed during
the processes of negotiation and environmental review.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Scope of Environmental Analysis  </ITAG>

The EIS on non-Federal participation will address the potential environmental
effects of implementing BPA's proposal for non-Federal participation and
of reasonable alternatives to the proposal. It is anticipated that potential
environmental effects of the proposal would be the result of changes in
the development or operation of generation resouces enabled by the implementation
of non-Federal participation in the Third AC Intertie. The EIS will address
effects on river operations, downstream juvenile fish passage, upstream
adult migration, resident fish propagation in reservoirs, recreation, cultural
resources, nonrenewable resource consumption, and air quality.  

Alternatives that BPA may analyze, in addition to the proposal, include
providing access to the Third AC Intertie only under the terms of the LTIAP
as addressed in the IDU EIS. This would represent BPA's ``no action'' alternative.
Another alternative that may be studied is operating under the LTIAP but
allowing an increase in the amount of assured delivery with or without
additional restrictions. Participation as described in the preferred alternative
but with the following variations also may be studied: increased restrictions
on the development of new resources for export purposes; extending the
protected areas concept regionwide; and eliminating the provision for reduction
of BPA's obligation to serve the load of participants in an amount equal
to their export sales. BPA also may study alternative amounts of and costs
for participation.

Assessment</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=44>December 23, 1988.</ITAG>

In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR
Part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing
has reviewed the application for amendment of license for the Christine
Falls Hydroelectric Project located on the Sacandaga River in Hamilton
County, near the Village of Speculator, New York, and has prepared an Environmental
Assessment (EA) for the proposed amendment. In the EA, the Commission's
staff has analyzed the potential environmental impacts of the proposed
amendment and has concluded that approval of the proposed amendment, would
not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality
of the human environment.

Copies of the EA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch,
Room 1000, of the Commission's offices at 825 North Capitol Street, NE.,
Washington, DC 20426.

<ITAG tagnum=52>Trunkline Gas Co.; Refund Requirement</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=44>December 23, 1988</ITAG>

Take notice that on December 16, 1988, Trunkline Gas Company (Trunkline)
filed its report of refunds applicable to Docket No. RP87-15 rates that
were in effect during the period May 1, 1987 through November 30, 1988.
At the outset, Trunkline calls attention to the fact that in compliance
with Order No. 297, but without prejudice to judicial review, it has filed
the tariff sheets eliminating the fixed cost minimum bill applicable to
its sales customers under Rate Schedules P-1 and P-2, the only services
to which such minimum bill had applied, accepted by Commission order issued
on June 23, 1988. Trunkline states that all operations and services from
June 23, 1988 have been conducted without a fixed cost minimum bill, by
reason of the Commission's orders. 

Trunkline states that the Docket No. RP87-15 rates were superseded by new
rates on December 1, 1988 in Docket No. RP88-180, subject to the outcome
of that proceeding. Hence, the Docket No. RP87-15 period is a locked in
period extending from May 1, 1987 to November 30, 1988. 

Trunkline states that it has fully refunded the entire rate increase amounts
paid by its sales customers for the entire period of the increased rates
in this proceeding and that no further refunds are due. 

Trunkline states that this report presents new material concerning the
magnitude of the refunds that have been paid to sales customers which had
previously made minimum bill payments for 1987, and states that this material
was not available when Trunkline filed its earlier refund report on June
8, 1988. 

Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a
motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with
Rules 214 and 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18
CFR 385.214, 385.211 (1988). All such motions or protests should be filed
on or before January 4, 1989. Protests will be considered by the Commission
in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to
make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become
a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file
with the Commission and are available for public inspection.

<ITAG tagnum=28></ITAG>
<NOTE></NOTE>\1\Section 381.103 of the Commission's Regulations provides
that the filing date is the date on which the required filing fee was paid.
Section 381.208 of the Regulations provides that if the fee for the initial
report submitted under &Section; 284.223(f)(i) of the Regulations is paid,
no fee is required for a blanket certificate request. In this case the
initial report and the related fee were not submitted until December 22,
1988. Although Panhandle submitted its request on December 15, 1988, consistent
with the above, the filing date of the request should be considered December
22, 1988.

Specifically, Panhandle requests authority to transport up to 60 dt equivalent
of natural gas per day on an interruptible basis for Amgas pursuant to
a transportation agreement dated October 3, 1988, between Panhandle and
Amgas. Panhandle states that the transportation agreement provides for
Panhandle to receive gas from various receipt points on its system in Texas,
Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan and redeliver
the gas, less fuel and unaccounted-for line loss to Central Illinois Light
Company in Tazewell County, Illinois.

Panhandle indicates it would provide the service for a primary term of
one month from the date of initial transportation and continue to provide
the service on a month-to-month basis until terminated by either party
upon at least 30 days prior notice to the other. Panhandle states that
it would charge the rates and abide by the terms and conditions of its
Rate Schedule PT.

It is indicated that the estimated maximum daily volume, average volume,
and annual volumes would be 60 dt equivalent of natural gas, 30 dt equivalent
of natural gas, and 10,950 dt equivalent of natural gas, respectively.
Panhandle states it commenced a 120-day transportation service for Amgas
on November 21, 1988, as reported in Docket No. ST89-1408-000.

Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance
of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the
Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or
notice of intervention and pursuant to &Section; 157.205 of the Regulations
under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If
no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity
shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed
for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30
days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall
be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to section 7 of
the Natural Gas Act.

to the Office of Federal Activities at (202) 382-5074.

An explanation of the ratings assigned to draft environmental impact statements
(EISs) was published in FR dated April 22, 1988 (53 FR 13318).

<ITAG tagnum=84>Draft EISs</ITAG>

ERP No. D-BLM-G65048-NM, Rating LO, White Sands Resource Management Plan,
McGregor Range, Implementation, Otero County, NM.

<T3>Summary: </T3>EPA has no objections to proposed project and concurs
with BLM's preferred Alternative C. Specific comments offered for BLM's
consideration included: (1) Minimizing vegetation disturbance to arroyo
habitats by limiting mineral and livestock activities in these areas, and
(2) Developing site specific watershed management plans for review by resource
agencies.

ERP No. D-COE-K60018-CA, Rating EO2, Los Angeles Raiders Football Stadium,
Parking and Associated Facilities Development, Land Use Change and Implementation,
Santa Fe Dam Flood Control Basin and Recreation Area, City of Irwindale,
Los Angeles County, CA.

<T3>Summary: </T3>EPA expressed environmental objections because proposed
project features could eliminate or degrade a major portion of an alluvial
sage scrub habitat, a scarce regional resource. EPA asked that the Corps
of Engineers not lease, sublease or declare as excess property any of the
178 acres of Federal property within the Santa Fe Flood Control Basin.

ERP No. DS-FHW-A41710-NY, Rating LO, Southern Tier Expressway Construction,
Corning Area, Painted Post to NY-414, Reevaluation of Alternatives and
Updated Information, Funding, Steuben County, NY.

<T3>Summary: </T3>EPA has no objections to the project as proposed. However,
we have requested that the final supplemental EIS contain more specific
information concerning mitigation measures to improve and maintain aquatic
habitats.

ERP No. D-UMT-K54018-CA, Rating EC2, Colma BART Station Project, Transit
Improvements, Funding, San Mateo County, CA.

<T3>Summary: </T3>EPA expressed environmental concerns that the proposed
project would adversely affect the water quality and beneficial uses of
the Colma Creek drainage basin without a firm commitment to adopt and implement
effective mitigation measures.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Final EISs</ITAG>

ERP No. F-BLM-K61088-CA, California Section 202 Wilderness Study Areas
(WSAs) Wilderness Recommendations, South Warner Contiguous and Carson Iceberg
WSAs, Wilderness Designation Recommendation, Modoc County, CA and Alpine
County, NV.

<T3>Summary: </T3>Review of the final EIS was not deemed necessary. No
formal comments were sent to the agency.

ERP No. F1-BLM-K61088-CA, California Section 202 Wilderness Study Areas
(WSAs) Wilderness Recommendation, Garcia Mountain, Rockhouse, Domeland,
Machesna, Yolla Bolly and Big Butte WSAs', Nonwilderness Designation Recommendations,
San Obispo, Tulare, Kern, Tehama, Mendocino and Trinity Counties, CA.

<T3>Summary: </T3>Review of the final EIS was not deemed necessary. No
formal comments were sent to the agency.

ERP No. F-BLM-L67018-AK, Beaver Creek Watershed, Placer Mining Management
Plan, Approval and 404 Permit, Implementation, White Mountain National
Recreation Area, Anchorage, AK.

<T3>Summary: </T3>EPA supports the additional placer mining reclamation
components which have been incorporated into the Proposed Action, although
the final EIS remains unclear what criteria would be considered in implementing
the reclamation measures. Therefore, EPA has remaining concerns regarding
the degree of actual improvement in environmental conditions that may result
from the Proposed Action. EPA is also concerned that a limited data base,
predictive uncertainties, and potential cumulative effects is difficult
to determine the significance of conclusions regarding water quality and
habitat effects from placer mining discharges.

ERP No. FB-COE-K36014-CA, Santa Ana River Mainstream and Santiago Creek
Multipurpose Flood Control Project, Additional Alternatives and Updated
Information, Riverside, Orange and San Bernardino Counties, CA.

<T3>Summary: </T3>EPA expressed its continuing objections concerning adequate
mitigation measures for the loss of aquatic and riparian habitats, including
the loss of a productive trout fishery, and the project's lack of full
compliance with the Clean Water Act section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, which
regulate the discharge of dredged or fill materials into waters of the
United States.

ERP No. F-FHW-B50006-ME, Fore River Bridge/Million Dollar Bridge/ME-77
Rehabilitation or Replacement, Broadway in South Portland to York Street
in Portland, Section 10 and 404 Permits, USCG Bridge Permit and Funding,
Fore River, Cumberland County, ME.

<T3>Summary: </T3>EPA has determined that the final EISs' preferred alternative,
the modified Down Stream_Broadway alignment does not comply with the 404(b)(1)
Guidelines. EPA requests that FHWA and MDOT reconsider the selection of
the rehabilitation, the DS/WO long alignment and the DS/W Low-level long
alignment which we believe are environmentally acceptable. EPA will recommend
that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers deny the Section 404 permit for this
document's preferred alternative.

ERP No. F-FHW-K40158-CA, I-5/Santa Ana Freeway Widening and Interchanges
Reconstruction, CA-22/57 Interchange to CA-55, Funding and 404 Permit,
Orange County, CA.

<T3>Summary: </T3>EPA expressed continuing concerns about the project's
potential to exacerbate air quality problems in the South Coast Air Basin,
an area which currently experiences serious violations of the National
Ambient Air Quality Standards. EPA asked that the Record of Decision contain
a commitment to implement applicable transportation control measures found
in the Area Quality Management Plan and other measures to improve air quality.

ERP No. F-FRC-A99183-00, Regulations Governing Independent Power Producers
(RM88-4-000) and Regulations Governing Bidding Programs (RM88-5-000), Implementation.

<T3>Summary: </T3>EPA's concerns are that (1) the consequences of ``global
warming'' could have adverse environmental impacts and need to be addressed
in EISs that involve shifts in energy sources or consumption and, (2) we
continue to recommend that FERC consider methods to link state adoption
of bidding programs to load management and conservation.

<T2>ACTION: </T2>Notice.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>The Federal Home Loan Bank Board (``Board'') is supplementing
earlier resolutions concerning American Savings and Loan Association, Stockton,
California (``American'') and its successor, American Savings, A Federal
Savings and Loan Association (``American Federal''), to provide that the
protections afforded to certain persons and entities engaged in certain
transactions with American or American Federal will be afforded to such
persons or entities engaged in similar transactions with an association
(hereinafter designated as ``Collecting Association'') to which certain
of the assets (including mortgage-backed securities) and liabilities of
American Federal may be transferred. The Board is also indicating its intention
to authorize Collecting Association to enter into certain security agreements
with broker-dealers and their affiliates.
</ITAG>

Counsel for FSLIC, (202) 377-6428; or Deborah E. Siegel, Attorney, Office

G Street NW., Washington, DC 20552.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Board has adopted the following
resolution: 

Whereas, The Federal Home Loan Bank Board (``Board'') has previously adopted
Resolutions No. 88-149 and 88-463 regarding ``Repos'' and ``Financial Contracts''
of American Savings and Loan Association, Stockton, California (``American''),
and the Board has supplemented such Resolutions to apply to ``Repos'' and
``Financial Contracts'' of American Savings, A Federal Savings and Loan
Association (``American Federal'') pursuant to Resolution No. 88-947 (as
so supplemented, respectively the ``Repo Resolutions'') and the ``Financial
Contracts Resolutions''); and

Whereas, The Board has previously adopted Resolution No. 88-29, regarding
``special accounts'' of insured institutions, the Executive Director of
the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (``Corporation'') has
issued certain commitments, in accordance with that Resolution, regarding
``special accounts'' of American in a letter to Mr. William Popejoy dated
June 27, 1988 (including Annex A and Schedule A thereto), (``Commitment
Letter''), the Board has supplemented such Resolution and Commitment Letter
to apply to ``special accounts'' of American Federal, and the Executive
Director of the Corporation supplemented the Commitment Letter, in accordance
with such Resolutions, to apply to ``special accounts'' of American Federal
in a letter, dated September 12, 1988, to William Popejoy (collectively,
the ``CD Commitment''); and

Whereas, The Board has determined that the extension of the commitment
regarding payment of insurance would ensure liquidity for a successor association
to American Federal, and that such action would serve to reduce the operating
losses and potential cost of liquidation of any such successor association;
and

Whereas, The Board desires to supplement the Repo Resolutions, the Financial
Contracts Resolutions and the CD Commitment (which supplementation the
Board does not consider to be an amendment or rescission of such Resolutions
and Commitment) to take into account a transfer of certain assets (including
mortgage-backed securities) and liabilities of American Federal to an institution
the accounts of which are insured by the Corporation (``Collecting Association''),
and to provide the same protections and commitments to counterparties to
Repos and Financial Contracts entered into with, or transferred from, American
Federal to Collecting Association and to holders of ``special accounts''
in Collecting Association or in such accounts transferred from American
Federal to Collecting Association; and

Whereas, The Executive Director of the Corporation, to implement the policy
set forth in Resolution No. 88-29, in letters to William Popejoy dated
July 25, 1988, and July 29, 1988, authorized American to enter into a security
agreement in a form substantially similar to the security agreement attached
to and referenced in such correspondence (``Security Agreement''), and
by letter dated October 4, 1988, extended such authorization to apply to
American Federal; and

Whereas, Collecting Association may desire to enter into a security agreement
with broker-dealers or their affiliates in a form substantially similar
to the Security Agreement (a copy of which is in the Minute Exhibit File),
and such action would serve to reduce the operating losses and potential
cost of liquidation of Collecting Association:

Now, Therefore, the Board resolves as follows:

1. Collecting Association, upon acquisition of assets and liabilities of
American Federal, is hereby designated as eligible to receive the benefits
of Board Resolution No. 88-29.

2. All references in the Repo Resolutions, the Financial Contracts Resolutions
and the CD Commitment to ``American'', ``American Savings'' and ``American
Federal'' shall also be references to Collecting Association, and the Repo
Resolutions and Financial Contracts Resolutions, as supplemented hereby,
shall apply to ``Repos'' and ``Financial Contracts'' entered into by Collecting
Association or transferred from American Federal to Collecting Association,
and the CD Commitment, as supplemented hereby, shall apply to special accounts
in Collecting Association or transferred from American Federal to Collecting
Association.

3. Collecting Association, upon acquisition of assets and liabilities of
American Federal, is hereby authorized to enter into a security agreement
with broker-dealers or their affiliates in a form substantially similar
to the Security Agreement.

4. There resolutions shall be effective immediately upon their adoption
by the Board.

5. The Secretary of the Board shall forward these resolutions for publication
in the 
<T4>Federal Register</T4>.

<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Board has adopted the following
resolution:

Whereas, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (``Board'') had previously adopted
Resolution no. 87-616, dated June 3, 1987, regarding the acceptance by
American Savings and Loan Association, Stockton, California (``Old American'')
of brokered deposits up to a maximum limit of $2.5 billion of total deposits
(``Brokered Deposit Resolution''); and 

Whereas, the Board, by its Resolution No. 88-924, dated September 5, 1988,
appointed the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (``Corporation'')
as receiver for Old American, and pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement
dated September 6, 1988 between the Corporation and American Savings, A
Federal Savings and Loan Assoication (``American Federal''), the Corporation
transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Old American
to American Federal; and

Whereas, the authorizations granted to Old American pursuant to the Brokered
Deposit Resolution were extended to American Federal pursuant to Board
Resolution No. 88-959, dated September 12, 1988; and

Whereas, the Board desires to supplement the Brokered Deposit Resolution
(which supplementation the Board does not consider to be an amendment or
rescission of such resolution or of any supplement thereto) to take into
account a transfer of American Federal's brokered deposits to an institution
the accounts of which are insured by the Corporation (hereinafter designated
as ``Collecting Association''), and to provide the same authorizations
to Collecting Association as were provided to Old American and American
Federal:

Now, Therefore, the Board Resolves as Follows:

1. All rights and authorizations granted to Old American and American Federal
pursuant to the Brokered Deposit Resolution (as supplemented by Board Resolution
No. 88-959) shall be extended to Collecting Association upon acquisition
of certain assets (including mortgage-backed securities) and liabilities
(including brokered deposits) of American Federal.

2. All references in the Brokered Deposit Resolution to ``American'' and
``American Savings'' shall also be references to Collecting Association.

<ITAG tagnum=50>FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION</ITAG>

The Federal Maritime Commission hereby gives notice that the following
items have been submitted to OMB for review pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3601, et. seq.). Requests for information, including
copies of the collection of information and supporting documentation, may
be obtained from John Robert Ewers, Director, Bureau of Administration,
Federal Maritime Commission, 1100 L Street NW., Room 12211, Washington,
DC 20573, telephone number (202) 523-5866. Comments may be submitted to
the agency and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office
of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officer
for the Federal Maritime Commission, within 15 days after the date of the
<T4>Federal Register</T4> in which this notice appears.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Summary of Items Submitted for OMB Review</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=56>
<T3>46 CFR Part 552_Financial Reports of Vessel Operating Common Carriers
by Water in the Domestic Offshore Trades and Related Forms FMC-355 and
FMC-378</T3></ITAG>

FMC requests an extension of clearance for regulations which establish
methodologies to be used in evaluating rates filed by vessel operating
common carriers in the domestic offshore trades who are subject to the
Intercoastal Shipping Act, 1933. Total estimated annual burden for 13 tug
and barge operators and 20 self-propelled operators is 2559.6 manhours.
Total estimated annual cost to the Federal Government is approximately
$17,050; total estimated annual cost to respondents is approximately $44,000.

<ITAG tagnum=56>
<T3>46 CFR Part 553_Financial Exhibits and Schedules of Non-Vessel-Operating
Common Carriers in the Domestic Offshore Trades and Related Form FMC-379</T3></ITAG>

FMC requests extension of clearance for regulations which will facilitate
the orderly acquisition of data required in those instances where the Commission
institutes an investigation and hearing with respect to proposed rate changes
by non-vessel operating common carriers in the domestic offshore trades
subject to the Shipping Act, 1933.

Although no reports have been received in the past eight years, potential
estimated respondent universe is 60 with an estimated 300 manhours per
year. The annual cost to the Federal Government and respondents is nominal
because there is no reason to believe that a significant number of reports
will be received during the renewal period.

</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2> This notice of proposed operation and
maintenance rates and related information is published under the authority
delegated to the Assistant Secretary_Indian Affairs by the Secretary of
the Interior in 230 DM 1 and delegated by the Assistant Secretary_Indian

This notice is given in accordance with &Section; 171.1(e) of Part 171,
Subchapter H, Chapter I, of Title 25 of the Code of Federal Regulations,
which provide for the Area Director to fix and announce the rates for annual

Hall Irrigation Project for Calendar Year 1989 and subsequent years. This
notice is proposed pursuant to the authority contained in the Acts of March
1, 1907 (34 Stat. 1024), and August 31, 1954 (68 Stat. 1026).

The purpose of this notice is to announce the increase in the Fort Hall
Project assessment rates proportionate with actual operation and maintenance
costs. The proposed assessment rates for 1987 will amount to an increase
of $1.00 per acre for the Michaud Unit due to an increase in power rates.
The public is welcome to participate in the rule making process of the
Department of the Interior. Accordingly, interested persons may submit

<T4> Federal Register</T4>.
Administration

The Fort Hall Irrigation Project, which consists of the Fort Hall Unit
including ceded area south of the Fort Hall Indian Reservation, the Michaud
Unit and the Minor Units on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation, Idaho, is
administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Superintendent of the
Fort Hall Agency is the Officer-in-Charge and is fully authorized to carry
out and enforce the regulations, either directly or through employee designated
by him. The general regulations are contained in Part 171, Operation and
Maintenance, Title 25_Indians, Code of Federal Regulations.
Irrigation System

Water will be available for irrigation purposes from April 15 to September
30 of each year. These dates may be varied by 15 days depending on weather
conditions and the necessity for doing maintenance work.
Methods of Irrigation

Where soil, topography, and other physical conditions are unfavorable for
surface irrigation, and the project facilities are designed to deliver
water to farm units for sprinkler irrigation, the Officer-In-Charge may
limit deliveries to this type of irrigation.
Distribution and Apportionment of Water

(a)
<T3> Delivery.</T3> Water for irrigation purposes will be delivered throughout
the irrigation season by either the continuous flow or rotation method
at the discretion of the Officer-in-Charge. If during a time when delivery
is by the rotation method, a water user desires to loan his turn to another
eligible water user, he shall notify either the watermaster or the ditch
rider who may permit such exchange, if feasible.

(b)
<T3> Preparation and submission of water schedule.</T3> If the decision
of the Officer-in-Charge is to deliver water by the rotation method, the
watermaster will assist the water users on each lateral in preparing a
rotation schedule should they choose to get together and prepare the schedule.
In cases where the water users fail to exercise this right before March
1, the watermaster will prepare the schedule which shall be final for the
seasons. Owners of 120 acres or more in one farm unit may elect between
the continuous flow and rotation method of delivery, provided such choice
does not interfere with delivery to other lands served by the lateral.

(c)
<T3> Application for deliveries of irrigation water.</T3> Requests for
water changes will be made at least 24 hours in advance. Not more than
one change will be made per day. Changes will be made only during the ditch
rider's regular tour. Pump shut-down, regardless of duration, without the
required notice will result in the delivery being closed and locked. Repeated
violations of this rule will result in strict enforcement of rotation schedules.
Water users will change their sprinkler lines without shutting off more
than one-half of their lines at one time. Sudden and unexpected changes
in ditch flow results in operating difficulties and waste of water.
Duty of Water

Dependent upon available supplies of water for each unit of the Project,
the duty of water is based on the delivery to the farm unit of 3.5 acre-feet
of water per acre per irrigation season. This duty of water may be varied
at the discretion of the Officer-in-Charge depending on supplies available,
but each irrigable acre shall be entitled to its pro-rata share of the
total water supply.
Charges

Bills covering irrigation charges will be issued to the owner of record
taken from the Bannock, Bingham or Power County records as of December
31, preceding the due date. In the case of Indian-owned land leased to
a non-Indian, when an approved lease contract is on file with the superintendent
of the Fort Hall Agency, operation and maintenance charges will be billed
to the lessee of record.
Basic and Other Water Charges

(a) The annual basic water charges for the operation and maintenance of
the Fort Hall Irrigation Project lands in non-Indian ownership, and assessable
Indian-owned lands leased to a non-Indian or a non-member of the Shoshone-Bannock
Tribes of the Fort Hall Indian Reservation, Idaho, are fixed for the Calendar
Year 1989 and subsequent years until futher notice as follows:

(1) Fort Hall Unit basic rate_$17.00 per acre.

(2) Michaud Unit Basic rate_$23.00 per acre.

Additional rate for sprinkler when pressure is supplied by project_$8.50
per acre.

(3) Minor Units basic rate_$14.00 per acre.

(b) In addition to the foregoing charges there shall be collected a minimum
charge of $5 for the first acre, or fraction thereof, on each tract of
land for which operation and maintenance bills are prepared. The minimum
bill issued for any Area will, therefore, be the basic rate per acre plus
$5.
Payments

The water charges become due on April 1 of each year and are payable on
or before that date. To all assessments on lands in non-Indian ownership,
and lands in Indian ownership which do not qualify for free water, remaining
unpaid on or after July 1 following the due date shall be considered delinquent.
No water shall be delivered to any farm unit until all irrigation charges
have been paid.
Interest and Penalty Fees

Interest and penalty fees will be assessed, where required by law, on all
delinquent operation and maintenance assessment charges as prescribed in
the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 4, Part 102, Federal Claims Collection
Standards; and 42 BIAM Supplement 3, part 3.8 Debt Collection Procedures.
Assessments on Indian Owned Land

When land owned by members of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of the Fort Hall
Indian Reservation is first leased to non-Indians or non-members of the
tribe, and an approved lease is on file at the Fort Hall Agency, the leased
land is not subject to operation and maintenance assessments for three
years. The three years the land is not subject to assessment need not run
consecutively. When land has been leased for a total of three years, the
land, when under lease to non-Indians or non-members of the tribe, is subject
to operation and maintenance assessments the same as lands in non-Indian
ownership and lands owned by non-members of the tribe within the project.
(See Solicitor's Opinion M 28701, approved September 24, 1936, and the
instructions of September 19, 1938, approved September 24, 1938, and instructions

C-48635, C-48636, Clear Creek County, Colorado.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>SUMMARY: </T2>The following described public lands are being examined
for classification and disposal under the Recreation and Public Purposes
(R &amp; PP) Act of June 14, 1926 (43 U.S.C. 869) and the regulations thereunder
(43 CFR Part 2740):

<ITAG tagnum=24>Sec. 24: all BLM land in W\1/2\NW\1/4\.</ITAG>
<ITAG tagnum=21>Containing approximately 2,860 acres.</ITAG>

The Town of Silver Plume, the Town of Georgetown and Clear Creek County
have applied for these lands. The proposed uses include recreation, historic
preservation, watershed management and water development. Approximately
2,200 acres lie within the existing Georgetown-Silver Plume National Historic
Landmark District.

The proposed classification would be consistent with BLM land use plans
for the area. A final BLM decision will be made after survey and title
problems involving the land are resolved.

Publication of this notice will segregate these lands from all appropriation,
including mineral entry, except applications under the R &amp; PP Act.
It will not affect any existing, valid claims.

Segregation will terminate upon rejection of any application, upon publication
of a notice of termination, or when lease or patent issues.

Any patent issued for these lands, under the R &amp; PP Act will reserve
all minerals to the United States, and will contain a clause which would
result in the lands reverting back to the United States if the use of the
land is altered or if the land is transferred.
</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=10>
<T2>DATES: </T2>Interested parties may submit comments on this action for
a period of 45 days after publication of this notice. Comments should be
directed to the District Manager, P.O. Box 311, Canon City, Colorado 81212.
Objections will be reviewed and this realty action may be sustained, vacated,
or modified. In the absence of any objection resulting in vacation or modification,
this realty action will become final.

3. The land in Sections 10 and 11, T. 17 S., R. 3 E., will not be opened
to operation of the public land laws, including the mining laws because
it has been proposed to be designated as an outstanding natural area.

4. At 8:30 a.m., on February 6, 1980, the lands described in paragraph
2, except as provided in paragraph 3, will be open to operation of the
public land laws generally or if appropriate, to such Forms of Disposition
as may by law be made of Revested Oregon and California Railroad Grant
Lands, subject to valid existing rights, the provisions of existing withdrawals,
and the requirements of applicable law. All valid applications received
at or prior to 8:30 a.m., on February 6, 1989, will be considered as simultaneously
filed at that time. Those received thereafter will be considered in the
order of filing.

5. At 8:30 a.m., on February 6, 1989, the lands described in paragraph
2, except as provided in paragraph 3, will be open to location and entry
under the United States mining laws. Appropriation of land under the general
mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized.
Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession
under 30 U.S.C. Sec. 38, shall vest no rights against the United States.
Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession
are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau
of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between rival locators
over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations
in local courts.

6. At 8:30 a.m., on February 6, 1989, the lands described in paragraph
2, will be open to applications and offers under the mineral leasing laws.

<ITAG tagnum=56>Southern Railway_Carolina Division and Southern Railway Co._Abandonment
and Discontinuance of Service_in York County, SC</ITAG>

The Commission has issued a certificate and decision authorizing: (1) Southern
Railway-Carolina Division (SCD) to abandon its 4.7-mile line of railroad
from milepost SB-110.5 near Tirzah, SC, to milepost 115.2 at York, SC;
(2) SCD's parent, Southern Railway Company (SOU), to abandon its 3.91-mile
connecting line from milepost HG 22.79 to milepost HG 26.70 near York;
and (3) SOU to discontinue service over SCD's line. Both lines are located
in York County, SC. The abandonment certificate will become effective February
2, 1989, unless within 15 days after publication the Commission also finds
that: (1) A financially responsible person has offered financial assistance
(through subsidy or purchase) to enable the rail service to be continued;
and (2) it is likely that the assistance would fully compensate the railroad.

Any financial assistance offer must be filed with the Commission and the
applicant no later than January 13, 1989. The following notation must be
typed in bold face on the lower left-hand corner of the envelope containing
the offer: ``Rail Section, AB-OFA.'' Any offer previously made must be
remade within this 10-day period.

Information and procedures regarding financial assistance for continued
rail service are contained in 49 U.S.C. 10905 and 49 CFR 1152.27.

<ITAG tagnum=41>[Docket No. STN 50-528]</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=56>Arizona Public Service Co., et al., Consideration of Issuance of Amendment
to Facility Operating License and Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration
Determination and Opportunity for Hearing</ITAG>

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering
issuance of an amendment to Facility Operating License No. NPF-41, issued
to Arizona Public Service Company, et al., (the licensees),\1\
<NOTE></NOTE> for operation of the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station,
Unit 1 located in Maricopa County Arizona. The request for amendment was
submitted by letter dated December 23, 1988.

<ITAG tagnum=28></ITAG>
<NOTE></NOTE>\1\ The other licensees are the Salt River Project Agricultural
Improvement and Power District, El Paso Electric Company, Southern California
Edison Company, Public Service Company of New Mexico, Los Angeles Department
of Water and Power, and Southern California Public Power Authority.

The proposed amendment would revise Technical Specification Surveillance
Requirement 4.1.3.1.2 to allow continued operation of Unit 1 until the
end of the current cycle (approximately three months), without conducting
any further exercise tests of Control Element Assembly (CEA) 64. The proposed
change will eliminate a potentially challenging operating condition. The
plant may be unnecessarily challenged during performance of testing on
CEA No. 64 because this CEA has slipped during previous rod motion testing
due to an intermittent ground on the CEA's lower gripper coil.

Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will
have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended
(the Act) and the Commission's regulations.

The Commission has made a proposed determination that the amendment request
involves no significant hazards considerations. Under the Commission's
regulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility
in accordance with the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant
increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;
or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from
any accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction
in a margin of safety.

A discussion of these standards as they relate to this amendment follows:

<ITAG tagnum=84>Criterion 1</ITAG>

The proposed change would not increase the probability or consequences
of any accident previously evaluated since the proposed change is still
within the bounds of the current safety analyses. The proposed change is
intended to reduce the probability of a reactor transient due to a dropped
rod. The licensees have provided the following discussion:

<ITAG tagnum=21>The basis for Surveillance Requirement 4.1.3.1.2 is to demonstrate
that all applicable CEAs are capable of being inserted into the core when
required. All performances of this test to date conclusively show that
CEA &plusmin;64 can be inserted into the core. Additionally, Unit 1 has
experienced six reactor trip events during the current cycle of operation.
During each reactor trip, CEA &plusmin;64 fell into the core as required.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=21>It is unlikely that an obstruction would develop between now and the
end of the current cycle that would render CEA &plusmin;64 untrippable.
However, even if CEA &plusmin;64 would not drop into the core when required,
this condition is within the bounds of the safety analyses. All analyses
in which shutdown CEA reactivity is critical require that the most reactive
CEA be assumed to remain stuck outside the core * * *. In addition, shutdown
margin * * * would not be adversely affected by this change because it
is determined by considering a single malfunction resulting in the highest
worth CEA failing to insert.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=84>Criterion 2</ITAG>

The proposed change would not create the possibility of a new or different
kind of accident from any previously analyzed since it would not introduce
new systems, modes of operation, failure modes or other plant perturbations.
The lower gripper coil for CEA-64 would only be energized during CEA inward
or outward motion. The coil is not energized when the reactor is tripped
nor during steady state operation. Therefore, the requested Technical Specification
change will not create the possibility of an accident or malfunction of
a different type than those already evaluated in the FSAR.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Criterion 3</ITAG>

The proposed change would not involve a significant reduction in the margin
of safety. The license stated:

<ITAG tagnum=21>The requested change for CEA &plusmin;64 will not reduce the margin
of safety as defined in the basis for the Technical Specifications. All
performances of the CEA exercise testing to date have conclusively shown
that CEA &plusmin;64 can be inserted into the core. CEA &plusmin;64 has
successfully fallen into the core as required during 6 reactor trip events
during the current cycle of operation. Additionally, the safety analyses
already address the condition where the single most reactive CEA fails
to drop into the core during design basis events.</ITAG>

Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that this change does
not involve significant hazards considerations.

The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.
Any comments received within 15 days after the date of publication of this
notice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commission
will not normally make a final determination unless it receives a request
for a hearing.

Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory Publications
Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office
of Administration and Resources Management, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number
of the 
<T4>Federal Register</T4> notice.

Written comments may also be delivered to Room P-216, Phillips Building,
7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies
of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document
Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC. The filing
of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed
below.

By January 18, 1989, the licensees may file a request for a hearing with
respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating
license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding
and who wishes to participate as a part in the proceeding must file a written
request for hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for
a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance
with the Commission's ``Rule of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings''
in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene
is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety
and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and
the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will
issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.

As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set
forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,
and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.
The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should
be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) The
nature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to the
proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,
or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of any
order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.
The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subject
matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any
person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been
admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of
the Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference
scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy
the specificity requirements described above.

Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference
scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the
petition to intervene, which must include a list of the contentions that
are sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contention
set fort with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited to matters
within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitioner who
fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with
respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate
as a party.

Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject
to any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have the
opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including
the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

If the amendment is issued before the expiration of 30-days, the Commission
will make a final determination on the issue of no significant hazards
considerations. If a hearing is requested, the final determination will
serve to decide when the hearing is held.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significant
hazards considerations, the Commission may issue the amendment and make
it effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearing held
would take place after issuance of the amendment.

If the final determination is that the amendment request involves significant
hazards considerations, any hearing held would take place before the issuance
of any amendment.

Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration
of the 15-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during
the notice period, such that failure to act in a timely way would result,
for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may
issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 15-day notice
period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves
no significant hazards considerations. The final determination will consider
all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this
action, it will publish a notice of issuance. The Commission expects that
the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.

A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filed
with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may be
delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,
2120 L Street, NW, Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitions are
filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested
that the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone
call to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).
The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number
3737 and the following message addressed to George W. Knighton: petitioner's
number and telephone number; date petition was mailed; plant name; and
publication date and page number of this 
<T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. A copy of the petition should also be
sent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,
Washington, DC 20555, and to: Arthur C. Gehr, Esq., Snell &amp; Wilmer,
3100 Valley Center, Phoenix, Arizona 85007, Attorney for the licensees.

Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,
supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertained
absent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or the
presiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board that the petition and/or request
should be granted based upon a balancing of the factors specified in 10
CFR 2.714(a)(1) (i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

For further details with respect to this action, see the application for
amendment dated December 23, 1988, which is available for public inspection
at the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,
DC 20555, and at the Local Public Document Room, Phoenix Public Library,
Business and Science Division, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix, Arizona
85004.

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15
U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on December 19, 1988, the
American Stock Exchange, Inc. filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III below, which
Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission
is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change
from interested persons. 

<ITAG tagnum=84>I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance
of the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>

The American Stock Exchange, Inc. is increasing the supplemental listing
fee and annual fee imposed on listed company equity issues. The schedule
of fee increases is available at the Office of the Secretary, American
Stock Exchange and at the Commission. 

<ITAG tagnum=84>II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>

In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included
statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change
and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The
text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item

<ITAG tagnum=81>(1) Purpose</ITAG>

The Exchange is increasing two fees imposed on listed companies. The fee
for supplemental stock listings is being raised from $.015 to $.02 per
share, with the minimum fee increasing from $1,000 to $2,000 and the maximum
fee increasing from $12,000 to $17,500. The annual fee for stocks, with
separate categories based on the number of outstanding shares, is being
increased starting in 1989, the minimum fee increasing from $3,500 to $4,500
and the maximum fee increasing from $10,000 to $12,500, with each category
increasing by $500 from the minimum level of $4,500 to the maximum of $12,500.

<ITAG tagnum=81>(2) Basis</ITAG>

The Exchange fee increases are consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act
in general and further the objectives of Section 6(b)(4) of the Act in
particular in that they are intended to assure the equitable allocation

<ITAG tagnum=56>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Proposed Rule Change by Depository
Trust Company Relating to Securities Clearing Group Filing  </ITAG>

Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15
U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on December 8, 1988, the
Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II, and III
below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization.
The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed
rule change from interested persons.  

<ITAG tagnum=84>I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance
of the Proposed Rule Change  </ITAG>

The proposed rule change being filed by the Depository Trust Company (``DTC'')
consists of the referenced Agreement \1\
<NOTE></NOTE> underlying the filing, in which the seven registered clearing
agencies who are members of the Securities Clearing Group agree to share
information about common participants with each other for regulatory purposes.
 

<ITAG tagnum=28></ITAG>
<NOTE></NOTE>\1\ For a copy of the text of the proposed rule change, 
<T3>see</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 23600 (November 21, 1988);
53 FR 48353 (November 30, 1988).  
<ITAG tagnum=84>II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  </ITAG>

In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included
statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change.
The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in
Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries,
set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant
aspects of such statements.  
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory
Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  

The purpose of the proposed rule change is to formalize DTC's existing
practices with regard to information sharing and provide for future developments
in this area. The agreement attached to the filing as Exhibit 2 is the
first formalization of the efforts of the Securities Clearing Group, which
is comprised at the present time of seven registered clearing agency self-regulatory
organizations. The goal of the group is to identify and create procedures
to minimize risks posed by participants in more than one clearing agency
self-regulatory organization. The key method for achieving this goal will
be the sharing of appropriate financial, operational and clearing data
on common participants among members of the Securities Clearing Group for
regulatory purposes.  

The proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder
because it is designed to contribute to the safeguarding of securities
and funds in DTC's custody or control for which it is responsible, to foster
cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in the clearance and
settlement of securities transactions and, in general, to protect investors
and the public interest.  
(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 
DTC does not believe that the proposed rule change will impose any burden
on competition.  
(c) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed
Rule Change Received from Members, Participants or Others  

Comments have not been solicited or received.  

<ITAG tagnum=84>III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing
for Commission Action  </ITAG>

Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 
<T4>Federal Register</T4> or within such longer period (i) as the Commission
may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to
which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: 
(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or  

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change
should be disapproved.  

<ITAG tagnum=84>IV. Solicitation of Comments  </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=84>I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance
of the Proposed Rule Change  </ITAG>

The proposed rule change would amend NSCC's Rule 39 as follows: italics
indicate additions and [Brackets] indicate deletions.  

<ITAG tagnum=81>Rule 39. Special Representative  </ITAG>
<ITAG tagnum=37>* * * * * </ITAG>

A Special Representative
<T3>:</T3>

<T3>(1) </T3>Who operates an automated execution system where the Special
Representative is always the contra side to each transaction, or  

<T3>(2) Whose parent corporation or affiliated corporation operates an
automated execution system where the Special Representative is always the
contra side to each transaction, </T3>or 

<T3>(3) That clears for a broker/dealer who operates an automated execution
system where the broker/dealer is always the contra side to each transaction,
and the subscribers to the automated execution system enter into an agreement
with the broker/dealer and the Special Representative acknowledging the
Special Representative's role in the clearance of trades executed on the
automated execution system; </T3>

[(]hereinafter referred to throughout the Rules as a ``Qualified Special
Representative''[)], or such other Special Representatives as the corporation
may permit in its discretion, may elect to submit in automated form, trade
data from such automated execution systems as a locked-in trade which appear
on T-contracts.  

<ITAG tagnum=37>* * * * *  </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=84>II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  </ITAG>

In its filing with the Commission, the NSCC included statements concerning
the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any
comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements
may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. NSCC has prepared
summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant
aspects of such statements.  
(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory
Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change  

(a) The purpose of the proposed rule change is to increase the availability
to NSCC Members of one-sided trade input for transactions executed on an
automated execution system. One-sided trade input results in a compared
trade as of the close of business on trade date at a reduced cost. Members
who use this process are called Qualified Special Representatives. Currently,
NSCC defines Qualified Special Representatives as Members who operate an
automated execution system where the Member is always the contra side to
each transaction. It has come to NSCC's attention that there are other
ways in which automated execution systems are operated, which could benefit
from earlier trade comparison at a reduced cost. The changes to the rule
will allow for the expanded use of this vehicle by such entities.  

(b) NSCC believes the proposed rule change will promote the prompt and
accurate clearance and settlement of securities and foster cooperation
and coordination with other persons engaged in the clearance and settlement
of securities transactions.  

Thus, the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (``Act''), and the rules and regulations
thereunder applicable to NSCC.  
(B) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition 
NSCC does not believe that the proposed rule will have an impact or impose
a burden on competition.  
(c) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed
Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others  

Comments on the proposed rule change have not been solicited or received.
NSCC will notify the Securities and Exchange Commission of any written
comments received by NSCC.  

<ITAG tagnum=84>III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing
for Commission Action  </ITAG>

Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the 
<T4>Federal Register</T4> or within such longer period (i) as the Commission
may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to
which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: 
(A) By order approve such proposed rule change, or  

(B) Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change
should be disapproved.  

<ITAG tagnum=84>IV. Solicitation of Comments  </ITAG>

Interested person are invited to submit written data, views and arguments
concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file
six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission,
450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all

<ITAG tagnum=56>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Options Clearing Corporation; Notice
of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule Change</ITAG>

Pursuant to section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''),
notice is hereby given that on December 9, 1988, the Options Clearing Corporation
(``OCC'') filed with the Commission a proposed rule change (File No. SR-OCC-88-08).
As described below, the proposal would change in OCC By-laws the location
of a provision describing OCC's cross-margining service. The Commission
is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change
from interested persons.

On October 3, 1988, the Commission approved an OCC proposal permitting
the cross-margining of securities options cleared by OCC with futures and
commodity options cleared by the Intermarket Clearing Corporation (``ICC'').\1\
<NOTE></NOTE> In that proposal, OCC stated that its cross-margining service
would be described in Article VI, section 20 of OCC's By-laws. Prior to
Commission approval of cross-margining, however, OCC inadvertently placed
in Article VI, section 20 a provision concerning the clearance of international
transactions. OCC's current proposal would amend OCC's prior reference
to Article VI, section 20 as the location of the cross-margining provision
and would clarify that the cross-margining service will be described in
Article VI, section 23 of OCC's By-laws.

<ITAG tagnum=28></ITAG>
<NOTE></NOTE>\1\ 
<T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26153 (October 3, 1988),
53 FR 39567.

The foregoing change has become effective, pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)
of the Act and subparagraph (e) of Rule 19b-4, because it constitutes a
stated policy, practice, or interpretation with respect to the administration
of an existing OCC rule. At any time within 60 days of the filing of such
proposed rule change, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule change
if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate
in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in
furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments
concerning the submission within 21 days after the date of publication
in the 
<T4>Federal Register.</T4> Persons desiring to make written comments should
file six copies thereof with the Secretary of the Commission, Securities
and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Reference
should be made to File No. SR-OCC-88-08.

Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements
with respect to the proposed rule change which are filed with the Commission,
and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between
the Commission and any person, other than those which may be withheld from
the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available
for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Room, 450
Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of the filing (SR-OCC-88-08)
and of any subsequent amendments also will be available for inspection
and copying at OCC's principal office.

<ITAG tagnum=56>Issuer Delisting; Application to Withdraw From Listing and Registration;
Matrix Corp.</ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=44>December 23, 1988.</ITAG>

Matrix Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities
and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, (``Act'') and rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw
the above specified securities from listing and registration on the American
Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Exchange'').

The reasons cited by the Company in its applications for withdrawing these
securities from listing and registration included the following:

On November 10, 1988, AGI Sub, Inc. (``Sub'') was merged with and into
the Company. The Company was the surviving corporation in the merger. Sub
is a wholly_owned subsidiary of Agfa_Gevaert, Inc. (``AGI''). At the effective
time of the merger AGI become the record and beneficial owner of 100% of
the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. Effective
on December 31, 1988, AGI presently plans to merge the Company with and
into itself, with AGI to be the surviving corporation in the December 31
merger. As part of this December 31 merger, it is contemplated that AGI
will assume the obligations of the Company under the 8\1/4\% Debentures
and the 7\1/2\% Debentures.

The Company has given serious consideration to the question of whether
it wishes to continue the listing of the Debenutres on the Exchange after
the merger of the Company into AGI. The Company has concluded that (a)
there is limited trading activity in the Debentures on the Exchange, (b)
the Debentures are no longer convertible into common stock of the Company,
but may be converted solely into the amount of cash which each holder of
a Debenture would have received if such holder had converted such Debenture
into common stock immediately before the effective time of the Merger and
(c) the considerable expense and the time of Company personnel required
to continue preparing and filing the periodic reports required by the Act
is disproportionately high in relation to the number of record holders
of each series of Debentures, the principal amount of the Debentures outstanding
and the volume of trading activity in the Debentures on the Exchange.\1\
<NOTE></NOTE>

<ITAG tagnum=28></ITAG>
<NOTE></NOTE>\1\ The Company's November 30, 1988 letter to the Exchange
states that the 8\1/4\% Debentures have 59 record holders, with outstanding
principal amount of $16,375,000 and the 7\1/2\% Debenture have 64 record
holders with $12,165,000 outstanding principal amount. (These numbers exclude
those debentures owned of record and beneficially by Bayer, USA, Inc.,
an indirect beneficial owner of the Company.)

In view of the above factors the Company believes it is no longer appropriate
to comply with sections 13, 14 and 15 of its Listing Agreement with the
Exchange (
<T3>i.e., </T3>the requirements that it solicit proxies for all meetings
of security holders of record, that it maintain at least two independent
directors on its Board of Directors and that it not enter into material
transactions with officers, directors, principal shareholders, affiliates,
or other specified related entities without notifying the Exchange and
obtaining approval of a disinterested majority of its Board of Directors)
and, accordingly, does not intend to do so. Furthermore, in view of the
above factors, after the December 31, 1988, Merger, AGI will not file any
substitute listing application with the Exchange for the continued listing
of the Debentures on the Exchange.

Any interested person may, on or before January 17, 1989, submit by letter
to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street,
NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has
been made in accordance with the rules of the Exchange and what terms,
if any should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors.
The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an
order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the
Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.

<ITAG tagnum=84>Applicant's Representations</ITAG>

1. Applicant, organized as a Maryland corporation and open-end diversified
management investment company under the 1940 Act, filed a Notification
of Registration pursuant to section 8(a) of the 1940 Act on Form N-8A,
and a registration statement pursuant to section 8(b) on March 22, 1983.
Applicant's registration statement became effective on June 10, 1983.

2. On September 21, 1987, Applicant's Board of Directors adopted its proposed
Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution (``Plan'') and called a Special Meeting
of Shareholders to consider Applicant's dissolution and liquidation. According
to the minutes of the meeting of the Board of Directors on September 21,
1987, the Applicant's adviser had notified Applicant that it had elected
to terminate its position as adviser to the Applicant. The Board of Directors
had taken into account the cost to, and the impact on, the Applicant that
would be associated with obtaining the services of another investment adviser,
merging the Applicant's assets with another mutual fund or liquidating
and dissolving the Applicant. The Board determined that the cost and impact
associated with liquidation and dissolution would be materially lower than
those associated with the other alternatives. On November 19, 1987, at
the Special Meeting, the shareholders approved the liquidation and dissolution
of Applicant pursuant to the Plan.

3. As of the date of filing its Application, Applicant had distributed
$5,046,502.45 in cash to its securityholders in complete redemption of
their shares. Each securityholder received an amount per share representing
the net asset value per share on the distribution date, November 30, 1987.
As of March 1, 1988, 16,452 shares out of a total of 724,942.017 shares
of common stock remained outstanding.

4. Applicant has not within the past eighteen months transferred any of
its assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries of which were or are
securityholders of the Applicant. Applicant has retained $49,742.80. in
cash for the purpose of making distributions to its remaining 26 securityholders,
whom it has been unable to locate. Applicant has placed its remaining assets
in a bank account out of which liquidation distributions will be paid to
such securityholders upon receipt of certificates for a period of three
years commencing December 2, 1987. At the end of this period, remaining
funds will be paid over to the State of New York under the Abandoned Property
Act.

5. As of September 7, 1988, Applicant had no other liabilities or debts
outstanding, was not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding,
and was not engaged in, nor intended to engage in, any business activities
other than those necessary for the winding up of its affairs. As of that
date, Applicant was current on all filings required to be made under the
1940 Act.

6. On January 27, 1988, Articles of Dissolution were filed with the Secretary
of State of Maryland pursuant to Maryland general corporate law. Applicant
was dissolved effective February 1, 1988.

The above-numbered physical disaster declaration (53 FR 38826) is hereby
amended to reopen the filing period for 30 days. Section 120 of Pub. L.
100-590 (11/88) reduces the interest rate for non-profit organizations
without credit available elsewhere to a maximum of 4 percent; Section 121
provides that a physical disaster loan may be increased by up to 20 percent
for necessary or appropriate mitigation measures, and Section 122 provides
that no physical disaster loan for $10,000 or less shall require collateral.
The filing period is reopened to afford an opportunity to those disaster
victims who (1) may not have filed because of the high interest rate, (2)
may not have requested disaster loans because of the previous requirement
for loans over $5,000 of whatever reasonable collateral was available,
or (3) may now wish to take advantage of the opportunity for additional
funding for mitigation measures. The termination date for filing physical
disaster loan applications is January 31, 1989.

The above numbered economic injury declaration is amended to include contiguous
counties. Section 120 of Pub. L. 100-590 (11/88) provides, 
<T3>inter alia, </T3>that areas affected by an economic injury disaster
include counties contiguous to the counties determined to be disaster areas
by the President, Secretary of Agriculture, or the Administrator of the
Small Business Administration. This amendment adds the contiguous county
of Hardee, in the State of Florida, to give economic injury disaster victims
in that county the opportunity to request EIDLs. The termination date for
filing EIDL applications remains the same.

<ITAG tagnum=52>TABLE OF EFFECTIVE DATES AND TIME PERIODS_JANUARY 1989 </ITAG>

<ITAG tagnum=69>

This table is used by the Office of the Federal Register to compute certain
dates, such as effective dates and comment deadlines, which appear in agency
documents. In computing these dates, the day after publication is counted
as the first day.

When a date falls on a weekend or holiday, the next Federal business day
is used. (See 1 CFR 18.17)

A new table will be published in the first issue of each month.
